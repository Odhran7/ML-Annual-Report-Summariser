 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

coterra energy inc “coterra” “our” “we” and “us” is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploration and production of oil natural gas and ngls our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable development programs we operate in one segment oil and natural gas development exploration and production in the continental us 

our headquarters is located in houston texas we also maintain regional offices in pittsburgh pennsylvania midland texas and tulsa oklahoma 

on october 1 2021 we completed a merger transaction the “merger” with cimarex energy co “cimarex” cimarex is an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in texas new mexico and oklahoma under the terms of the merger agreement relating to the merger the “merger agreement” and subject to certain exceptions specified in the merger agreement each eligible share of cimarex common stock was converted into the right to receive 40146 shares of our common stock at closing as a result of the completion of the merger we issued approximately 4082 million shares of common stock to cimarex stockholders excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of certain previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards additionally on october 1 2021 we changed our name to coterra energy inc 

as a result of the merger we added substantial assets and operations in the permian basin in texas and new mexico and the anadarko basin in oklahoma as of december 31 2021 the proved reserves attributable to the cimarex legacy operations represented 25 percent of our total proved reserves on a boe basis the merger has provided us with geographic commodity and asset diversification with exposure to oil natural gas and ngls which we believe will provide us with greater resiliency to market fluctuations and other factors impacting any single commodity region or basin we believe we have a multidecade inventory of highreturn development locations in each of our premier oil and natural gas basins in the us with our approximately 177000 net acres in the marcellus shale approximately 306000 net acres in the permian basin and approximately 182000 net acres in the anadarko basin we believe the merger will generate longterm value for our stockholders and positions us to be a premier exploration and production company with the size scale inventory and financial strength to deliver sustainable returns through various commodity price cycles 

as of the effective time of the merger our board of directors was reconstituted to consist of ten members with five of the directors being persons who previously served on our board of directors and five persons who previously served on the cimarex board of directors also as of the effective time of the merger we made changes to our executive management team including appointing mr dan o dinges our former president and chief executive officer as our executive chairman of the board of directors and appointing mr thomas e jorden cimarex’s former chief executive officer and president as our chief executive officer and president 

certain operational information set forth in this annual report on form 10k does not include the activity of cimarex for periods prior to the completion of the merger 

strategy 

coterra is a premier usfocused exploration and production company we embrace innovation technology and data as we work to create value for our investors our team members and the communities where we operate we believe the following strategic priorities will help drive value creation and longterm success 

generate sustainable returns our premier assets disciplined capital investment and strong cash flow generation through the commodity price cycles give us the confidence to provide returns to our stockholders that we believe to be sustainable demonstrating our confidence in our business model we increased our annual base dividend on our common stock to 050 per share following the consummation of the merger and again in february 2022 to 060 per share since october 1 2021 we have returned 652 million to stockholders through baseplusvariable and special dividends furthermore and consistent with our returnsfocused strategy in february 2022 our board of directors also approved a new 125 billion share repurchase program that replaced our previously announced share repurchase program together with our baseplusvariable dividend we remain committed to returning at least 50 percent of our free cash flow to our stockholders supplementing any of these returns periodically with our share repurchase program all while staying focused on the 30 percent of cash flow from operations threshold in all but the lowest commodity environments 

disciplined capital allocation across toptier position we believe that we hold the ability to generate sustainable returns across our asset portfolio which offers scale capital optionality and low breakeven investment options we anticipate our drilling inventory will be developed over multiple decades at the current runrate we are committed to maintaining a 

table of contents 

disciplined capital investment strategy and using technology and innovation to maximize capital efficiency and operational execution we believe that having three operating regions the marcellus shale permian basin and anadarko basin offers diversity of geography and commodity and revenue streams which should support strong and stable cash flow generation through commodity price cycles in the fourth quarter of 2021 we invested 44 percent of our cash flow from operations in our drilling program and returned 080 per share to stockholders via dividend payments 

maintain financial strength we believe that maintaining an industryleading balance sheet with significant financial flexibility is imperative in a cyclical industry exposed to commodity price volatility we believe that our asset base revenue diversity lowcost structure and strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility we need to thrive across various commodity price environments with no significant debt maturities until 2024 a yearend 2021 cash balance of 10 billion and 15 billion of unused commitments under our revolving credit facility we believe we are well positioned to maintain our balance sheet strength 

focus on safe responsible and sustainable operations we believe responsible development of oil and natural gas resources provides opportunity for a bright future one built through technology and innovation that offers prosperity for both today and tomorrow our operational focus is based on making our operations more environmentally and socially sustainable by actively implementing technology across our operations from design phase to equipment improvements to limit and reduce our methane emissions and flaring activity our safety programs are built on a foundation that emphasizes personal responsibility and safety leadership in addition we focus on practical and sustainable environmental initiatives that promote efficient use of water and help to protect water quality eliminate or mitigate releases and minimize land surface impact we are committed to being responsible stewards of our resources and implementing sustainable practices under the guidance of our management team and our diverse and experienced board of directors 

2022 outlook 

our 2022 capital program is expected to be approximately 1400 million to 1500 million of which 1225 million to 1325 million is allocated to drilling and completion activities we expect to turninline 134 to 153 total net wells in 2022 across our three operating regions approximately 49 percent of drilling and completion capital will be invested in the permian basin 44 percent in the marcellus shale and the balance in the anadarko basin midstream saltwater disposal electrification infrastructure and other investments are expected to total approximately 175 million in the year 

description of properties 

our operations are primarily concentrated in three operating areas—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania the permian basin in west texas and southeast new mexico and the anadarko basin in the midcontinent region in oklahoma 

marcellus shale 

our marcellus shale properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 177000 net acres in the dry gas window in the marcellus shale our 2021 net production in the marcellus was 389 mboepd representing 85 percent of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2021 we had a total of 9540 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 99 percent are operated by us 

during 2021 we invested 594 million in the marcellus where we exited 2021 with two drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2022 with two rigs operating 

permian basin 

our permian basin properties are principally located in the western half of the permian basin known as the delaware basin where we currently hold approximately 306000 net acres in the play our development activities are primarily focused on the wolfcamp shale in culberson and reeves counties in texas and lea and eddy counties in new mexico our 2021 net production in the permian basin which represents the production from this basin subsequent to the completion of the merger on october 1 2021 was 211 mboepd representing 12 percent of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2021 we had a total of 11644 net wells in the permian basin of which approximately 79 percent are operated by us 

during 2021 we invested 147 million in the permian basin which represents the amount invested in the basin subsequent to the completion of the merger we exited 2021 with six drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2022 with six rigs operating 

table of contents 

anadarko basin 

our anadarko basin properties are principally located in oklahoma where we currently hold approximately 182000 net acres in the play our development activities are primarily focused on the woodford shale and the meramec formation both in oklahoma our 2021 net production in the anadarko basin which represents the production from this basin subsequent to the completion of the merger on october 1 2021 was 59 mboepd representing three percent of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2021 we had a total of 5680 net wells in the anadarko basin of which approximately 57 percent are operated by us 

during 2021 we invested 2 million in the anadarko basin which represents the amount invested in the basin subsequent to the completion of the merger at the end of 2021 we had no rigs operating in the play but in the first half of 2022 subject to market conditions we plan to have up to two rigs in the play 

other properties 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of natural gas and saltwater disposal gathering systems the majority of our gathering infrastructure is located in texas and directly supports our permian basin operations our gathering systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines natural gas processing facilities and produced water disposal facilities control of our gathering pipeline systems also enables us to transport natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying on third parties to transport our natural gas or produced water and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

marketing 

substantially all of our oil and natural gas production is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts we sell oil natural gas and ngls to a broad portfolio of customers including industrial customers local distribution companies oil and gas marketers major energy companies pipeline companies and power generation facilities 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the winter months 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our oil and natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the us the majority of our marcellus and anadarko basin natural gas production is gathered on thirdparty gathering systems while the majority of our permian basin natural gas production is gathered on companyowned and operated gathering systems most of our natural gas is transported on interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

delivery commitments 

we have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell natural gas we believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of our commitments but may be required to purchase natural gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur 

a summary of our firm sales commitments as of december 31 2021 are set forth in the table below 

we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas under the majority of these firm sales contracts and have entered into numerous agreements for transportation of our production some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms however we do not believe we will have any financial commitment due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations

risk management 

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our oil and natural gas production although there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap roll differential swaps and basis swap agreements designed to assist us in managing price risk the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2021 oil collars with floor prices ranging from 2900 to 4000 per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 3415 to 5110 per bbl covered 37 mmbbls or 45 percent of oil production at a weightedaverage price of 4437 per bbl oil basis swaps covered 32 mmbbls or 40 percent of oil production at a weightedaverage price of 008 per bbl oil roll differential swaps covered 16 mmbbls or 20 percent of oil production at a weightedaverage price of 010 per bbl 

during 2021 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 150 to 285 per mmbtu and ceiling prices ranging from 175 to 394 per mmbtu covered 1932 bcf or 21 percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 285 per mmbtu natural gas swaps covered 563 bcf or six percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 316 per mmbtu 

as of december 31 2021 we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives

3 the index price for these collars is waha west texas natural gas index “waha” as quoted in platt’s inside ferc 

in early 2022 we entered into the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 

a significant portion of our expected oil and natural gas production for 2022 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in oil and natural gas prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion related to our use of derivatives

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves as of the dates indicated 

  

1 proved undeveloped reserves for 2021 2020 and 2019 include reserves drilled but uncompleted of 80 mmboe 40 mmboe and 131 mmboe respectively 

our proved reserves at december 31 2021 increased 614 mmboe or 27 percent from 2279 mmboe at december 31 2020 primarily due to the merger which increased our proved reserves by 672 mmboe during 2021 we added 171 mmboe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the results from our drilling and completion program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we had a net downward revision of 62 mmboe which was primarily due to a net downward performance revision of 97 mmboe partially offset by an upward pricing revision of 34 mmboe during 2021 we produced 167 mmboe 

at december 31 2021 our dimock field which is located in the marcellus shale in susquehanna county pennsylvania contained approximately 75 percent of our total proved reserves 

our reserves are sensitive to commodity prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audits of such estimates by miller and lents ltd “miller and lents” and degolyer and macnaughton and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factors—business and operational risks—our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation

internal control 

our senior vice president production and operations is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of 10 engineers he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 39 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 30 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents and degolyer and macnaughton independent petroleum engineers to perform independent audits of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management and the board of directors 

miller and lents has audited 100 percent of our proved reserves estimates related to our marcellus shale properties and degolyer and macnaughton has performed an independent evaluation of estimated net reserves representing greater than 80 percent of the total future net revenue discounted at 10 percent attributable to our proved reserves estimates related to our permian basin anadarko basin and other properties excluding our marcellus shale properties each of miller and lents and degolyer and macnaughton concluded in its judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues 

copies of the audit letters by miller and lents dated january 31 2022 and degolyer and macnaughton dated january 17 2022 have been filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2021 we had future development costs of 21 billion associated with 764 mmboe of pud reserves which represents a decrease of 80 mmboe compared to december 31 2020 by the end of 2022 we expect to complete substantially all the work necessary to convert our pud reserves associated with wells that were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2021 to proved developed reserves future development plans are reflective of the current commodity price environment and have been established based on expected available cash flows from operations as of december 31 2021 all pud reserves are expected to be drilled and completed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves mmboe 

table of contents 

changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 

• transfer of 264 mmboe from pud to proved developed reserves based on total capital expenditures of 565 million during 2021 

• new pud reserve additions of 131 mmboe in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania 

• purchases of reserves in place of 97 mmboe which are primarily related to the merger and are primarily located in the permian basin and 

• downward pud reserve revisions of 44 mmboe mainly due to performance revisions in the marcellus shale

the following table sets forth information about wells for which drilling was in progress or which were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2021 which are not included in the above table 



other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties we conduct preliminary investigations of record title at the time of lease acquisition we conduct more complete investigations prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and 

table of contents 

natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our concentrated acreage positions and our access to both thirdparty and companyowned gathering and pipeline infrastructure in our primary operating areas along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the year ended december 31 2021 no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2020 three customers accounted for approximately 21 percent 16 percent and 12 percent of our total sales if any one of our major customers were to stop purchasing our production we believe there are a number of other purchasers to whom we could sell our production if multiple significant customers were to stop purchasing our production we believe there could be some initial challenges but we have ample alternative markets to handle any sales disruptions 

we regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and may require parent company guarantees letters of credit or prepayments when necessary historically losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo frequent review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

regulation of natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the us natural gas act of 1938 the “nga” the us natural gas policy act of 1978 the “ngpa” and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the us federal energy regulatory commission the “ferc” regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 “2005 act” the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and ngpa and the ferc’s regulations thereunder up to 1 million per day per violation this maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation the current maximum penalty is over 1 million per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

under the ngpa natural gas gathering facilities are expressly exempt from ferc jurisdiction what constitutes “gathering” under the ngpa has evolved through ferc decisions and judicial review of such decisions we believe that our 

table of contents 

gathering and production facilities meet the test for nonjurisdictional “gathering” systems under the ngpa and that our facilities are not subject to federal regulations although exempt from ferc oversight our natural gas gathering systems and services may receive regulatory scrutiny by state and federal agencies regarding the safety and operating aspects of the transportation and storage activities of these facilities 

our natural gas sales prices continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rule makings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of the ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by the us congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions 

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar swap roll differential swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act “dodd‑frank act” in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum 

sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act “ica” the ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the 

table of contents 

actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 percent should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 in 2020 the ferc concluded its fiveyear index review to establish the new adder for crude oil and liquids pipeline rates subject to indexing the ferc issued an order on december 17 2020 establishing an index level of producer price index for finished goods plus 078 percent for the fiveyear period commencing july 1 2021 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or any potential future challenges to pipelines rates

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment public health natural resources and wildlife and relating to safety matters permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities and potential suspension or cessation of operations under certain conditions related to environmental considerations or compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations we can provide no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those regulating emissions into the atmosphere discharges of pollutants into waters underground injection of wastewater the generation storage transportation and disposal of waste materials and removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment and those relating to occupational health and safety 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some wastes that are hazardous wastes subject to the us federal resource conservation and recovery act the “rcra” and comparable state statutes as well as wastes that are exempt from such regulation the us environmental protection agency the “epa” limits the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess the need to regulate exploration and production related oil and gas wastes exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra under subtitle d applicable to nonhazardous solid waste the consent decree required the epa to propose a rulemaking by march 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary in april 2019 the epa issued its determination that based on its review including consideration of state regulatory programs it was not necessary at the time to revise subtitle d regulations to address the management of oil and gas wastes in the future we could be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than we encounter today 

superfund the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated 

table of contents 

or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s hazardous substances definition we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 the “opa” and implementing regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the us the term “waters of the us” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations to the extent applicable to our operations 

endangered species act the us federal endangered species act the “esa” was established to protect endangered and threatened species pursuant to the esa if a species is listed as threatened or endangered restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat the us fish and wildlife service the “fws” may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species a critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and gas development similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the us federal migratory bird treaty act we conduct operations in areas where certain species are currently listed as threatened or endangered or could be listed as such under the esa operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist may require us to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may restrict or preclude our drilling activities in those areas or during certain seasons such as breeding and nesting seasons 

on april 10 2014 the fws published a rule listing as a threatened species under the esa the lesser prairie chicken whose habitat is over a fivestate region including texas new mexico and oklahoma where we conduct a substantial amount of our operations although the 2014 listing rule was vacated in july 2016 on june 1 2021 the fws proposed to list two distinct population segments “dps” of the lesser prairie chicken under the esa the southern dps located in eastern new mexico and the southwest texas panhandle was proposed to be listed as endangered and the northern dps located in southeastern colorado southcentral to southwestern kansas western oklahoma and the northeast texas panhandle was proposed to be listed as threatened listing of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened or endangered species will impose restrictions on disturbances to critical habitat by landowners and drilling companies that would harass harm or otherwise result in a “taking” of this species regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from an ultimate decision to list the lesser prairie chicken could be limited for those landowners and businesses who have entered into certain rangewide conservation planning agreements such as those developed by the western association of fish and wildlife agencies “wafwa” pursuant to which such parties agreed to take steps to protect the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if its actions harm the lesser prairie chicken’s habitat we have entered into a voluntary candidate conservation agreement a “cca” with the wafwa whereby we agreed to take certain actions and limit certain activities such as limiting drilling on certain portions of our acreage during nesting seasons in an effort to protect the lesser prairie chicken 

on february 9 2018 the fws announced the listing of the texas hornshell a freshwater mussel species in areas where we operate in the permian basin including new mexico and texas as an endangered species in march 2018 we entered into a cca concerning voluntary conservation actions with respect to the texas hornshell 

participating in ccas could result in increased costs to us from species protection measures time delays or limitations on drilling activities which costs delays or limitations may be significant listing petitions continue to be filed with the fws which could impact our operations many nongovernmental organizations “ngos” work closely with the fws regarding the listing of many species including species with broad and even nationwide ranges the listing of the mexican long nosed bat whose habitat includes the permian basin where we operate and the dunes sagebrush lizard in the permian basin are examples of the ngos’ influence on esa listing decisions 

on december 1 2020 the fws proposed to list the peppered chub as endangered under the esa the peppered chub is a freshwater fish that historically was found in the south canadian cimarron and arkansas rivers within new mexico texas 

table of contents 

oklahoma and kansas we have operations near the south canadian river in oklahoma that could be impacted if the peppered chub is listed as endangered under the esa or if the fws declares the basins of the south canadian river to be critical habitat the increase in endangered species listings such as the peppered chub may limit our ability to explore for or produce oil and gas in certain areas or cause us to incur additional costs 

clean water act the us federal water pollution control act the “clean water act” and implementing regulations which are primarily executed through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain pollutants into waters of the us sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges to resolve noncompliance we believe that we substantially comply with the applicable provisions of the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to the us federal clean air act the “clean air act” and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permitting requirements federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve any failures to comply strictly with air regulations or permits however in the event of noncompliance regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with applicable emission standards and permitting requirements under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements two examples are the epa’s source aggregation rule and the epa’s new source performance standards “nsps” and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants “neshap” in june 2016 the epa published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry and as a result aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting may result in increased complexity and cost of and time required for air permitting particularly with respect to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in operations 

in 2012 the epa published final nsps and neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap for the oil and natural gas sector in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updated and expanded the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in june 2017 the epa proposed a twoyear stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns in september 2020 the epa published a final rule amending the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and natural gas sector that removed transmission and storage sources from the oil and natural gas industry source category and rescinded the methane requirements applicable to the production and processing sources on june 30 2021 president biden signed into law a joint congressional resolution under the congressional review act disapproving the september 2020 rule amending the epa’s 2012 and 2016 nsps standards for the oil and natural gas sector on november 15 2021 the epa proposed rules to reduce methane emissions from both new and existing oil and natural gas industry sources for additional information please read “risk factors—legal regulatory and governmental risks— federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows” in item 1a 

in october 2015 the epa adopted a lower national ambient air quality standard for ozone the revised standard resulted in additional areas being designated as ozone nonattainment which could lead to requirements for additional emissions control equipment and the imposition of more stringent permit requirements on facilities in those areas the epa completed its final area designations under the new ozone standard in july 2018 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego or implement modifications to certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act the us safe drinking water act “sdwa” and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by us federal or state regulatory authorities that in 

table of contents 

some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing substantially all of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the us federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or to restrict or prohibit the activity altogether for example new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 states in which we operate also have adopted or have stated intentions to adopt laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing such as imposing more stringent permitting disclosure and wellconstruction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing in addition to state measures local land use restrictions such as city ordinances may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing for example pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the authority of the pennsylvania department of environmental protection over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state 

at the federal level the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released its final report in december 2016 it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells this study and other studies that may be undertaken by the epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices 

water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling process and in particular we use a significant amount of water in the hydraulic fracturing process our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used or produced in our exploration and production operations could adversely impact our operations for water sourcing we first seek to use nonpotable water supplies or recycled produced water for our operational needs in certain areas there may be insufficient water available for drilling and completion activities water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site our operations in certain areas could be adversely impacted if we are unable to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations the imposition of new environmental and other regulations including as a result of potential regulatory and legislative changes due to the outcome of the 2020 us congressional and presidential elections as well as produced water disposal well limits or moratoriums in areas of seismicity could further restrict our ability to conduct operations such as hydraulic fracturing by restricting the disposal of waste such as produced water and drilling fluids compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works the regulations were developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

the adoption of us federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations affecting our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells in addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for example a pennsylvania state appellate court in 2018 appeared to refuse to apply the established common law rule of capture in a case concerning claims of trespass by hydraulic fracturing the pennsylvania supreme court heard the appeal of this ruling and on january 22 2020 in briggs v southwestern energy production co 224 a3d 334 “pa 2020” affirmed the rule of capture and remanded the case 

table of contents 

to the pennsylvania state appellate court for further proceedings on december 8 2020 the appellate court issued a nonprecedential decision reversing its previous order vacating the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of southwestern energy production co southwestern the appellate court refuted the assumptions made by the pennsylvania supreme court concerning the appellate court’s disregard of the established rule of capture and based its reversal on the failure of plaintiffs to “specifically allege that southwestern engaged in horizontal drilling that extended onto their property or that southwestern propelled fracturing fluids and proppants across the property line” leaving open the possibility that hydraulic fracturing can constitute a physical invasion and thereby a trespass future developments in case law that expand the ability of adjacent property owners to prevail on trespass claims based on hydraulic fracturing could have a material impact on our operations 

greenhouse gas and climate change laws and regulations in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other greenhouse gases “ghgs” including methane may be contributing to global climate change there is increasing focus by local state regional national and international regulatory bodies as well as by investors and the public on ghg emissions and climate change issues in december 2015 the us joined the international community at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change the “unfccc” in paris france in creating an agreement the “paris agreement” that requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions “ndc” of ghgs which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 the current presidential administration has made climate change a central priority on january 20 2021 his first day in office president biden took action to reverse the withdrawal of the previous administration from the paris agreement so that the us could rejoin as a party to the agreement the us officially rejoined the paris agreement on february 19 2021 and in april 2021 submitted its ndc the us ndc sets an economywide target of net ghg emissions reduction from 2005 levels of 5052 by 2030 the specific measures to be taken in furtherance of achieving this target have not been established but the ndc submission indicated that a “whole government approach” will be used to achieve this target including regulatory technology and policy initiatives designed to reduce the generation of ghg emissions and to incentivize the capture and geologic sequestration or utilization of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted in the atmosphere on his first day in office president biden signed an executive order on climate action and reconvened an interagency working group to establish interim and final social costs of three ghgs carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane carbon dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels including oil natural gas and ngls and methane is a primary component of natural gas the biden administration stated it will use updated social cost figures to inform federal regulations and major agency actions and to justify aggressive climate action as the us moves toward a “100 clean energy” economy with netzero ghg emissions 

although the us congress has considered legislation designed to reduce emissions of ghgs in recent years it has not adopted any significant ghg legislation however the 2021 infrastructure and investment jobs act passed by congress on november 6 2021 included measures aimed at decarbonization to address climate change including funding for replacing transit vehicles including buses with zero and lowemission vehicles and for the deployment of an electric vehicle charging network nationwide this legislation and other future laws that promote a shift toward electric vehicles could adversely affect the demand for our products moreover in the absence of federal ghg legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged these include measures aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions through capandtrade programs which typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs in addition a coalition of over 20 governors of us states formed the us climate alliance to advance the objectives of the paris agreement and several us cities have committed to advance the objectives of the paris agreement at the state or local level as well to this end the california governor issued an executive order on september 23 2020 ordering actions to pursue ghg emissions reductions including a direction to the california state air resources board to develop and propose regulations to require increasing volumes of new zeroemission passenger vehicles and trucks sold in california over time with a targeted ban of the sale of new gasoline vehicles by 2035 

at the federal level the epa has begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other ghgs under existing provisions of the clean air act in december 2009 the epa published its findings that emissions of ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal clean air act that establish prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v permit reviews for ghg emissions from certain large stationary sources that are otherwise subject to psd and title v permitting requirements the epa has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified sources in the us including among others certain oil and gas production facilities on an annual basis which includes certain of our operations the epa widened the scope of annual ghg reporting to include not only activities associated with completion and workover of gas wells with hydraulic fracturing and activities associated with oil and gas production operations but also completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing gathering and boosting systems and transmission pipelines more recently on november 15 2021 the epa proposed rules to reduce methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector 

table of contents 

if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition any future laws or regulations that limit emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to both develop and implement new practices aimed at reducing ghg emissions such as emissions control technologies which could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and gas that we produce to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future implementation or adoption of legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy at this time it is not possible to quantify the impact of any such future developments on our business 

occupational safety and health act and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the us federal occupational safety and health act the “occupational safety and health act” and comparable state laws the occupational safety and health act hazard communication standard the epa community right‑to‑know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to the occupational safety and health act the occupational safety and health administration the “osha” has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety 

human capital resources 

we believe that our ability to attract retain and develop the highest quality employees is a vital component of our success in connection with the merger we developed an integration plan for every corporate functional organization and are in the process of completing staff reorganizations relocations of key employees and hiring of new talent for our corporate headquarters in houston texas staff reductions will occur primarily in our denver colorado office which will eventually be closed and our tulsa oklahoma office which will be dedicated to management of our anadarko basin operations with other corporate functions transferred to houston detailed transition and knowledge transfer plans are intended to ensure that key aspects of ongoing operations are uninterrupted through this process our staff reorganization plans are intended to eliminate redundancy between the legacy company organizations and our hiring plans aim to accelerate our ability to attract and develop a diverse workforce we believe that the resulting employee levels from our integration plan are appropriate and that we will continue to have the human capital to operate our business and carry out our strategy as determined by management and our board of directors 

as of december 31 2021 with the addition of employees as a result of the merger we had 936 total employees 165 of whom were located in our headquarters in houston texas and our corporate office in denver colorado and 417 of whom were located in our regional offices in midland texas tulsa oklahoma and pittsburgh pennsylvania we had a total of 354 employees in production field locations across our regional offices of our total employee population 611 were salaried and 325 were hourly we also have 211 employees that are employed by our wholly owned subsidiary gassearch drilling services corporation “gds” which is a service company engaged in water hauling and site preparation exclusively for our marcellus shale operations of our gds employees 15 were salaried and 196 were hourly as a result of consistent communication and transparent management we believe that our relations with our employees are favorable none of our employees are represented pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement 

in managing our human capital resources we seek to 

• attract retain and develop a highly qualified motivated and diverse workforce 

• maintain a conservatively managed headcount to minimize workforce fluctuations 

• provide opportunities for career growth learning and development 

• offer highly competitive compensation and benefits packages and 

• promote a safe and healthy workplace 

we believe these practices further described below are the key drivers in our development of current and future talent and leadership as well as low voluntary turnover rates which averaged less than five percent over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2021 

recruiting hiring and advancement due to the cyclical nature of our business and the fluctuations in activity that can occur we manage our headcount carefully we provide employees with opportunities to learn new roles and develop the breadth and depth of their skills in an effort to ensure strong talent and future leadership this also helps to minimize layoffs and overall staff fluctuations when downturns occur when a position needs to be filled we generally seek to expand the role or 

table of contents 

promote current employees before going to outside sources for a new hire we believe this practice helps to build future leadership and to reduce voluntary turnover among our workforce by providing employees with new challenges and opportunities throughout their careers 

when we hire from outside the company we identify qualified candidates by promoting the position internally for referrals engaging in recruiting through our website and online platforms utilizing recruiting services and attending job fairs we also have a wellestablished internship program that feeds top talent into our technical functions in our recruiting efforts we foster a culture of mutual respect and compliance with all applicable federal state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment we seek to increase the diversity of our workforce in our external hiring practices we treat all applicants with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender ethnicity religion national origin age marital status political affiliation sexual orientation gender identity disability or protected veteran status this philosophy extends to all employees throughout the lifecycle of employment including recruiting hiring placement promotion evaluation leaves of absence compensation and training 

compensation and benefits our focus on providing competitive total compensation and benefits to our employees is a core value and a key driver of our retention program we design our compensation programs to provide compensation that is competitive with our industry peers and rewards superior performance and for managers and executives aligns compensation with our performance and incentivizes the achievement of superior operating results we do this through a total rewards program that provides 

• base wages or salaries that are competitive for the position and considered for increases annually based on employee performance business performance and industry outlook 

• incentives that reward individual and company performance such as performance bonuses management discretionary bonuses field operational bonuses and shortterm and longterm incentive programs 

• retirement benefits including dollarfordollar matching contributions to a taxqualified defined contribution savings plan for all employees and other nonqualified retirement programs 

• comprehensive health and welfare benefits including medical insurance prescription drug benefits dental insurance vision insurance life insurance accident insurance short and longterm disability benefits employee assistance program and health savings accounts 

• tuition reimbursement for eligible employees scholarship program and matching charitable contributions program and 

• time off sick time parental leave and holiday time 

we believe that our compensation and benefits package is a strong retention tool and promotes personal health and financial security within our workforce 

health and safety the health and safety of our employees is one of our core values for sustainable operations this value is reflected in our strong safety culture that emphasizes personal responsibility and safety leadership both for our employees and our contractors that are on our worksites our comprehensive environmental health and safety “ehs” management system establishes a corporate governance framework for ehs compliance and performance and covers all elements of our operating lifecycle 

our ehs management system provided the framework to implement immediate and comprehensive safety protocols in response to the covid19 pandemic that struck suddenly in early 2020 all of our employees are designated “critical infrastructure workers” under the cybersecurity  infrastructure security agency guidelines and as a result our field operations continued throughout 2020 and 2021 the actions taken to prevent the spread of infection on our worksites and promote the health and safety of our workforce include 

• implementing and providing training on a covid19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols such as face coverings social distancing requirements and personal hygiene measures 

• providing additional personal protective equipment 

• implementing rigorous covid19 selfassessment contact tracing and quarantining protocols 

• increasing cleaning protocols at all locations 

• limiting business travel 

table of contents 

• providing additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid19 cases and 

• encouraging our employees to obtain covid19 vaccinations and providing incentives to do so 

due to these measures all of our operations continued safely and uninterrupted through the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and throughout 2021 we also implemented appreciation award programs for many of our employees who have continued to work onsite during the pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

business and operational risks 

you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities 

commodity prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the oil natural gas and ngls that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile for example the wti oil prices in 2021 ranged from a high of 8465 to a low of 4762 per bbl and nymex natural gas prices in 2021 ranged from a high of 2386 during winter storm uri to a low of 243 per mmbtu any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration and development projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans refer to “future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations” 

wide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil natural gas and ngls market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

• the levels and location of oil natural gas and ngls supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties on the global natural gas supply 

• the level of consumer demand for oil natural gas and ngls which has been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic particularly during 2020 

• weather conditions and seasonal trends 

• political economic or health conditions in oil natural gas and ngl producing regions including the middle east africa south america and the us including for example the impacts of local or international pandemics and disasters or events such as the global covid19 pandemic 

• the ability and willingness of the members of opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 

• the price level and quantities of foreign imports 

• actions of governmental authorities 

• the availability proximity and capacity of gathering transportation processing andor refining facilities in regional or local areas 

• inventory storage levels and the cost and availability of storage and transportation of oil natural gas and ngls 

• the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation including environmental and climate change regulation 

• the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 

• technological advances affecting energy consumption 

• speculation by investors in oil natural gas and ngls 

• variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices and 

table of contents 

• overall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies 

these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict future commodity prices if commodity prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling oil and natural gas wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

• decreases in commodity prices 

• unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents including blowouts explosions and fires 

• adverse weather conditions 

• surface access restrictions 

• loss of title or other title related issues 

• lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof 

• compliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation including with respect to wastewater disposal discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing 

• unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressure or irregularities in formations and 

• costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials 

our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will depend on a number of factors including 

• the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of seismic data 

• the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects 

• the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled 

• economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews 

• our financial resources and results and 

• the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits 

these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or natural gas 

business disruptions from unexpected events including pandemics health crises and natural disasters may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including a public health crisis pandemic and epidemic war or civil unrest a terrorist act a cybersecurity incident resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information or causing data or 

table of contents 

systems to be unusable a weather event an earthquake or other catastrophe could cause instability in world financial markets and lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example the ongoing covid19 outbreak has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread including new strains of covid19 such as the delta and omicron variants the global availability and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the acceptance of such treatments and vaccines by a significant portion of the population and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus such as quarantines shelterinplace orders and business and government shutdowns whether through a continuation of existing measures or the reimposition of prior measures the worldwide vaccine rollouts in 2021 have allowed governments to ease covid19 restrictions and lockdown protocols however the recent increase in covid19 cases resulting from the delta and omicron variants has created questions about whether lockdown protocols must be adjusted and the ultimate impact of those variants is unknown we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to infection among our employees at our work sites and we continue to assess and plan for various operational contingencies related to covid19 however if a significant portion of our employees or contractors or the employees or contractors of the operators of pipelines processing and other facilities we utilize or of our vendors or suppliers were unable to work due to illness or if our field operations were suspended or temporarily restricted due to control measures designed to contain the outbreak that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we cannot guarantee that any precautionary actions taken by us will be effective in preventing disruptions to our business in the event of any significant resurgence in covid19 transmission and infection in the areas in which we operate our nonoperational employees may return to working remotely which could increase the risk of security breaches or other cyberincidents or attacks loss of data fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations via network infrastructure and internet services not arranged established or secured by us 

additionally vaccination and testing requirements related to covid19 could impact our business in the future in september 2021 the osha was directed to implement an emergency temporary standard requiring employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or to require unvaccinated workers to produce a negative covid19 test result on at least a weekly basis although the us supreme court recently blocked the implementation of the standard the future implementation of similar mandatory vaccination and testing requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the event that among other things a significant portion of our workforce does not choose to become vaccinated the costs related to mandatory testing for unvaccinated employees are significant or the time away from work for testing is disruptive to our operations 

furthermore the covid19 pandemic caused a significant reduction in demand for crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas and ngls during much of 2020 the supplydemand imbalance driven by the covid19 pandemic and production disagreements in march 2020 among members of opec led to a significant global economic contraction generally in 2020 and continued to have disruptive impacts on our industry in 2021 although an agreement to cut production was subsequently announced by opec the situation coupled with the impact of covid19 and storage and transportation capacity constraints resulted in a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry we cannot predict the full impact that covid19 and its variants or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business financial condition and results of operations at this time due to numerous uncertainties for example the operations of our midstream service providers on whom we rely for the transmission gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced oil natural gas and ngls may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing outbreaks andor the economic challenges may lead to a reduction in capacity or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our produced oil natural gas or ngls or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties although we have not received notices from our customers or counterparties regarding nonperformance issues or delays resulting from the covid19 pandemic to the extent we or any of our material suppliers or customers are unable to operate due to government restrictions or otherwise we may have to temporarily shut down or reduce production which could result in significant downtime and have significant adverse consequences for our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has impacted supply chains delaying deliveries of supplies and equipment and increasing costs our costs for services labor and supplies increased during 2021 due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic the ultimate impacts of the covid19 pandemic will depend on future developments including among others the ultimate severity of the virus any resurgence in covid19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience improvements the consequences of governmental and other measures the efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the success of vaccination programs the duration of the outbreak further actions taken by members of opec actions taken by governmental authorities customers suppliers and other third parties workforce availability and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as assumptions relating to commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline there could be a significant revision to the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties in the future 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

we estimate that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2021 will decrease at a rate of 24 percent 17 percent and 13 percent during 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively although production from our proved developed reserves is expected to increase during 2022 due to the effects of the merger partially offset by natural decline rates future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves that we have not currently classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline 

table of contents 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce oil natural gas and ngls in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 26 percent of our estimated proved reserves by volume were undeveloped these reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of 21 billion to convert our pud reserves into proved developed reserves developing pud reserves requires significant capital expenditures and the estimated future development costs associated with our pud reserves may not equal our actual costs development may not occur as scheduled and results of our development activities may not be as estimated if we choose not to develop our pud reserves or if we are not otherwise able to develop them successfully we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves in addition under the sec’s reserve reporting rules because pud reserves generally may be recorded only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking we may be required to remove any pud reserves that are no longer planned to be developed within this fiveyear time frame 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects depend on our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plans we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also consider our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2022 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically may come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2022 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

our ability to sell our oil natural gas and ngl production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our oil natural gas and ngl production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver the majority of our oil natural gas and ngl production through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons and in some cases the resulting curtailments of production could lead to payment being required where we fail to deliver oil natural gas and ngls to meet minimum volume commitments in addition construction of new pipelines and building of required infrastructure may be slow to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

moreover these availability and capacity issues are more likely to occur in remote areas with less established infrastructure such as our delaware basin properties where we have significant oil and natural gas production any of these availability or capacity issues whether resulting from the covid19 pandemic construction delays government restrictions adverse weather conditions such as the severe winter storm that impacted texas and oklahoma in february 2021 fire or other reasons could negatively affect our operations revenues and expenses in addition the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such an event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay to acquire them due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future commodity prices operating costs production taxes and 

table of contents 

potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to assess fully the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the businesses and properties we have acquired or may in the future acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the businesses and properties we have acquired including via the merger or may in the future acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

• the challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business 

• the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business 

• the challenge of inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies of the acquired business 

• potential unknown liabilities unforeseen expenses or higherthanexpected integration costs 

• an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated 

• potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties and 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations 

if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage our expanded business which may pose substantial challenges for management we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of our business there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our integration efforts 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

• well site blowouts cratering and explosions 

• equipment failures 

• pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release oil natural gas drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids 

• uncontrolled flows of oil natural gas or well fluids 

• pipeline ruptures 

• fires 

• formations with abnormal pressures 

• handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids 

• release of toxic gas 

table of contents 

• buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials 

• pollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or operators of our properties and 

• natural disasters 

any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution natural resource damages regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our utilization of oil and natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2021 nonoperated wells represented approximately 68 percent of our total owned gross wells or 18 percent of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties and on properties we operate in joint ventures in which we may share control with third parties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells or joint venture participant to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners including a joint venture participant for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions other operators may take when drilling completing or operating wells that they own 

many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling we have no control over offsetting operators who could take actions such as drilling and completing additional wells which could adversely affect our operations when a new well is completed and produced the pressure differential in the vicinity of the wellbore causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore and potentially away from existing wellbores which could cause a depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves the possibility for these impacts may increase with respect to wells that are shut in as a response to lower commodity prices or the lack of pipeline and storage capacity in addition completion operations and other activities conducted on other nearby wells could cause us in order to protect our existing wells to shut in production for indefinite periods of time shutting in our wells and damage to our wells from offset completions could result in increased costs and could adversely affect the reserves and recommenced production from such shut in wells 

we may lose leases if production is not established within the time periods specified in the leases or if we do not maintain production in paying quantities 

we could lose leases under certain circumstances if we do not maintain production in paying quantities or meet other lease requirements and the amounts we spent for those leases could be lost if we shut in wells in response to lower commodity prices or a lack of pipeline and storage capacity we may face claims that we are not complying with lease provisions in addition the biden administration also may impose new restrictions and regulations affecting our ability to drill conduct hydraulic fracturing operations and obtain necessary rightsofway on federal lands which could in turn result in the loss of federal leases the combined net acreage expiring over the next three years represents approximately one percent of our total net undeveloped acreage as of december 31 2021 our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified which could adversely affect our business 

cyberattacks targeting our systems the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure or the systems of our thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our business 

our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data computer networks and connected infrastructure including technologies that are managed by thirdparty providers on whom we rely to help us collect host or process information we depend on this technology to record and store financial data estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control 

table of contents 

nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the us which are necessary to transport our products to market computers also enable communications and provide a host of other support services for our business in recent years and in large part due to the covid19 pandemic we have increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services and technologies that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks including unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access and other cybersecurity related incidents 

cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software phishing ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption communication interruption or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations if our information technology systems cease to function properly or are breached we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations which may include drilling completion production and corporate functions a cyberattack involving our information systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production noncompliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties loss or disclosure of or damage to our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps 

in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may be costly and may not be sufficient as cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyberattacks furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

risks related to our indebtedness hedging activities and financial position 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects we rely on access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business financial condition and access to capital our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection in addition there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves which if successful could limit our ability to access capital markets for example in october 2020 jp morgan chase  co announced that it was adopting a financing commitment that is aligned to the goals of the paris climate accord of 2015 the “paris agreement” other banks have made climaterelated pledges for various causes such as stopping the financing of arctic drilling and coal companies these initiatives by activists and banks including certain banks who are parties to the credit agreement providing for our revolving credit facility could interfere with our business activities operations and ability to access capital future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 31 billion of debt outstanding with a principal amount of 29 billion and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future following the merger our legacy revolving credit facility and private placement senior notes remained outstanding in addition on october 7 2021 we completed an exchange offer whereby we issued 18 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes in exchange for 18 billion in aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding cimarex senior notes following completion of that exchange offer approximately 200 million in aggregate principal amount of cimarex senior notes remained outstanding the increase in our indebtedness as a result of the merger and related transactions could have adverse effects on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including by 

• requiring us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations returning free cash flow to stockholders and future business opportunities 

• increasing the risk of default on debt obligations 

• limiting our ability to sell assets engage in strategic transactions or obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debtservice obligations 

• increasing our exposure to a rise in interest rates which would generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges 

• depending on the levels of our outstanding debt limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes and 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions including declines in commodity prices economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control in addition our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the oil and gas industries could be impaired if we fail to make required payments or otherwise default on our debt the lenders who hold such debt also could accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of other debt 

in addition the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on 1 the credit rating of our debt at times when our debt has an investment grade credit rating and 2 our leverage ratio at times when our debt does not have an investment grade rating accordingly adverse changes in our leverage ratio or the credit rating of our debt may result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if commodity prices deteriorate from current levels it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial conditioncapital resources and liquidity” 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for oil and natural gas 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our oil and natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives 

table of contents 

available we generally utilize collar swap roll differential swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively in addition to mitigate a portion of its exposure to changes in commodity prices cimarex historically hedged oil and natural gas prices from time to time primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments upon completion of the merger we assumed cimarex’s existing hedges such that we will now bear the economic impact of those hedges 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

• there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production 

• production is less than expected or 

• a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations 

the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties although we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and implementing regulations thereunder our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

in addition the use of financial derivative instruments involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions we are unable to predict changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform and even if we could predict such changes accurately our ability to negate such risk may be limited depending on market conditions and the contractual terms of the instruments if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations under our financial derivative instruments such a default could 1 have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 2 result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes and 3 increase the likelihood that our financial derivative instruments may not achieve their intended strategic purposes 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives

esg concerns or negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our business operations and the price of our common stock 

businesses across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from investors stockholders and the public related to their esg practices failure or a perceived failure to adequately respond to or meet evolving investor stockholder or public esg expectations concerns and standards may cause a business entity to suffer reputational damage and materially and adversely affect the entity’s business financial condition andor stock price in addition organizations that provide esg information to investors have developed ratings processes for evaluating a business entity’s approach to esg matters although currently no universal rating standards exist the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and stockholders with some using these ratings to inform investment and voting decisions additionally certain investors use these scores to benchmark businesses against their peers and if a business entity is perceived as lagging these investors may engage with the entity to require improved esg disclosure or performance moreover certain members of the broader investment community may consider a business entitys sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision consequently a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investment funds engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors 

further negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change impacts of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions hydraulic fracturing oil

spills and pipeline explosions coupled with increasing societal expectations on businesses to address climate change and potential consumer use of substitutes to carbonintensive energy commodities may result in increased costs reduced demand for our oil natural gas and ngl production reduced profits increased regulation regulatory investigations and litigation and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets these factors could also cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be challenged withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

federal state and local laws and regulations judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling and environmental and safety laws and regulations which increase the cost of planning designing drilling installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs could increase our liability risks and could result in increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities which could have a material adverse effect on us and the oil and gas industry as a whole risk of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental and safety matters in particular including compliance issues environmental contamination and claims for damages to persons or property are inherent in oil and natural gas operations failure to comply with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action requirements and orders in addition applicable laws and regulations require us to obtain many permits for the operation of various facilities the issuance of required permits is not guaranteed and once issued permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in fines and penalties or require us to incur substantial costs to remedy violations 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected further state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity in recent years similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in march 2016 the us geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas these concerns have further increased regulatory scrutiny on hydraulic fracturing as well as oil and gas waste injection wells and led to the adoption of state and local laws regulating such activities we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing or oil and gas waste injection wells will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit these concerns also could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing in addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements two examples are the epa’s source aggregation rule and the epa’s new source performance standards “nsps” and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants “neshap” in june 2016 the epa published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry and as a result aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and timeconsuming air permitting and cause delays in our operations in august 2012 and june 2016 the epa published rules establishing new air emission control requirements for the oil and natural gas sector including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and to regulate methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry and neshap to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities although these rules were stayed and ultimately carved back by a september 2020 epa rule on june 30 2021 president biden signed into law a joint congressional resolution under the congressional review act disapproving the september 2020 rule on november 15 2021 the epa proposed rules to reduce methane emissions from both new and existing oil and natural gas 

table of contents 

industry sources compliance with the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and gas sector and any additional requirements imposed by new epa regulations particularly a new methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site which could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and adversely impact our business

oil and natural gas production operations especially those using hydraulic fracturing are substantially dependent on the availability of water our ability to produce oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner 

water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling process in particular we use a significant amount of water in the hydraulic fracturing process our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations could adversely impact our operations for water sourcing we first seek to use nonpotable water supplies for our operational needs in certain areas there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site an inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

for additional information please read “business and properties—other business matters—environmental and safety regulations—clean water act” in items 1 and 2 

the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas we produce 

studies have found that emission of certain gases commonly referred to as greenhouse gases “ghg” impact the earth’s climate the us congress and various states have been evaluating and in some cases implementing climaterelated legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of ghgs in the absence of significant federal ghg legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions through capandtrade programs which typically require major sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting ghgs on january 20 2021 his first day in office president biden signed an executive order on climate action and reconvened an interagency working group to establish social costs of three ghgs carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane carbon dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels including oil natural gas and ngls and methane is a primary component of natural gas the biden administration stated it will use updated social cost figures to inform federal regulations and major agency actions and to justify aggressive climate action as the us moves toward a “100 clean energy” economy with netzero ghg emissions these actions as well as any future laws or regulations that regulate or limit emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to both develop and implement new practices aimed at reducing ghg emissions such as emissions control technologies and monitor and report ghg emissions associated with our operations any of which could increase our operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and gas that we produce at this time it is not possible to quantify the impact of such future laws and regulations on our business

we are subject to various climaterelated risks 

the following is a summary of potential climaterelated risks that could adversely affect us 

transition risks transition risks are related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy and include policy and legal technology and market risks 

policy and legal risks policy risks include actions that seek to lessen activities that contribute to adverse effects of climate change or to promote adaptation to climate change these policy actions potentially could be accelerated with a 

table of contents 

democratic party in control of congress and the presidency examples of policy actions that would increase the costs of our operations or lower demand for our oil and gas include implementing carbonpricing mechanisms shifting energy use toward lower emission sources adopting energyefficiency solutions encouraging greater water efficiency measures and promoting more sustainable landuse practices policy actions also may include restrictions or bans on oil and gas activities which could lead to writedowns or impairments of our assets legal risks include potential lawsuits claiming failure to mitigate impacts of climate change failure to adapt to climate change and the insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks 

furthermore we also could also face an increased risk of climate‐related litigation or “greenwashing” suits with respect to our operations disclosures or products claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that ghg emissions from oil gas and ngl operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and state law private individuals or public entities also could attempt to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could seek personal injury and property damages or other remedies additionally governments and private parties are also increasingly filing suits or initiating regulatory action based on allegations that certain public statements regarding esgrelated matters by companies are false and misleading “greenwashing” campaigns that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes or that climaterelated disclosures made by companies are inadequate similar issues can also arise when aspirational statements such as netzero or carbon neutrality targets are made without clear plans although we are not a party to any such climaterelated or “greenwashing” litigation currently unfavorable rulings against us in any such case brought against us in the future could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 

technology risks technological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lowercarbon more energy efficient economic system may have a significant impact on us the development and use of emerging technologies in renewable energy battery storage and energy efficiency may lower demand for oil and gas resulting in lower prices and revenues and higher costs in addition many automobile manufacturers have announced plans to shift production from internal combustion engine to electric powered vehicles and states and foreign countries have announced bans on sales of internal combustion engine vehicles beginning as early as 2025 which would reduce demand for oil 

market risks markets could be affected by climate change through shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities especially carbonintensive commodities such as oil and gas and other products dependent on oil and gas lower demand for our oil and gas production could result in lower prices and lower revenues market risk also may take the form of limited access to capital as investors shift investments to less carbonintensive industries and alternative energy industries in addition investment advisers banks and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds recently have been promoting divestment of investments in fossil fuel companies and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction production and sale of oil and gas for additional information please read “—risks related to our indebtedness hedging activities and financial position—we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all” in this item 

reputation risk climate change is a potential source of reputational risk which is tied to changing customer or community perceptions of an organization’s contribution to or detraction from the transition to a lowercarbon economy for additional information please read “—esg concerns or negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our business operations and the price of our common stock” 

physical risks potential physical risks resulting from climate change may be event driven including increased severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes droughts or floods or may be driven by longerterm shifts in climate patterns that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves potential physical risks may cause direct damage to assets and indirect impacts such as supply chain disruption and also could include changes in water availability sourcing and quality which could impact drilling and completion operations these physical risks could cause increased costs production disruptions lower revenues and substantially increase the cost or limit the availability of insurance 

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws rules and directives collectively data protection laws relating to the processing of personal data 

the regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties a determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a 

table of contents 

violation of these laws additionally the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws 

tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers additional proposed general tax law changes include raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income further many states are currently in deficits and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue 

should the us or the states pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions our taxes would increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown we cannot predict the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business 

additional risks related to the merger 

the merger may result in a loss of customers distributors service providers suppliers vendors joint venture participants and other business counterparties and may result in the termination of existing contracts 

as a result of the merger some of our and cimarexs legacy customers distributors service providers suppliers vendors joint venture participants and other business counterparties may terminate or scale back their current or prospective business relationships with the combined business if relationships with customers distributors service providers suppliers vendors joint venture participants and other business counterparties are adversely affected by the merger our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the longterm success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our two businesses and operational synergies the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected may not be realized or could have other adverse effects that we do not currently foresee some of the assumptions that we have made such as the achievement of the anticipated benefits related to the geographic commodity and asset diversification and the expected size scale inventory and financial strength of the combined business may not be realized in addition there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the merger that could adversely impact us 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate for various reasons and may decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the merger 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and holders of our common stock could lose some or all of the value of their investment as a result of the merger we issued approximately 4082 million shares of our common stock to former cimarex stockholders excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards the merger agreement contained no restrictions on the ability of former cimarex stockholders or our historic stockholders to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of our common stock former cimarex stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they received in the merger and our historic stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the merger these sales of our common stock or the perception that these sales may occur could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock in addition with the completion of the merger our financial position is different from our financial position before the completion of the merger and our future results of operations and cash flows will be affected by factors different from those that previously affected our results of operations and cash flows all of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock furthermore the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which if they continue to occur could have a material adverse effect on the market for or liquidity of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 

our ability to utilize cimarexs historic net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited 

on october 1 2021 we completed the merger and as a result we acquired cimarex’s us federal net operating loss carryforwards “nols” and other tax attributes our ability to utilize these nols and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income depends on many factors including future income which cannot be assured section 382 of the internal 

table of contents 

revenue code of 1986 as amended section 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nols and other tax attributes that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an ownership change as determined under section 382 an ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who are each deemed to own at least 5 percent of such corporations stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling threeyear period 

as a result of the merger an ownership change occurred with respect to cimarex under section 382 which triggered a limitation on our ability to utilize cimarexs historic nols and other tax attributes and could cause some of those nols and other tax attributes to expire unutilized this annual limitation under section 382 is determined by multiplying 1 the fair market value of cimarexs stock at the time of the merger by 2 the longterm tax exempt rate published by the internal revenue service for the month in which the merger occurred subject to certain adjustments provided that any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years in addition the nols cimarex acquired in 2019 as part of its acquisition of resolute energy corporation are already subject to a section 382 limitation 

see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements “income taxes” included in item 8 for more information regarding cimarex’s historic nol carryforwards and the section 382 limitation 

risks related to our corporate structure 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage changeincontrol transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

• for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders 

• for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law 

• under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and 

• for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit 

this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders 

the exclusiveforum provision contained in our bylaws could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees 

our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the sole and exclusive forum for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us 2 any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director officer other employee or agent of coterra to coterra or our stockholders including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty 3 any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our bylaws or charter or 4 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an internal corporate claim shall to the fullest extent permitted by law be the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction the us federal district court for the district of delaware 

table of contents 

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law this exclusiveforum provision applies to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities act of 1933 as amended the “securities act” and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder this exclusiveforum provision may limit the ability of a stockholder to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find this exclusiveforum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition stockholders who do bring a claim in a state or federal court located within the state of delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near delaware in addition the court located in the state of delaware may reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders 

general risk factors 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations depend on a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the change in control and severance benefits triggered by the merger may provide incentive for key management and technical personnel to leave our company the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense and can be exacerbated following a downturn in which talented professionals leave the industry or when potential new entrants to the industry decide not to undertake the professional training to enter the industry this has occurred as a result of the downturn in commodity prices in 2020 and previous downturns and as a result of initiatives to move from oil and gas to alternative energy sources if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the cost of insurance may increase and the availability of insurance may decrease as a result of climate change or other factors 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense major and independent oil and natural gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties as well as for the capital equipment labor and infrastructure required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

further driven in part by reduced commodity prices related to the global covid19 pandemic certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings debt refinancing transactions management changes or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market this could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future we have seen and may continue to see corporate consolidations among our competitors which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry 

table of contents 

because our activity is concentrated in areas of heavy industry competition there is heightened demand for equipment power services facilities and resources resulting in higher costs than in other areas such intense competition also could result in delays in securing or the inability to secure the equipment power services resources or facilities necessary for our development activities which could negatively impact our production volumes in remote areas vendors also can charge higher rates due to the inability to attract employees to those areas and the vendors’ ability to deploy their resources in easiertoaccess areas 

the declaration payment and amounts of future dividends distributed to our stockholders will be uncertain 

although we have paid cash dividends on shares of common stock in the past our board of directors may determine not to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the amount of dividends paid in the future decisions on whether when and in which amounts to declare and pay any future dividends will remain in the discretion of our board of directors any dividend payment amounts will be determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis and it is possible that our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of dividends paid in the future or determine not to declare dividends in the future at any time and for any reason we expect that any such decisions will depend on our financial condition results of operations cash balances cash requirements future prospects the outlook for commodity prices and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant including but not limited to 

• whether we have enough cash to pay such dividends due to our cash requirements capital spending plans cash flows or financial position 

• our desire to maintain or improve the credit ratings on our debt and 

• applicable restrictions under delaware law 

our common stockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared

overview 

cimarex merger 

on october 1 2021 we and cimarex completed the merger cimarex is an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in texas new mexico and oklahoma under the terms of the merger agreement and subject to certain exceptions specified therein each eligible share of cimarex common stock was converted into the right to receive 40146 shares of our common stock as a result of the completion of the merger we issued approximately 4082 million shares of common stock to cimarex stockholders excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards additionally on october 1 2021 we changed our name to coterra energy inc 

certain financial and operational information set forth herein does not include the activity of cimarex for periods prior to the closing of the merger 

financial and operating overview 

financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 are as follows 

• natural gas production increased 534 bcf or six percent from 8577 bcf in 2020 to 9111 bcf in 2021 the slight increase was attributable to production during the fourth quarter of 2021 from properties acquired in the merger which significantly expanded our operations partially offset by the timing of our drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale in 2021 

• oil production increased 8 mmbbl from prior year the increase was attributable to production during the fourth quarter of 2021 from properties acquired in the merger 

• ngl production increased 7 mmbbl from prior year the increase was attributable to production during the fourth quarter of 2021 from properties acquired in the merger 

• average realized natural gas price for 2021 was 273 per mcf 63 percent higher than the 168 per mcf price realized in 2020 

• average realized oil and ngl prices for 2021 were 6035 and 3418 per bbl respectively 

• total capital expenditures were 725 million in 2021 compared to 570 million in 2020 the increase in capital expenditures was attributable to expanded drilling and completion activities during the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of the merger 

• drilled 114 gross wells 999 net with a success rate of 100 percent in 2021 compared to 74 gross wells 643 net with a success rate of 100 percent in 2020

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 outbreak has caused widespread illness and significant loss of life leading governments across the world to impose severely stringent limitations on movement and human interaction we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection among our employees and the communities in which we operate beginning in march 2020 we modified certain business practices including those related to nonoperational employee work locations and the cancellation of physical participation in a number of meetings events and conferences to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the centers for disease control and prevention the who and other governmental and regulatory authorities in addition we implemented and provided training on a covid19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols provided additional personal protective equipment to our workforce implemented rigorous covid19 selfassessment contact tracing and quarantine protocols increased cleaning protocols at all of our employee work locations and provided additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid19 cases we also collaborated and continue to collaborate with customers suppliers and service providers to minimize potential impacts to or disruptions of our operations and to implement longerterm emergency response protocols although we returned to full inperson working in our houston headquarters and other offices in july 2021 we intend to continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce our customers our suppliers our service providers and the communities in which we operate including any significant resurgence in covid19 transmission and infection should the need arise we will take such precautions as we believe are warranted 

our efforts to respond to the challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic as well as certain operational decisions we previously implemented such as our maintenance capital program have helped to minimize the impact and any resulting disruptions of the pandemic to our business and operations 

the longterm impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our business cash flows liquidity financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including among others the duration ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus and its variants such as the delta and omicron variants the global availability and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and boosters and the acceptance of such treatments and vaccines by a significant portion of the population any significant resurgence in virus transmission and infection in regions that have experienced improvements the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus whether through a continuation of existing measures or the reimposition of prior measures and other actions by governmental authorities customers suppliers and other third parties 

market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials weather conditions and other factors our realized prices are also further impacted by our hedging activities 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices particularly oil and natural gas prices material declines in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition liquidity and ability to obtain financing lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically in addition in periods of low commodity prices we may elect to curtail a portion of our production from time to time historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices sometimes fluctuating widely and they may remain volatile as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues in addition to commodity prices and production volumes finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “results of 

operations — impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “derivative instruments” for more information 

one of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic was a significant reduction in demand for crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas the supplydemand imbalance driven by the covid19 pandemic and production disagreements in march 2020 among members of opec led to a significant global economic contraction generally in 2020 and continued to have disruptive impacts on the oil and gas industry in 2021 although the members of opec agreed in april 2020 to cut oil production and have subsequently taken actions that generally have supported commodity prices and us production has declined oil prices and natural gas prices remained low relative to prepandemic levels through the first quarter of 2021 as the oversupply and lack of demand in the market persisted oil natural gas and ngl prices increased during the second half of 2021 compared to 2020 in part due to greater demand and slightly decreasing production levels in addition our costs for services labor and supplies increased during 2021 due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic 

meanwhile nymex oil and natural gas futures prices have strengthened since the reduction of pandemicrelated restrictions and recent opec cooperation improving oil and natural gas futures prices in part reflect market expectations of limited us supply growth from publicly traded companies as a result of capital investment discipline and a focus on delivering free cash flow returns to stockholders in addition natural gas prices have benefited from strong worldwide liquefied natural gas “lng” demand and sustained higher us exports lower associated gas growth from oil drilling and improved us economic activity oil price futures have improved coinciding with recovering global economic activity lower supply from major oil producing countries opec cooperation and moderating inventory levels 

although the current outlook on oil and natural gas prices is generally favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the shortterm in the event further disruptions occur and continue for an extended period of time our operations could be adversely impacted commodity prices could decline and our costs may increase further although we are unable to predict future commodity prices at current oil natural gas and ngl price levels we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels our management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 

for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues refer to “results of operations” below 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

we strive to maintain an adequate liquidity level to address commodity price volatility and risk our primary sources of liquidity are 1 cash on hand 2 net cash provided by operating activities and 3 available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 

our liquidity requirements consist primarily of 1 capital expenditures 2 payment of contractual obligations including debt maturity and interest payments 3 working capital requirements 4 dividend payments and 5 share repurchases see below for additional discussion and analysis of our cash flows we believe that with operating cash flow cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the ability to finance our spending plans over the next twelve months and based on current expectations for the long term 

we had 15 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2021 the revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in april 2024 subject to extension up to one year if certain conditions are met 

at december 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility we also had unrestricted cash on hand of 10 billion as of december 31 2021 

our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our borrowing capacity based on our leverage ratio refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “debt and credit agreements” for further details regarding our leverage ratio 

immediately prior to the merger cimarex had outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of 20 billion on october 7 2021 and after the completion of the merger we completed private offers to eligible holders to exchange 18 billion in aggregate principal of cimarex senior notes the “existing cimarex notes” for 18 billion in aggregate principal of new notes issued by us the “new coterra notes” and 2 million of cash consideration in connection with the debt exchange cimarex obtained consents to adopt certain amendments to each of the indentures governing the existing cimarex notes to eliminate certain of the covenants restrictive provisions and events of default from such indentures the new coterra notes are 

table of contents 

general unsecured senior obligations of ours and have substantially identical terms and covenants to the existing cimarex notes before giving effect to the amendments referred to in the immediately preceding sentence which we believe are customary for senior unsecured notes issued by companies of similar size and credit quality as compared to us the new coterra notes consist of 706 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due 2024 687 million aggregate principal amount of 390 senior notes due 2027 and 433 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due 2029 

our debt is currently rated as investment grade by the three leading rating agencies in determining our debt ratings the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including but not limited to current commodity prices our liquidity position our asset quality and reserve mix debt levels cost structure and growth plans credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency there are no “rating triggers” in any of our debt agreements that would accelerate the scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a certain level however a change in our debt rating could impact our interest rate on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our ability to economically access debt markets in the future and could trigger the requirement to post credit support under various agreements which could reduce the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 

at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “debt and credit agreements” for further details regarding financial covenants 

as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions liquidity position and other factors we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases andor exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows 

operating activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices production volumes and operating expenses commodity prices have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply and demand for oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure constraints basis differentials inventory storage levels seasonal influences and other factors in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures 

on october 1 2021 we and cimarex completed the merger although we expect to achieve certain general and administrative expense synergies over the longterm through cost savings in the nearterm we will incur certain mergerrelated restructuring cost cash outflows ranging from 100 million to 110 million these payments will primarily relate to workforce reductions and the associated employee severance benefits and the acceleration of employee benefits that were triggered by the merger 

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility repayments of debt the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively payment of dividends repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had a working capital surplus of 916 million and 26 million respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next 12 months 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 increased by 889 million compared to 2020 this increase was primarily due to higher natural gas oil and ngl revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses higher cash paid on derivative settlements and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in natural gas 

table of contents 

oil and ngl revenue was primarily due to the merger an increase in realized natural gas prices and moderately higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale average realized natural gas prices increased by 87 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 

refer to “results of operations” for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 897 million from 2020 compared to 2021 the decrease was primarily driven by 10 billion of cash acquired as a result of the merger partially offset by 152 million of higher capital expenditures which were primarily a result of the merger 

financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased by 830 million from 2020 compared to 2021 the increase was due to 621 million of higher dividend payments related to special and variable common stock dividends paid in 2021 101 million higher net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes and 104 million higher tax withholding payments related to sharebased awards that vested as a result of the merger 

2020 and 2019 compared for information on the comparison of operating investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 refer to financial condition cash flows included in the coterra energy inc formerly cabot oil  gas corporation annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

1 includes 188 million of current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

2 includes consideration of 91 billion related to the issuance of our common stock in connection with the merger 

on september 29 2021 our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 960000000 shares to 1800000000 shares that amendment became effective on october 1 2021 

on october 1 2021 and following the effectiveness of the merger we issued approximately 4082 million shares of common stock to cimarex stockholders under the terms of the merger agreement excluding shares that were awarded in replacement of previously outstanding cimarex restricted share awards 

share repurchases we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2021 and 2020 under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2021 125067 shares of common stock went into treasury stock that were retained from restricted stock award vestings for the withholding of taxes 

in february 2022 our board of directors terminated our previously authorized share repurchase program and authorized a new share repurchase program this new share repurchase program authorizes the company to purchase up to 125 billion of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions 

dividends during 2021 and 2020 we paid dividends of 780 million 112 per share and 159 million 040 per share on our common stock respectively 

in april 2021 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 010 per share to 011 per share in november 2021 our board of directors also approved an increase in the base component of our quarterly dividend on our common stock from 011 per share to 0125 per share also on that date related to our dividend 

table of contents 

strategy to return at least 50 percent of quarterly free cash flows to stockholders our board of directors approved a variable dividend of 0175 per share resulting in a total baseplusvariable dividend of 030 per share on our common stock 

on october 4 2021 and in connection with the completion of the merger our board of directors approved a special dividend of 050 per share payable on our common stock on october 22 2021 

in february 2022 our board of approved an additional increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 0125 per share to 015 per share also on that date our board of directors approved a variable dividend of 041 per share resulting in a quarterly baseplusvariable dividend of 056 per share on our common stock 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



 

1 these amounts represent the fair value of the proved and unproved properties recorded in the purchase price allocation with respect to the merger the purchase was funded through the issuance of our common stock 

2 exploration expenditures include 4 million and 2 million of exploratory dryhole costs in 2020 and 2019 respectively there were no exploratory dryhole costs in 2021 

in 2021 we drilled 114 gross wells 999 net and completed 132 gross wells 1083 net of which 14 gross wells 130 net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years 

our 2022 capital program is expected to be approximately 1400 million to 1500 million of which 1225 million to 1325 million is allocated to drilling and completion activities we expect to turninline 134 to 153 total net wells in 2022 across our three operating regions approximately 49 percent of drilling and completion capital will be invested in the permian basin 44 percent in the marcellus shale and the balance in the anadarko basin midstream saltwater disposal electrification infrastructure and other investments are expected to total approximately 175 million in the year we will continue to assess the commodity price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations as of december 31 2021 our material contractual obligations include debt and related interest expense transportation and gathering agreements lease obligations operational agreements drilling and completion obligations derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations other joint owners in the properties operated by us could incur a portion of these costs we expect that our sources of capital will be 

table of contents 

adequate to fund these obligations refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report for further details 

from time to time we enter into arrangements that can give rise to material offbalance sheet obligations as of december 31 2021 the material offbalance sheet arrangements we had entered into included certain firm transportation and processing commitments and operating lease agreements with terms at commencement of less than 12 months for equipment used in our exploration and development activities we have no other offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing financial statements we follow gaap these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates and changes in our estimates are recorded when known we consider the following to be our most critical estimates that involve judgement of management 

purchase accounting 

from time to time we may acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations such as the merger in connection with the merger we allocated the 91 billion of purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the effective date of the merger the purchase price allocation is substantially complete however it may be subject to change for up to one year after october 1 2021 the effective date of the merger 

we made a number of assumptions in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger the most significant assumptions related to the fair value estimates of proved and unproved oil and gas properties which were recorded at a fair value of 129 billion since sufficient market data was not available regarding the fair values of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties we prepared our estimates using discounted cash flows and engaged third party valuation experts significant judgments and assumptions are inherent in these estimates and include among other things estimates of reserve quantities and production volumes future commodity prices and price differentials expected development costs lease operating costs reserve risk adjustment factors and an estimate of an applicable market participant discount rate that reflects the risk of the underlying cash flow estimates 

estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant impact on future results of operations as presented in our financial statements fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices and price differentials reserve quantities and production volumes development costs and lease operating costs in the event that future commodity prices or reserve quantities or production volumes are significantly lower than those used in the determination of fair value as of the effective date of the merger the likelihood increases that certain costs may be determined to be unrecoverable 

in addition to the fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties other significant fair value assessments for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger relate to longterm debt fixed assets and derivative instruments the fair value of the assumed cimarex publicly traded debt was based on available thirdparty quoted prices we prepared estimates and engaged thirdparty valuation experts to assist in the valuation of certain fixed assets which required significant judgments and assumptions inherent in the estimates and included projected cash flows and comparable companies’ cash flow multiples the fair value of assumed derivative instrument liabilities included significant judgments and assumptions related to estimates of future commodity prices and related differentials and estimates of volatility factors and interest rates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which ultimately will determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dryhole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions 

table of contents 

include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

the reserve quantity estimates of our oil and gas properties have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff miller and lents has audited 100 percent of the proved reserves estimates related to our marcellus shale properties and degolyer and macnaughton has performed an independent evaluation of estimated net reserves representing greater than 80 percent of the total future net revenue discounted at 10 percent attributable to the proved reserves estimates related to our permian basin anadarko basin and other properties excluding our marcellus shale properties each of miller and lents and degolyer and macnaughton concluded in their opinions that our presented estimates are reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 029 per boe and an increase of 032 per boe respectively on our dda rate this estimated impact is based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis we cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that we believe will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline we would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying oil and natural gas 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

derivative instruments 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward commodity prices basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 

contingency reserves 

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases our judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use various models including both a black scholes or a monte carlo valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors

our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities refer to the “other business matters” section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants 

our ability to incur debt incur liens pay dividends repurchase or redeem our equity interests redeem our senior notes make certain types of investments enter into mergers sell assets enter into transactions with affiliates and engage in certain other activities are subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments in addition the senior note agreements governing various series of senior notes that were issued in separate private placements the “private placement senior notes” require us to maintain a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and require a maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters of not more than 30 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 30 to 10 until such time as we have no other debt outstanding that has a financial maintenance covenant based on a leverage ratio and thereafter requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 percent 

at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage 

our business involves a variety of operating risks refer to “risk factors—business and operational risks—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in part i item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these hazards and risks and related losses the occurrence of any loss events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activitie s 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices significant declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants 

the majority of our production is sold at marketsensitive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however we may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives including collars swaps roll differential swaps and basis swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under these arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions

results of operations 

2021 and 2020 compared 

operating revenues 



production revenues 

our production revenues vary from year to year and are derived from sales of our oil natural gas and ngl production our 2021 production revenues were substantially increased due to the merger which significantly expanded our operations to include the permian and anadarko basins increases or decreases in our revenues profitability and future production growth are highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive commodity prices are market driven and we expect future prices to be volatile due to supply and demand factors pipeline capacity seasonality and geopolitical economic and other factors 

below is a discussion of our production revenue price and volume variances 

natural gas revenues 



natural gas revenues increased 14 billion primarily due to significantly higher natural gas prices combined with higher production the increase in production was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter production due to the merger 

oil revenues 

oil revenues increased 616 million primarily due to the merger 

ngl revenues 

ngl revenues increased 243 million primarily due to the merger 

loss gain on derivative instruments 

net gains and losses on our derivative instruments are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity index prices as compared to the contracted prices and the monthly cash settlements if any of the instruments we have elected not to designate our derivatives as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and therefore we do not apply hedge accounting treatment to our derivative instruments consequently changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments and cash settlements on the instruments are included as a component of operating revenues as either a net gain or loss on derivative instruments cash settlements of our contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in our statements of cash flows the following table presents the components of “loss gain on derivative instruments” for the years indicated 

table of contents 



included in the table above are settlement losses of 194 million related to the derivative liabilities that we assumed in the merger settlement losses realized in 2021 were primarily driven by significant price increases in the underlying commodity index prices that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 

operating costs and expenses 

costs associated with producing oil and natural gas are substantial among other factors some of these costs vary with commodity prices some trend with the volume and commodity mix of production some are a function of the number of wells we own some depend on the prices charged by service companies and some fluctuate based on a combination of the foregoing our operating costs and expenses in 2021 were substantially increased due to the merger which significantly expanded our operations to include the permian and anadarko basins in addition our costs for services labor and supplies have recently increased due to increased demand for those items and supply chain disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic 

the following table reflects our operating costs and expenses for the years indicated and a discussion of the operating costs and expenses follows 

 direct operations 

direct operations expense generally consists of costs for labor equipment maintenance saltwater disposal compression power treating and miscellaneous other costs lease operating expense direct operations expense also includes well workover activity necessary to maintain production from existing wells direct operations expense consisted of lease operating expense and workover expense as follows 



lease operating and workover expense increased due to our expanded operations due to the merger 

table of contents 

transportation processing and gathering 

transportation processing and gathering costs principally consist of expenditures to prepare and transport production from the wellhead including gathering fuel compression and processing costs gathering costs also include costs associated with operating our gas gathering infrastructure including operating and maintenance expenses costs vary by operating area and will fluctuate with increases or decreases in production volumes contractual fees and changes in fuel and compression costs 

transportation processing and gathering increased 92 million due to our expanded operations due to the merger offset by a decrease in costs due to lower production in the marcellus shale 

taxes other than income 

taxes other than income consist of production or severance taxes drilling impact fees ad valorem taxes and other taxes state and local taxing authorities assess these taxes with production taxes being based on the volume or value of production drilling impact fees being based on drilling activities and prevailing natural gas prices and ad valorem taxes being based on the value of properties the following table presents taxes other than income for the years indicated 

taxes other than income increased 69 million production taxes represented the majority of our taxes other than income which increased primarily due to the merger and higher commodity prices drilling impact fees increased primarily due to higher natural gas prices 

depreciation depletion and amortization 

dda expense consisted of the following for the periods indicated 



depletion of our producing properties is computed on a field basis using the unitsofproduction method under the successful efforts method of accounting the economic life of each producing property depends upon the estimated proved reserves for that property which in turn depend upon the assumed realized sales price for future production therefore fluctuations in oil and gas prices will impact the level of proved developed and proved reserves used in the calculation higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves which reduces depletion expense conversely lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves which increases depletion expense the cost of replacing production also impacts our depletion expense in addition changes in estimates of reserve quantities estimates of operating and future development costs reclassifications of properties from unproved to proved and impairments of oil and gas properties will also impact depletion expense our depletion expense increased 290 million due to increased production and a higher depletion rate of 397 per mboe for 2021 both of which are attributable to a significant increase in the value of the oil and gas properties acquired on the closing date of the merger compared to 261 per mboe for 2020 

table of contents 

fixed assets consist primarily of gas gathering facilities water infrastructure buildings vehicles aircraft furniture and fixtures and computer equipment and software these items are recorded at cost and are depreciated on the straightline method based on expected lives of the individual assets which range from three to 30 years also included in our depreciation expense is the depreciation of the rightofuse asset associated with our finance lease gathering system the increase in depreciation expense during 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily due to increased depreciation on our gathering and plant facilities acquired in the merger 

general and administrative 

general and administrative “ga” expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits stockbased compensation office rent legal and consulting fees systems costs and other administrative costs incurred our ga expense is reported net of amounts reimbursed to us by working interest owners of the oil and gas properties we operate the table below reflects our ga expense 



general and administrative increased 44 million primarily due to the merger which significantly expanded our headcount and officerelated expenses 

periodic stockbased compensation expense will fluctuate based on the grant date fair value of awards the number of awards the requisite service period of the awards estimated employee forfeitures and the timing of the awards stockbased compensation expense increased primarily due to the acceleration of vesting of certain stockbased awards on closing of the merger of 10 million and an increase in compensation expense of 9 million related to replacement awards granted to cimarex employees at the closing of the merger these increases were partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense of 4 million related to the awards that vested at the closing of the merger 

mergerrelated expenses increased 106 million primarily due to 42 million of transactionrelated costs legal and financial advisor costs associated with the merger 20 million of deferred compensation expense related to certain changeincontrol payments and 44 million associated with the expected termination of certain cimarex employees which is being accrued over the expected transition period 

other expenses and income 

interest expense net 

interest expense increased 8 million primarily due to the incremental interest expense net of premium amortization associated with the debt related to the merger of 22 billion including the new coterra notes and existing cimarex notes this increase was partially offset by lower interest expense due to repayment of 87 million of our 651 weightedaverage private placement senior notes which matured in july 2020 the repayment of 88 million of our 558 weightedaverage private placement senior notes which matured in january 2021 and the repayment of 100 million of our 365 weightedaverage private placement senior notes which matured in september 2021

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 303 million due to higher pretax income attributable to increased commodity prices and the merger

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are subject to a variety of risks including market risks associated with changes in commodity prices and interest rate movements on outstanding debt the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we were party to as of december 31 2021 and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in commodity prices or interest rates 

commodity price risk 

our most significant market risk exposure is pricing applicable to our oil natural gas and ngl production realized prices are mainly driven by the worldwide price for oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas and ngl production these prices have been volatile and unpredictable to mitigate the volatility in commodity prices we may enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our production 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of commodity price volatility for our production in the oil and natural gas markets through the use of financial commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our financial commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and while protecting us in the event of price declines limit the benefit to us in the event of price increases further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our financial commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements “derivative instruments” for a more detailed discussion of our derivatives 

periodically we enter into financial commodity derivatives including collar swap roll differential swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to commodity price declines related to our oil and natural gas production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into financial commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our financial derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index 

table of contents 

as of december 31 2021 we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 

  

1 the index price the company pays under these basis swaps is wti midland as quoted by argus americas crude 



 

1 the index price for these collars is el paso natural gas company permian basin index “perm ep” as quoted in platt’s inside ferc

3 the index price for these collars is waha west texas natural gas index “waha” as quoted in platt’s inside ferc 

the estimated fair value amounts set forth in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2021 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing 

table of contents 

credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative contracts while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by several of our banks 

in early 2022 we entered into the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 

a significant portion of our expected oil and natural gas production for 2022 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in commodity prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2021 oil collars with floor prices ranging from 2900 to 4000 per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 3415 to 5110 per bbl covered 37 mmbbls or 45 percent of oil production at a weightedaverage price of 4437 per bbl oil basis swaps covered 32 mmbbls or 40 percent of oil production at a weightedaverage price of 008 per bbl oil roll differential swaps covered 16 mmbbls or 20 percent of oil production at a weightedaverage price of 010 per bbl 

during 2021 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 150 to 285 per mmbtu and ceiling prices ranging from 175 to 394 per mmbtu covered 1932 bcf or 21 percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 285 per mmbtu natural gas swaps covered 563 bcf or six percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 316 per mmbtu 

we are exposed to market risk on financial commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of oil and natural gas however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of oil and natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2021 we had total debt of 31 billion with a principal amount of 29 billion all of our outstanding debt is based on fixed interest rates and as a result we do not have significant exposure to movements in market interest rates with respect to such debt our revolving credit facility provides for variable interest rate borrowings however we did not have any borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2021 and therefore no related exposure to interest rate risk 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

the fair value of the new coterra notes and existing cimarex notes is based on quoted market prices we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of our private placement senior notes the fair value of the private placement senior notes is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of the private placement senior notes is based on interest rates currently available to us

part iv 




 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration and production of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value through the commodity price cycles by maintaining our disciplined approach to returnsfocused capital allocation while we operate in a cyclical industry driven by the volatility of commodity prices we believe that focusing on the following key components of our business strategy positions us to succeed on creating shareholder value through the commodity price cycles 

focus on financial returns our goal is to generate financial returns that exceed our cost of capital by focusing on disciplined capital investment and maintaining a low cost structure in 2020 our return on capital employed nongaap was 76 percent a decrease from 222 percent in 2019 the decrease was driven by significantly lower natural gas prices in 2020 compared to 2019 commodity prices play a critical role in our capital allocation decisions and have a significant impact on our financial returns 

demonstrate continued cost control underpinning our financial returns is our continued focus on cost control which resulted in a slight reduction of one percent in operating expenses per unit in 2020 relative to 2019 we believe maintaining a low cost structure provides us with a competitive advantage especially in a low natural gas price environment we will continue to assess additional opportunities to reduce our operating expenses per unit over time 

maintain financial strength we believe that maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility is imperative in a cyclical industry that is exposed to commodity price volatility in recent years we have reduced our absolute debt levels and we anticipate retiring the current portion of our debt at maturity in 2021 additionally we ended 2020 with strong liquidity resulting from 1401 million of cash and cash equivalents and 15 billion of unused commitments on our revolving credit facility 

generate positive free cash flow we believe generating positive free cash flow is paramount to creating shareholder value our disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us to adjust our capital spending and activity levels in response to commodity prices in order to maximize positive free cash flow through the price cycles our free cash flow is used for returning capital to shareholders reducing debt levels and enhancing liquidity in 2020 we generated 7782 million in cash flow from operations gaap and 1091 million of free cash flow nongaap representing our fifth consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation 

return capital to shareholders we plan to continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders through all commodity price cycles in 2020 we returned 1594 million of capital to shareholders representing 146 percent of our free cash flow for the year we have increased our dividend five times since 2017 and since reinstating our share repurchase program in 2017 we have reduced our shares outstanding by over 14 percent in february 2021 we announced an updated capital return framework we intend to implement a base plus supplemental dividend approach under this updated capital return framework we plan to continue to deliver our regular quarterly base dividend and to supplement our regular quarterly base dividends with an annual supplemental dividend to return capital equal to a minimum of 50 percent of annual free cash flow any excess free cash flow above 50 percent of annual free cash flow is expected to be utilized for balance sheet enhancement additional supplemental dividends or opportunistic share repurchases depending on market conditions 

increase our proved reserve base in 2020 we increased our yearend proved reserves by six percent at an allsources finding and development cost nongaap of 035 per mcfe we also replaced 190 percent of our production for the year we intend to continue to increase our proved reserves through our disciplined investment in the development of our marcellus shale asset assuming the commodity price environment provides for economic returns for our shareholders 

focus on safe responsible and sustainable operations we believe that safe responsible and sustainable operations are important tenants of our overall business strategy our safety programs are built on a foundation that emphasizes personal responsibility and safety leadership while our operational focus is based on making our operations more environmentally and socially sustainable by actively implementing technology across our operations from design phase to equipment improvements to limit and reduce our methane emissions in addition we focus on practical and sustainable environmental initiatives that 

promote efficient use of water and protect water quality eliminate releases and minimize land surface impact because we are a producer of 100 percent natural gas we believe we have a competitive advantage as it relates to the production of clean energy and our overall carbon footprint on the environment 

refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  nongaap financial measures for a discussion and calculation of return on capital employed free cash flow and finding and development cost which are nongaap financial measures 

2021 outlook 

our 2021 capital program is expected to be approximately 5300 million to 5400 million representing a six percent reduction at the midpoint of the range from our 2020 capital program of 5698 million we reduced our planned capital expenditures which contemplates a maintenance capital program as a result of the weaker natural gas price environment we expect to fund these expenditures with our operating cash flow and if required cash on hand 

in 2021 our capital program will focus on the marcellus shale where we expect to drill and complete 80 net wells we allocate our planned program for capital expenditures based on market conditions return on capital and free cash flow expectations and availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may adjust our capital expenditures accordingly 

description of properties 

our operations are primarily concentrated in one unconventional play—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania our marcellus shale properties represent our primary operating area and are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 175000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2020 net production in the marcellus shale was 857 bcfe representing substantially all of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2020 we had a total of 8659 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 995 percent are operated by us 

during 2020 we invested 5621 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 643 net wells completed 773 net wells and turned in line 692 net wells as of december 31 2020 we had 130 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2020 with three drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2021 with two rigs operating 

divestitures 

in july 2018 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the haynesville shale to a third party for 300 million and recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of 297 million 

in february 2018 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale to an affiliate of venado oil  gas llc for 7650 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 4143 million associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 454 million 

in september 2017 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio to an affiliate of carbon natural gas company for 413 million during the second quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 686 million associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing the sale in the third quarter of 2017 we recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 119 million 

in february 2016 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 564 million and recognized a 05 million gain on sale of assets 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts and is subject to seasonal price swings the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states where we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies gas marketers and power generation facilities 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

delivery commitments 

we have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell natural gas we believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of our commitments but may be required to purchase natural gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur 

a summary of our firm sales commitments as of december 31 2020 are set forth in the table below 



we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas under the majority of these firm sales contracts and have entered into numerous agreements for transportation of our production some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms however we do not believe we have a financial commitment due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations 

risk management 

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2020 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 190 to 215 per mmbtu and ceiling prices ranging from 210 to 238 per mmbtu covered 923 bcf or 11 percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 209 per mmbtu natural gas swaps covered 535 bcf or six percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 224 per mmbtu 

as of december 31 2020 we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 



in early 2021 the company entered into the following financial commodity derivatives 



a significant portion of our expected natural gas production for 2021 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



 

1 proved undeveloped reserves for 2020 2019 and 2018 include reserves drilled but uncompleted of 2410 bcfe 7832 bcfe and 6316 bcfe respectively 

2 there were no significant ngl reserves for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

3 natural gas equivalents are determined using a ratio of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or ngls 

4 reserve life index is equal to yearend proved reserves divided by annual production for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

our proved reserves at december 31 2020 increased 769 bcfe or six percent from 12903 bcfe at december 31 2019 in 2020 we added 1974 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the results from our drilling and completion program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net downward revision of 347 bcfe which was primarily due to a net downward performance revision of 245 bcfe and a downward revision of 66 bcfe associated with proved undeveloped pud reserves reclassifications as a result of the fiveyear limitation the net downward performance revision of 245 bcfe was primarily due to a downward performance revision of 368 bcfe related to certain proved developed producing properties partially offset by an upward revision of 123 bcfe associated with our pud reserves due to performance revisions and the drilling of longer lateral length wells during 2020 we produced 858 bcfe 

since substantially all of our reserves are natural gas our reserves are significantly more sensitive to natural gas prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factors—business and operational risks—our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our senior vice president ehs and engineering is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of two engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by miller and lents he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 38 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 29 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management 

miller and lents has audited 100 percent of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient quality 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 27 2021 has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not retained on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2020 we had 5064 bcfe of pud reserves associated with future development costs of 14 billion which represents an increase of 217 bcfe compared to december 31 2019 all of our pud reserves are located in susquehanna county pennsylvania we expect to complete substantially all of our pud reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of 2021 future development plans are reflective of the lower commodity price environment and have been established based on expected available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 all pud reserves are expected to be drilled and completed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 

• transfer of 1785 bcfe from pud to proved developed reserves based on total capital expenditures of 4555 million during 2020 

• new pud reserve additions of 1945 bcfe in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania and 

• upward pud reserve revisions of 57 bcfe resulting from upward performance revisions of 123 bcfe associated with performance revisions along with the drilling of longer lateral wells partially offset by downward revisions of 66 bcfe associated with pud reclassifications as a result of the fiveyear limitation 

production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent substantially all of our total company historical operational information and proved reserves are derived from our dimock field in northeast pennsylvania 



 

1 there was no significant ngl production for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 and less than one percent of our equivalent production for the year ended december 31 2018 ngl production represented 85 percent of our crude oil production for the year ended december 31 2018 

acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2020 



 

1 includes leasehold and mineral fee net acreage of 588154 and 150033 respectively associated with deep formations located in west virginia and virginia substantially all of this leasehold is held by production from shallower formations that are operated by others 

total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2020 is 13515 3947 and 4371 for the years ending december 31 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 32 percent of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our primary operating area where we currently expect to continue drilling and completion activities andor extend lease terms there were no pud reserves recorded on any of our expiring acreage outside of our primary operating area 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2020 this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



 

1 total percentage of gross operated wells is 906 percent 

drilling activity 

we drilled and completed wells or participated in the drilling and completion of wells as indicated in the table below the information below should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value 



during the year ended december 31 2020 we completed 26 gross wells 260 net that w ere drilled in prior years 

the following table sets forth information about wells for which drilling was in progress or which were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2020 which are not included in the above table 



other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our concentrated acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the year ended december 31 2020 three customers accounted for approximately 21 percent 16 percent and 12 percent of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2019 three customers accounted for approximately 17 percent 16 percent and 16 percent of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2018 two customers accounted for approximately 20 percent and 11 percent of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is 

to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and ngpa and the ferc’s regulations thereunder up to 10 million per day per violation this maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation the current maximum penalty is over 13 million per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to ferc jurisdiction however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rule makings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of the ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions 

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap 

transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum 

sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 percent should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 the ferc recently concluded its fiveyear index review to establish the new adder for crude oil and liquids pipeline rates subject to indexing the ferc issued an order on december 17 2020 establishing an index level of producer price index for finished goods plus 078 percent for the fiveyear period commencing july 1 2021 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or any potential future challenges to pipelines rates 

environmental and safety regulations 

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and to safety matters permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment those regulating the emission of air contaminants and laws and regulations otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or to occupational health and safety 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and 

gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes as well as wastes that are exempt from such regulation the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess the need to regulate exploration and production related oil and gas wastes exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra under subtitle d applicable to nonhazardous solid waste the consent decree required the epa to propose a rulemaking by march 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary in april 2019 the epa issued its determination that based on its review including consideration of state regulatory programs it was not necessary at the time to revise subtitle d regulations to address the management of oil and gas wastes in the future we could be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than we encounter today 

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and implementing regulations which are primarily executed through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies 

generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with applicable emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements two examples are the epa’s source aggregation rule and the epa’s new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap in june 2016 the epa published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry and as a result aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and timeconsuming air permitting particularly with respect to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in operations 

in 2012 the epa published final nsps and neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap for the oil and natural gas sector in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updated and expanded the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns in september 2020 the epa published a final rule amending the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and natural gas sector that removed transmission and storage sources from the oil and natural gas industry source category and rescinded the methane requirements applicable to the production and processing sources the same day as the publication of the september 2020 rule 20 states and three municipalities filed a petition for review of the epa’s final rule in the dc circuit court of appeals in october 2020 the dc circuit court of appeals denied emergency motions for a stay of the oil and natural gas sector nsps amendments from taking effect pending review the original petitioners have been joined by a number of environmental groups in challenging the september 2020 rule for additional information please read “risk factors—legal regulatory and governmental risks— federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows” in item 1a 

in october 2015 the epa adopted a lower national ambient air quality standard for ozone the revised standard resulted in additional areas being designated as ozone nonattainment which could lead to requirements for additional emissions control equipment and the imposition of more stringent permit requirements on facilities in those areas the epa completed its final area designations under the new ozone standard in july 2018 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells in 

addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factors—legal regulatory and governmental risks—federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered but not enacted legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes potential regulation of methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read “risk factors—legal regulatory and governmental risks—climate change and climate change legislative and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce” in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community right‑to‑know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety 

human capital resources 

we believe that our ability to attract retain and develop the highest quality personnel is an important component of our success we believe our employee levels are appropriate and that we have the human capital to operate our business and carry out our strategy as determined by management and our board of directors as of december 31 2020 we had 503 employees 274 of whom were associated with our upstream operations of which 92 were located at our corporate headquarters in houston texas 88 were located at our regional office in pittsburgh pennsylvania and 94 were located in our field operations in susquehanna county pennsylvania of these 274 upstream employees 214 were salaried and 60 were hourly in addition to our upstream employees we had 229 employees that are employed by our wholly owned subsidiary gassearch drilling services corporation gds which is a service company engaged in water hauling and site preparation exclusively for our field operations of these 229 gds employees 13 were salaried and 216 were hourly we believe that our relations with our employees are favorable none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement 

in managing our human capital resources we seek to 

• attract and retain a highly qualified and motivated workforce maintaining a conservative headcount to minimize workforce fluctuations promote job security and provide employees opportunities for learning and development 

• offer a competitive compensation and benefits package and 

• promote a safe and healthy workplace 

we believe these practices further described below are the key drivers in our very low voluntary turnover rates which averaged less than five percent over the fiveyear period ended december 31 2020 

recruiting hiring and advancement due to the cyclical nature of our business and the fluctuations in activity that can occur we take a conservative approach to managing our headcount carefully evaluating whether a new hire is necessary for an open position or whether we can fill the position by expanding the role of a current employee or several employees in this way we provide employees with opportunities to learn new roles and develop their skills horizontally and vertically and minimize layoffs and fluctuations when downturns occur when a position cannot be filled by expanding the role of a current employee or several employees we first consider opportunities to promote current employees before going to outside sources for a new 

hire when possible we believe this practice helps to reduce voluntary turnover among our workforce by providing employees with variety and new challenges throughout their career 

we identify qualified candidates by promoting the position internally engaging in recruiting through our website and online platforms conducting campus outreach filling internships and attending job fairs in our recruiting and hiring efforts we seek to foster a culture of mutual respect and strictly comply with all applicable federal state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment we treat all applicants with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender ethnicity religion national origin age marital status political affiliation sexual orientation gender identity disability or protected veteran status this philosophy extends to all employees throughout the lifecycle of employment including recruiting hiring placement promotion evaluation leaves of absence compensation and training 

compensation and benefits  o ur focus on providing competitive total compensation and benefits to our employees is a core value of ours and a key driver of our retention program we design our compensation programs to provide compensation that is competitive with our industry peers and rewards superior performance and for managers and executives aligns compensation with our performance and incentivizes the achievement of superior operating results we do this through a total rewards program that provides 

• base wages that are competitive for the position and considered for increases annually based on the job market industry outlook business performance and merit which is communicated through our annual performance review process 

• incentives that reward individual and company performance such as discretionary bonuses field and safety performance bonuses and shortterm and longterm incentive programs 

• retirement benefits including dollarfordollar matching contributions to a taxqualified defined contribution savings plan for all employees and a separate retirement contribution of 10 percent of salary and bonus for parentcompany employees 

• comprehensive health and welfare benefits including medical insurance prescription drug benefits dental insurance vision insurance life insurance accident insurance short and longterm disability benefits employee assistance program and health savings accounts 

• tuition reimbursement for eligible employees scholarship program and matching charitable contributions program 

• time off sick time and holiday time 

we believe that our compensation and benefits package is a strong retention tool and promotes personal health and financial security within our workforce 

health and safety  the health and safety of our employees is one of our core values for sustainable operations this value is reflected in our strong safety culture that emphasizes personal responsibility and safety leadership both for our employees and our contractors that are on our worksites our comprehensive environmental health and safety ehs management system establishes a corporate governance framework for ehs compliance and performance and covers all elements of our operating lifecycle these practices and the commitment of our management and our employees to our culture of safety have resulted in only two osha recordable incidents in 1528252 work hours over the threeyear period from 2018 through 2020 for an average total recordable incident rate of 026 over that threeyear period 

our ehs management system provided the framework to implement immediate and comprehensive safety protocols in response to the covid19 pandemic that struck suddenly in the first quarter of 2020 all of our employees are designated “critical infrastructure workers” under the cybersecurity  infrastructure security agency guidelines and as a result our field operations continued throughout 2020 the actions taken to prevent the spread of infection on our worksites and promote the health and safety of our workforce include 

• closing our offices and implementing “work from home” for all nonfield based employees 

• implementing and providing training on a covid19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols such as face coverings social distancing requirements and personal hygiene measures 

• providing additional personal protective equipment 

• implementing rigorous covid19 selfassessment contact tracing and quarantining protocols 

• increasing cleaning protocols at all locations 

• prohibiting all foreign and domestic business travel 

• providing additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid19 cases 

due to these measures all of our operations continued safely and uninterrupted during the pandemic in 2020 we also implemented appreciation award programs for many of our employees who continued to work onsite during the pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

business and operational risks 

commodity prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans refer to future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

wide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

• the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties on the global natural gas supply 

• the level of consumer demand for natural gas and oil which has been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

• weather conditions and seasonal trends 

• political economic or health conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions including the middle east africa south america and the united states including for example the impacts of local or international pandemics and disasters or events such as the global covid19 pandemic 

• the ability and willingness of the members of opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 

• the price level and quantities of foreign imports 

• actions of governmental authorities 

• the availability proximity and capacity of gathering transportation processing andor refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil 

• inventory storage levels and the cost and availability of storage and transportation of natural gas and oil 

• the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation including environmental and climate change regulation 

• the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 

• technological advances affecting energy consumption 

• speculation by investors in oil and natural gas 

• variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices and 

• overall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies 

these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future commodity prices if commodity prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us 

to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

• decreases in commodity prices 

• unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations 

• equipment failures or accidents 

• adverse weather conditions 

• surface access restrictions 

• loss of title or other title related issues 

• lack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof 

• compliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation including with respect to wastewater disposal discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing and 

• costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials 

our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

• the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of seismic data 

• the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects 

• the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled 

• economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews 

• our financial resources and results and 

• the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits 

these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 37 percent of our estimated proved reserves by volume were undeveloped these reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of 14 billion to convert our pud reserves into proved developed reserves the estimated future development costs associated with our pud reserves may not equal our actual costs development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated if we choose not to develop our pud reserves or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves in addition under the sec’s reserve reporting rules because pud reserves generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking we may be required to remove any pud reserves that are not developed within this fiveyear time frame 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania at december 31 2020 substantially all of our proved developed reserves and equivalent production were attributable to our properties located in the marcellus shale as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors state and local political forces and governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations severe weather events water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls in the region 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2020 will decrease at a rate of 10 percent 25 percent 17 percent and 13 percent during 2021 2022 2023 and 2024 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern to be fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2021 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2021 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

our ability to sell our natural gas production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such an event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future commodity prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

• the challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business 

• the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business 

• potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties and 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations 

the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

• well site blowouts cratering and explosions 

• equipment failures 

• pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids 

• uncontrolled flows of natural gas oil or well fluids 

• pipeline ruptures 

• fires 

• formations with abnormal pressures 

• handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids 

• release of toxic gas 

• buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials 

• pollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or operators of our properties and 

• natural disasters 

any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution natural resource damages regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our utilization of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2020 nonoperated wells represented approximately nine percent of our total owned gross wells or less than one percent of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

further driven in part by reduced commodity prices related to the global covid19 pandemic certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings debt refinancing transactions management changes or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market this could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future we may also see corporate consolidations among our competitors which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense and can be exacerbated following a downturn in which talented professionals leave the industry if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

risks related to our indebtedness and hedging activities 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection in addition there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community including investment advisors sovereign wealth funds public pension funds universities and other groups promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves which if successful could limit our ability to access capital markets future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 11 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

• require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations returning free cash flow to shareholders and future business opportunities 

• limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on incurring additional debt making certain investments and paying dividends 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations 

• depending on the levels of our outstanding debt limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes and 

• increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy including declines in commodity prices 

in addition the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our consolidated ebitdax or decreases in our ebitdax without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness may result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if commodity prices deteriorate from current levels or continue for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition  capital resources and liquidity” 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced which could limit us in the future 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 32 billion and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 15 billion the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of our revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower commodity prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

• there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production 

• production is less than expected or 

• a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations 

the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

legal regulatory and governmental risks 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental and safety compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action requirements and orders furthermore due to the outcome of the 2020 us congressional and presidential elections potential increased restrictions on oil and gas production activities may result which could have a material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry as a whole for example in january 2021 the biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations orders guidance documents policies and any similar agency promulgated during the prior administration that may 

be inconsistent with the current administration’s policies also in january 2021 the biden administration issued certain executive orders focused on addressing climate change which among other things revoked the permit for the keystone xl oil pipeline and directed the secretary of the interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

oil and natural gas production operations especially those using hydraulic fracturing are substantially dependent on the availability of water our ability to produce natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner 

water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling process in particular we use a significant amount of water in the hydraulic fracturing process our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations could adversely impact our operations for water sourcing we first seek to use nonpotable water supplies for our operational needs in certain areas there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site an inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas the imposition of new environmental regulations including as a result of potential regulatory and legislative changes due to the outcome of the 2020 us congressional and presidential elections could further restrict our ability to conduct operations such as hydraulic fracturing by restricting the disposal of waste such as produced water and drilling fluids compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection the padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works the regulations were developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition from time to time legislation has been introduced but not enacted in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if enacted such legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg under the new presidential administration the federal government may propose measures to impose additional regulations on or to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing the new administration has recently imposed such measures on federal lands in addition president biden has indicated support for a ban on hydraulic fracturing in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however these rules were rescinded by rule in december 2017 but similar rules could be proposed in the future in addition some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania and certain 

local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

further state and federal regulatory agencies have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity in recent years similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state in addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for example a pennsylvania state appellate court in 2018 appeared to refuse to apply the established common law rule of capture in a case concerning claims of trespass by hydraulic fracturing the pennsylvania supreme court heard the appeal of this ruling and on january 22 2020 in briggs v southwestern energy production co 224 a3d 334 pa 2020 affirmed the rule of capture and remanded the case to the pennsylvania state appellate court for further proceedings on december 8 2020 the appellate court issued a nonprecedential decision reversing its previous order vacating the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of southwestern energy production co southwestern the appellate court refuted the assumptions made by the pennsylvania supreme court concerning the appellate court’s disregard of the established rule of capture and based its reversal on the failure of plaintiffs to “specifically allege that southwestern engaged in horizontal drilling that extended onto their property or that southwestern propelled fracturing fluids and proppants across the property line” leaving open the possibility that hydraulic fracturing can constitute a physical invasion and thereby a trespass future developments in caselaw that expand the ability of adjacent property owners to prevail on trespass claims based on hydraulic fracturing could have a material impact on our operations 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works the regulations were developed under the epas effluent 

guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices in january 2021 the biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations orders guidance documents policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration’s policies additionally the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released its final report in december 2016 it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells this study and other studies that may be undertaken by the epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements two examples are the epa’s source aggregation rule and the epa’s new source performance standards and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 

in june 2016 the epa published a final rule concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry and as a result aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and timeconsuming air permitting particularly with respect to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for the oil and natural gas sector including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and neshap to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updated and expanded the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by the epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources was withdrawn in march 2017 in september 2020 the epa published a final rule amending the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and natural gas sector that removed transmission and storage sources from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane requirements applicable to the production and processing sources the same day as the publication of the september 2020 rule 20 states and three municipalities filed a petition for review of the epa’s final rule in the dc circuit court of appeals in october 2020 the dc circuit court of appeals denied emergency motions for a stay of the oil and natural gas sector nsps amendments from taking effect pending review the original petitioners have been joined by a number of environmental groups in challenging the september 2020 rule in the event the petitioners are successful and the september 2020 amendments to the 2012 and 2016 nsps for the oil and gas sector are struck down or if the new administration otherwise amends the epa’s regulations to impose regulations on methane or other additional regulatory requirements compliance with these potential requirements particularly a new methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site which could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and adversely impact our business 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” ghgs including carbon dioxide and methane may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes in response to such studies the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions in particular emissions from fossil fuels has and continues to attract political and social attention the regulatory response to and physical effects of climate change have the potential to negatively affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks 

legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the us congress and such legislation may be proposed or adopted in the future in addition the epa has adopted regulations addressing ghg emissions including rules 

requiring the monitoring reporting and recordkeeping of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states that cover onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year since 2012 we have been required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under these rules and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline in 2015 the epa finalized rules adding additional sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements including gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells and adding well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities the epa published a final rule in 2016 adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks in addition to the ghg monitoring and reporting rules the epa adopted rules requiring permits for ghgs for certain large stationary sources beginning in 2011 however in 2014 the us supreme court in utility air regulatory group v epa  limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants 

there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris unfccc which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years the united states was a signatory to the paris agreement which entered into full force in november 2016 former president trump announced the united states plan to withdraw from the paris agreement in june 2017 this withdrawal formally took effect november 4 2020 however newlyelected president biden has sought immediate reentry of the united states into the paris agreement upon his inauguration the terms and timeline under which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time 

it is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effect of climate change or to predict the effect of the paris agreement or whether additional ghg legislation regulations or other measures will be adopted at the federal state or local levels however more aggressive efforts by governments and nongovernmental organizations to reduce ghg emissions appear likely and any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for example several us states and cities have committed to advance the objectives of the paris agreement at the state or local level despite the pending federal withdrawal in addition in january 2021 the biden administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations orders guidance documents policies and any similar agency promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration’s policies including with respect to climate change also in january 2021 the biden administration issued certain executive orders focused on addressing climate change which among other things revoked the permit for the keystone xl oil pipeline and directed the secretary of the interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices further actions of the biden administration may negatively impact oil and gas operations and favor renewable energy projects in the us which may negatively impact the demand for natural gas or increase our operating costs 

the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

beyond financial and regulatory impacts climate change poses potential physical risks scientific studies forecast that these risks include an increase in sea level stresses on water supply and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events the projected physical effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect delay and result in increased costs related to our operations in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas however because the nature and timing of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity are uncertain any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change would be unreliable 

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws rules and directives collectively data protection laws relating to the processing of personal data 

the regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and violations of applicable data protection laws can result 

in significant penalties a determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these laws additionally the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws 

tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers the biden administration has also previously provided informal guidance on certain tax law changes that it would support which includes among other things raising tax rates on both domestic and foreign income and imposing a new alternative minimum tax on book income further many states are currently in deficits and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue 

should the us or the states pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions our taxes would increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown we cannot know the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business 

risks related to business disruption 

business disruptions from unexpected events including pandemics health crises and natural disasters may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including a public health crisis pandemic and epidemic war or civil unrest a terrorist act including a cybersecurity threat to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and to render data or systems unusable a weather event an earthquake or other catastrophe could cause instability in world financial markets and lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example the ongoing covid19 outbreak has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system such as quarantines shelterinplace orders and business and government shutdowns whether through a continuation of existing measures or the reimposition of prior measures we have taken precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk to our employees our business and the communities in which we operate and we are actively assessing and planning for various operational contingencies in the event one or more of our operational employees experiences any symptoms consistent with covid19 however if a significant portion of our employees or contractors were unable to work due to illness or if our field operations were suspended or temporarily restricted due to control measures designed to contain the outbreak that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we cannot guarantee that any precautionary actions taken by us will be effective in preventing disruptions to our business 

we regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and derivative contract counterparties although we have not received notices from our customers or counterparties regarding nonperformance issues or delays resulting from the covid19 pandemic to the extent we or any of our material suppliers or customers are unable to operate due to government restrictions or otherwise we may have to temporarily shut down or reduce production which could result in significant downtime and have significant adverse consequences for our business financial condition and results of operations in addition most of our nonoperational employees are now working remotely which could increase the risk of security breaches or other cyberincidents or attacks loss of data fraud and other disruptions 

furthermore the impact of the pandemic including a resulting reduction in demand for oil and natural gas coupled with the sharp decline in commodity prices following the announcement of price reductions and production increases in march 2020 by members of opec has led to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular while an agreement to cut production has since been announced by opec and its allies the situation coupled with the impact of covid19 and storage and transportation capacity constraints has continued to result in a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry we cannot predict the full impact that covid19 or the significant disruption and volatility currently being 

experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business financial condition and results of operations at this time due to numerous uncertainties for example although the negative effects on crude oil pricing have been more significant than effects on natural gas to date the operations of our midstream service providers on whom we rely for the transmission gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced natural gas may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing the outbreak andor the economic challenges may lead to a reduction in capacity or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our produced natural gas or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties the ultimate impacts will depend on future developments including among others the ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus any resurgence in covid19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience an improvement the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system the development of effective treatments the duration of the outbreak further actions taken by members of opec actions taken by governmental authorities customers suppliers and other third parties workforce availability and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume 

cyberattacks targeting our systems the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure or the systems of our thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our business 

our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data computer networks and connected infrastructure including technologies that are managed by thirdparty providers on whom we rely to help us collect host or process information we depend on this technology to record and store financial data estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states which are necessary to transport our products to market to enable communications and to provide a host of other support services for our business in response to the covid19 pandemic most of our nonoperational employees moved to a remote work model this model has significantly increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks including unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access and other cybersecurity related incidents 

cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software phishing ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption communication interruption or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations if our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations which may include drilling completion production and corporate functions a cyberattack involving our information systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production noncompliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties loss or disclosure of or damage to our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps 

in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient as cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyberattacks furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

risks related to our corporate structure 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue 

nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

• for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders 

• for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law 

• under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and 

• for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit 

this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

financial and operating overview 

financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 are as follows 

• natural gas production decreased 76 bcf or one percent from 8653 bcf in 2019 to 8577 bcf in 2020 the slight decrease was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices 

• average realized natural gas price for 2020 was 168 per mcf 31 percent lower than the 245 per mcf price realized in 2019 

• total capital expenditures were 5698 million in 2020 compared to 7833 million in 2019 

• drilled 74 gross wells 643 net with a success rate of 100 percent in 2020 compared to 96 gross wells 940 net with a success rate of 100 percent in 2019 

• completed 86 gross wells 773 net in 2020 compared to 99 gross wells 970 net in 2019 

• average rig count during 2020 was approximately 23 rigs in the marcellus shale compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 31 rigs during 2019 

• repaid 870 million of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes which matured in july 2020 

market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials weather conditions and other factors our realized prices are also further impacted by our hedging activities 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices particularly natural gas prices since substantially all of our production and reserves are natural gas significant declines in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition liquidity and ability to obtain financing lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically in addition in periods of low natural gas prices we may elect to curtail a portion of our production from time to time historically natural gas prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues in addition to commodity prices and production volumes finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

the ongoing covid19 outbreak which the world health organization who declared as a pandemic on march 11 2020 has reached more than 200 countries and territories and there continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which covid19 will continue to spread the development availability and administration of effective treatments and vaccines and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus and alleviate strain on the healthcare system and the economic impact of such actions one of the impacts of the covid19 

pandemic has been a significant reduction in demand for crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas the supplydemand imbalance driven by the covid19 pandemic as well as production disagreements among members of opec has led to significant global economic contraction generally and continues to have disruptive impacts on the oil and gas industry while subsequent negotiations between members of opec led to an agreement to reduce production volumes in an effort to stabilize crude oil prices crude oil prices remained at depressed levels throughout 2020 and continue to remain at depressed levels in 2021 as the oversupply and lack of demand in the market persist natural gas prices remained low during 2020 compared to 2019 including during the second half of 2020 in part due to lower seasonal demand during the shoulder season of 2020 and storage levels nearing capacity in response to the weakness of natural gas prices we strategically curtailed our production during the second half of 2020 resulting in an estimated curtailment of approximately 161 bcf of gross production 

meanwhile nymex natural gas futures prices have shown improvements since the implementation of pandemicrelated restrictions and opec price disagreements the improvements in natural gas futures prices are based on market expectations that declines in future natural gas supplies due to a substantial reduction of associated gas related to the curtailment of operations in oil basins throughout the united states will more than offset the lower demand recently experienced with the covid19 pandemic while the current outlook on natural gas prices is favorable and our operations have not been significantly impacted in the shortterm in the event these disruptions continue for an extended period of time our operations could be adversely impacted commodity prices could continue to decline further and our costs may increase while we are unable to predict future commodity prices at current natural gas price levels we do not believe that an impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels management would evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 

we have implemented preventative measures and developed response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and prevent infection among our employees and the communities in which we operate we also have modified certain business practices including those related to nonoperational employee work locations and the cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the centers for disease control and prevention the who and other governmental and regulatory authorities in addition we implemented and provided training on a covid19 safety policy containing personal safety protocols provided additional personal protective equipment to our workforce implemented rigorous covid19 selfassessment contract tracing and quarantine protocols increased cleaning protocols at all of our employee work locations and provided additional paid leave to employees with actual or presumed covid19 cases we also collaborated and continue to collaborate with customers to minimize potential impacts to or disruptions of our operations and to implement longerterm emergency response protocols we will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce our customers our service providers and the communities in which we operate including any resurgence in covid19 transmission and infection and take additional precautions as we believe are warranted 

our efforts to respond to the challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic as well as certain operational decisions we previously implemented such as our maintenance capital program have helped to minimize the impact and any resulting disruptions of the pandemic to our business and operations we have not required any funding under any federal or other governmental programs to support our operations and we do not expect to have to utilize any such funding as a result we currently believe that we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in a lower commodity pricing environment and can endure the current cyclical downturn in the energy industry and continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by 

• continuing to exercise discipline in our capital program with the expectation of funding our capital expenditures with cash on hand operating cash flows and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

• continuing to manage our portfolio by strategically curtailing production in periods of weaker natural gas prices 

• continuing to optimize our drilling completion and operational efficiencies resulting in lower operating costs per unit of production 

• continuing to manage our balance sheet which we believe provides sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants and 

• continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our production 

the impact that covid19 will have on our business cash flows liquidity financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments including among others the duration ultimate geographic spread and severity of the virus any resurgence in covid19 transmission and infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience an improvement the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus and alleviate 

strain on the healthcare system the development of effective treatments actions taken by governmental authorities customers suppliers and other third parties workforce availability and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume 

for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues refer to “results of operations” below 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2020 were from the sale of natural gas production including the receipt of derivative cash settlements and certain income tax receivables related to alternative minimum tax credit refunds these cash flows were used to fund our capital expenditures principal and interest payments on debt and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of our cash flows 

the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties effective april 23 2020 the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at 32 billion and 15 billion respectively as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our unused commitments remained at 15 billion 

a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under our revolving credit facility unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt we believe that with internally generated operating cash flow cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans 

at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes refer to note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding restrictive covenants 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows 



operating activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices changes in our production volumes and operating expenses commodity prices have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas pipeline infrastructure constraints basis differentials inventory storage levels seasonal influences and other factors in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures 

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility repayments of debt the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively payment of dividends repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had a working capital surplus of 255 million and 2402 million respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 decreased by 6676 million compared to 2019 this decrease was primarily due to lower natural gas revenue and lower derivative settlement gains these decreases were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the decrease in natural gas revenue was primarily due to a 

decrease in realized natural gas prices and marginally lower natural gas production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 31 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 natural gas production decreased by one percent for 2020 compared to 2019 which was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices 

refer to results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased by 406 million from 2019 compared to 2020 the increase was due to lower proceeds of 2588 million from sale of our investment in meade in november 2019 and constitution in january 2020 partially offset by 2125 million of lower capital expenditures as a result of the implementation of our maintenance capital program in 2020 and 93 million of lower capital contributions associated with our equity method investments 

financing activities cash flows used in financing activities decreased by 4345 million from 2019 compared to 2020 the decrease was due to 5199 million of lower repurchases of our common stock in 2020 compared to 2019 and 74 million of lower debt issuance costs associated with the amendment of our revolving credit facility in 2019 these decreases were partially offset by 800 million higher net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes in 2020 and 139 million of higher dividend payments related to an increase in our dividend rate in 2019 

2019 and 2018 compared for additional information on the comparison of operating investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 refer to financial condition cash flows included in the cabot oil  gas corporation annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

1 includes 1880 million and 870 million of current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2020 during 2019 we repurchased 255 million shares of our common stock for 4885 million during 2020 and 2019 we paid dividends of 1594 million 040 per share and 1455 million 035 per share on our common stock respectively 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



 

1 exploration expenditures include 36 million 22 million and 977 million of exploratory dry hole expenditures in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in 2020 we drilled 74 gross wells 643 net and completed 86 gross wells 773 net of which 26 gross wells 260 net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years in 2021 we plan to allocate substantially all of our capital to the marcellus shale where we expect to drill and complete 80 net wells our 2021 capital program is expected to be approximately 5300 million to 5400 million we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 are set forth in the following table 



 

1 interest payments have been calculated utilizing the rates associated with our senior notes outstanding at december 31 2020 assuming that our senior notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates 

2 for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements and operating leases refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table due to the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligations at december 31 2020 was 860 million refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

our reserves estimate has been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 002 per mcfe and an increase of 002 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate this estimated impact is based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis we cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that we believe will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline we would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

derivative instruments 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward commodity prices basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 

contingency reserves 

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases our judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of 

other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use a monte carlo valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of this model requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations 

our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities refer to the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants 

  our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage 

our business involves a variety of operating risks refer to risk factors—business and operational risks—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activities 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices further declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however we may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the 

use of financial commodity derivatives including collars and swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2020 and 2019 compared 

we reported net income for 2020 of 2005 million or 050 per share compared to net income for 2019 of 6811 million or 164 per share the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues and lower earnings on equity method investments partially offset by lower operating and income tax expenses 

revenue price and volume variance 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



natural gas revenues 



the decrease in natural gas revenues of 5803 million was due to lower production and lower natural gas prices the slight decrease in production was driven by strategic curtailments of production during a portion of the second half of 2020 due to weaker natural gas prices 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations decreased by 190 million from 2019 to 2020 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• direct operations decreased 36 million primarily due to lower production and continued efficiencies in our operations in the marcellus shale offset by higher workover expenses during the period 

• transportation and gathering decreased 36 million due to lower throughput as a result of lower marcellus shale production partially offset by higher demand charges 

• taxes other than income decreased 27 million due to 35 million lower drilling impact fees driven by a decrease in rates associated with lower natural gas prices and a decrease in drilling activity in 2020 compared to 2019 partially offset by a 11 million decrease in production tax refunds that were received in 2019 

• exploration decreased 49 million primarily due to a 35 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses 13 million decrease in employee costs and 09 million decrease in other exploration costs these decreases were partially offset by higher exploratory dry hole costs of 14 million 

• depreciation depletion and amortization decreased 148 million primarily due to lower amortization of unproved properties of 244 million partially offset by higher dda of 83 million amortization of unproved properties decreased due to lower amortization rates as a result of a decrease in exploration activities the increase in dda was primarily due to an increase of 115 million related to a higher dda rate of 043 per mcfe for 2020 compared to 042 per mcfe for 2019 partially offset by a decrease of 32 million due to lower natural gas production volumes in the marcellus shale 

• general and administrative increased 105 million primarily due to a 124 million increase in stockbased compensation expense associated with certain of our marketbased performance awards and a 50 million increase in legal expenses these increases were partially offset by 25 million of lower severance costs that were incurred in the third quarter 2019 and a 50 million decrease in employeerelated costs the remaining changes in other general and administrative expense were not individually significant 

loss earnings on equity method investments 

earnings on equity method investments decreased 806 million primarily due to the sale of our investment in meade in the fourth quarter of 2019 for a gain of 758 million and constitution in february 2020 for a loss of 94 million that was previously accrued in 2019 there was no significant activity during 2020 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased 08 million primarily due to 27 million of lower interest expense related to the repayment of 870 million of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes which matured in july 2020 and 35 million of interest income associated with certain income tax refunds received in the fourth quarter of 2020 these decreases were partially offset by a 31 million reversal of interest expense in 2019 related to certain income tax reserves previously recorded in prior periods 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased 1786 million due to lower pretax income and a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 168 percent and 243 percent respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to research and development tax credit benefits recorded in 2020 related to amended prior year returns 

2019 and 2018 compared 

we reported net income for 2019 of 6811 million or 164 per share compared to net income for 2018 of 5570 million or 125 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to lower operating expenses and interest expense and higher earnings on equity method investments these increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher income tax expense 

for additional information on the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 refer to managements discussion and analysis included in the cabot oil  gas corporation annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

nongaap financial measures 

explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap however we believe certain nongaap performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods in addition we believe these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry the reconciliations of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10k are shown below 

reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income 

adjusted net income is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure enables a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results adjusted net income is defined as net income plus gain and loss on sale of assets gain and loss on derivative instruments gain on sale of equity method investments stockbased compensation expense severance expense interest expense related to income tax reserves and tax effect on selected items additionally this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap 



 

1 this amount represents the noncash marktomarket changes of our commodity derivative instruments recorded in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

return on capital employed 

return on capital employed roce is defined as adjusted net income defined above plus aftertax net interest expense divided by average capital employed which is defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity roce is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure is useful information to investors when evaluating our profitability and the efficiency with which we have employed capital over time roce is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as defined by gaap 



 

1 interest expense related to income tax reserves is included in the adjustments to as reported  net income net of tax 

discretionary cash flow and free cash flow calculation and reconciliation 

discretionary cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and service debt discretionary cash flow is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income as defined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 

free cash flow is defined as discretionary cash flow defined above less capital expenditures and investment in equity method investments free cash flow is an indicator of a companys ability to generate cash flow after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base free cash flow is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income as defined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by spot market prices for north american natural gas production which can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of commodity price volatility for our production in the natural gas markets through the use of financial commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our financial commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our financial commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 

periodically we enter into financial commodity derivatives including collar swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to commodity price declines related to our natural gas production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into financial commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our financial derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index 

as of december 31 2020 we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 



the amounts set forth in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2020 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative contracts while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by several of our banks 

in early 2021 the company entered into the following financial commodity derivatives 



a significant portion of our expected natural gas production for 2021 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2020 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 190 to 215 per mmbtu and ceiling prices ranging from 210 to 238 per mmbtu covered 923 bcf or 11 percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 209 per mmbtu natural gas swaps covered 535 bcf or six percent of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 224 per mmbtu 

we are exposed to market risk on financial commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and 

credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices refer to “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration and production of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value through the commodity price cycles by maintaining our disciplined approach to returnsfocused capital allocation while we operate in a cyclical industry driven by the volatility of commodity prices we believe that focusing on the following key components of our business strategy positions us to succeed on creating shareholder value through the commodity price cycles 

focus on financial returns our goal is to generate financial returns that exceed our cost of capital by focusing on disciplined capital investment and maintaining a low cost structure in 2019  our return on capital employed nongaap was 222 percent  an increase from 159 percent in 2018  commodity prices play a critical role in our capital allocation decisions and have a significant impact on our financial returns 

demonstrate continued cost control underpinning our financial returns is our continued focus on cost control which resulted in an 18 percent reduction in operating expenses per unit in 2019 relative to 2018  we believe maintaining a low cost structure provides us with a competitive advantage especially in a low natural gas price environment we continue to assess additional opportunities to reduce our operating expenses per unit over time 

maintain financial strength we believe that maintaining a strong balance sheet with significant financial flexibility is imperative in a cyclical industry that is exposed to commodity price volatility in recent years we have reduced our absolute debt levels and we anticipate retiring the current portion of our debt at maturity in 2020  we improved our total debt to total capitalization ratio from 370 percent at yearend 2018 to 362 percent at yearend 2019  additionally we ended 2019 with strong liquidity resulting from 2002 million of cash and cash equivalents and 15 billion of unused commitments on our revolving credit facility 

generate positive free cash flow we believe generating positive free cash flow is paramount to creating shareholder value our disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us to adjust our capital spending and activity levels in response to commodity prices in order to maximize positive free cash flow through the price cycles our free cash flow is used for returning capital to shareholders reducing debt levels and enhancing liquidity in 2019  we generated 14 billion in cash flow from operations gaap and 5631 million of free cash flow nongaap representing our fourth consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation 

return capital to shareholders we currently target returning at least 50 percent of our free cash flow to shareholders annually through dividends and share repurchases in 2019  we returned 6654 million of capital to shareholders representing 118 percent of our free cash flow for the year we increased our dividend twice during 2019 and have increased our dividend five times since 2017 since reinstating our share repurchase program in 2017 we have reduced our shares outstanding by over 14 percent we plan to continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders through all commodity price cycles 

increase our proved reserve base in 2019  we increased our yearend proved reserves by 11 percent at an allsources finding and development cost nongaap of 036 per mcfe we also replaced 250 percent of our production for the year we intend to continue to increase our proved reserves through our disciplined investment in the development of our marcellus shale asset assuming the commodity price environment provides for economic returns for our shareholders 

refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  nongaap financial measures for a discussion and calculation of return on capital employed free cash flow and finding and development cost which are nongaap financial measures 

2020 outlook 

our 2020 capital program is expected to be approximately 5750 million  a 27 percent reduction from our 2019 capital program of 7833 million  we reduced our planned capital program as a result of the lower natural gas price environment we expect to fund these expenditures with our operating cash flow and if required cash on hand 

in 2020  our capital program will focus on the marcellus shale where we expect to drill complete and place on production 60 to 70 net wells  we allocate our planned program for capital expenditures based on market conditions return on capital and free cash flow expectations and availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may adjust our capital expenditures accordingly 

description of properties 

our operations are primarily concentrated in one unconventional play—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania our marcellus shale properties represent our primary operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 173000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2019 net production in the marcellus shale was 865 bcfe representing substantially all of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2019  we had a total of 7880 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 995 percent are operated by us 

during 2019  we invested 7734 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 940 net wells completed 970 net wells and turned in line 970 net wells as of december 31 2019  we had 260 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2019 with three drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2020 with two rigs operating 

divestitures 

in july 2018 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the haynesville shale to a third party for 300 million and recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of 297 million  

in february 2018 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale to an affiliate of venado oil  gas llc for 7650 million  during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 4143 million associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 454 million  

in september 2017 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio to an affiliate of carbon natural gas company for 413 million  during the second quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 686 million associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing the sale in the third quarter of 2017 we recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 119 million  

in february 2016 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 564 million and recognized a 05 million gain on sale of assets 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts and is subject to seasonal price swings the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states where we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies gas marketers and power generation facilities 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

delivery commitments 

we have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell natural gas we believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of our commitments but may be required to purchase natural gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur 

a summary of our firm sales commitments as of december 31 2019 are set forth in the table below 



we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas under the majority of these firm sales contracts and have entered into numerous agreements for transportation of our production some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms however we do not believe we have a financial commitment due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations 

risk management 

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2019  natural gas basis swaps covered 638 bcf or seven percent  of natural gas production at an average price of 232 per mcf natural gas swaps covered 2261 bcf or 26 percent  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 330 per mcf 

as of december 31 2019  we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 

in early 2020  we entered into the following financial commodity derivatives 



a significant portion of our expected natural gas production for 2020 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas market prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 

 

 our proved reserves at december 31 2019 increased 1298 bcfe or 11 percent from 11605 bcfe at december 31 2018  in 2019  we added 2116 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the results from our drilling and completion program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net upward revision of 47 bcfe which was primarily due to a net upward performance revision of 67 bcfe  partially offset by a downward revision of 18 bcfe associated with proved undeveloped pud reserves reclassifications as a result of the five year limitation the net upward performance revision of 67 bcfe was primarily due to an upward revision of 417 bcfe associated with our pud reserves due to performance revisions and the drilling of longer lateral length wells offset by a downward performance revision of 350 bcfe related to certain proved developed producing properties during 2019  we produced 865 bcfe 

since substantially all of our reserves are natural gas our reserves are significantly more sensitive to natural gas prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factors our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated ” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our reserves including decline curve extrapolations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our senior vice president ehs and engineering is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of two engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by miller and lents he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 37 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 28 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management 

miller and lents has audited 100 percent of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 30 2020 has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not retained on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2019  we had 4847 bcfe of pud reserves associated with future development costs of 18 billion  which represents an increase of 645 bcfe compared to december 31 2018  all of our pud reserves are located in susquehanna county pennsylvania we expect to complete substantially all of our pud reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of 2020  future development plans are reflective of the lower commodity price environment and have been established based on expected available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  all pud reserves are expected to be drilled and completed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves with the exception of two drilled but uncompleted wells these wells are scheduled to be completed in early 2020 just beyond the fiveyear period since initial disclosure and together represent 16 percent of our total pud reserves and less than 10 percent of our total proved reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 

changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 



 production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which represents more than 15 percent of our total proved reserves 

 

 acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2019  

 

includes leasehold and mineral fee net acreage of 585686 and 147371 respectively associated with deep formations located in west virginia and virginia substantially all of this leasehold is held by production from shallower formations that are operated by others 

total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2019 is 78534 13747 and 3998 for the years ending december 31 2020  2021 and 2022  respectively 

as of december 31 2019  less than one percent of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our primary operating areas where we currently expect to continue exploration and development activities andor extend the lease terms there were no pud reserves recorded on any of our expiring acreage disclosed above 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2019  this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 

 

 drilling activity 

we drilled and completed wells or participated in the drilling and completion of wells as indicated in the table below the information below should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value 

during the year ended december 31 2019  we completed 29 gross wells  290 net that w ere drilled in prior years 

the following table sets forth information about wells for which drilling was in progress or which were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2019  which are not included in the above table 

other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the year ended december 31 2019  three customers accounted for approximately 17 percent  16 percent and 16 percent of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2018  two customers accounted for approximately 20 percent and 11 percent of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2017  two customers accounted for approximately 18 percent and 11 percent of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations 

where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and ngpa and the ferc’s regulations thereunder up to 1000000 per day per violation this maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation as of december 31 2019 the maximum penalty amount was 1269500 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to ferc jurisdiction however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of the ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions 

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are 

executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum 

sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year re‑determination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 percent should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or any potential future challenges to pipelines rates 

environmental and safety regulations 

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes as well as wastes that are exempt from such regulation the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess the need to regulate exploration and production related oil and gas wastes exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra under subtitle d applicable to nonhazardous solid waste the consent decree required the epa to propose a rulemaking by march 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary in april 2019 the epa issued its determination that based on its review including consideration of state regulatory programs it was not necessary at the time to revise subtitle d regulations to address the management of oil and gas wastes in the future we could be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than we encounter today 

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and implementing regulations which are primarily executed through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with applicable emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution facilities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in addition in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps including removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry in september 2019 the epa published a proposal to rescind the 2012 and 2016 nsps rules applicable to sources in the transmission and storage segment of the oil and gas industry and to rescind the methane requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments in its september 2019 proposal as an alternative the epa proposed the rescission of all of the new source performance standards applicable to all oil and natural gas sources in the source category without otherwise undoing the 2012 and 2016 nsps rules in october 2015 the epa adopted a lower national ambient air quality standard for ozone the revised standard could result in additional areas being designated as ozone nonattainment which could lead to requirements for additional emissions control equipment and the imposition of more stringent permit requirements on facilities in those areas the epa completed its final area designations under the new ozone standard in july 2018 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells in addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factors federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows ” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered but not enacted legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes potential regulation of methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector if we are unable to recover 

or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read “risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislative and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce” in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community right‑ to‑know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety

 item 1a risk factors 

commodity prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business  

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results natural gas prices based on the nymex henry hub natural gas futures final settlement prices were 3642 per mmbtu in january 2019 and 2470 per mmbtu in december 2019  prices have continued to decline to 1877 per mmbtu in february 2020 any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans refer to risk factors future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

wide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future commodity prices if commodity prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us 

to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 38 percent of our estimated proved reserves by volume were undeveloped these reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of 18 billion to convert our pud reserves into proved developed reserves the estimated future development costs associated with our pud reserves may not equal our actual costs development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated if we choose not to develop our pud reserves or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves in addition under the sec’s reserve reporting rules because pud reserves generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking we may be required to remove any pud reserves that are not developed within this fiveyear time frame 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

the value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania at december 31 2019 substantially all of our proved developed reserves and equivalent production were attributable to our properties located in the marcellus shale as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors state and local political forces and governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations severe weather events water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls in the region 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable  

in general the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be 

able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2019 will decrease at a rate of 13 percent 26 percent 18 percent and 14 percent during 2020  2021  2022 and 2023  respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern to be fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 12 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

 in addition the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our consolidated ebitdax or decreases in our ebitdax without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness may result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if commodity prices deteriorate from current levels or continue for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition  capital resources and liquidity” 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced which could limit us in the future 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 32 billion  and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 15 billion  the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of our revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower commodity prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2020 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2020 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such an event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future commodity prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses  

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our utilization of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environ mental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2019  nonoperated wells represented approximately nine percent of our total owned gross wells or approximately one percent of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies 

may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

oil and natural gas production operations especially those using hydraulic fracturing are substantially dependent on the availability of water our ability to produce natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner 

water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling and in particular hydraulic fracturing process our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations could adversely impact our operations for water sourcing we first seek to use nonpotable water supplies for our operational needs in certain areas there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site an inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas the imposition of new environmental regulations could further restrict our ability to conduct operations such as hydraulic fracturing by restricting the disposal of things such as produced water and drilling fluids 

federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive several candidates in the 2020 united states presidential campaign have indicated that they would support federal government efforts to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in addition from time to time legislation has been introduced but not enacted in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if enacted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however these rules were rescinded by rule in december 2017 we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

in addition state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by the epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources were withdrawn in march 2017 the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry 

compliance with these requirements especially the new methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business similarly aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and time consuming air permitting particularly in regard to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state in addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for example a pennsylvania state trial court in 2018 refused to apply the established common law rule of capture in a case concerning claims of trespass by hydraulic fracturing the pennsylvania supreme court heard the appeal of this ruling and on january 22 2020 affirmed the rule of capture and remanded the case to the pennsylvania state trial court for further proceedings depending on the ultimate outcome at the pennsylvania state trial court this case could still have a material impact on our operations 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works the regulations were developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices for example the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released its final report in december 2016 it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells this study and other studies that may be undertaken by the epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” ghgs including carbon dioxide and methane may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes in response to such studies the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions in particular emissions from fossil fuels has and continues to attract political and social attention the regulatory response to and physical effects of climate change have the potential to negatively affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks 

legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the us congress and such legislation may be proposed or adopted in the future in addition the epa has adopted regulations addressing ghg emissions in 2009 and 2010 the epa adopted rules requiring the monitoring reporting and recordkeeping of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year since 2012 we have been required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under these rules and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline in 2015 the epa finalized rules adding additional sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements including gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells and adding well identification reporting requirements for 

certain facilities the epa published a final rule in 2016 adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks in addition to the ghg monitoring and reporting rules the epa adopted rules requiring permits for ghgs for certain large stationary sources beginning in 2011 however in 2014 the us supreme court in utility air regulatory group v epa  limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants a discussion of federal methane regulations is provided in the preceding risk factor 

there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris the “unfccc” which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years the united states was a signatory to the paris agreement which entered into full force in november 2016 on june 1 2017 the president of the united states announced that the united states planned to withdraw from the paris agreement and to seek negotiations to either reenter the paris agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement the earliest possible effective date for the united states withdrawal is november 4 2020 which is four years from the date the agreement took effect the united states’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time 

it is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effect of climate change or to predict the effect of the paris agreement or whether additional ghg legislation regulations or other measures will be adopted at the federal state or local levels however more aggressive efforts by governments and nongovernmental organizations to reduce ghg emissions appear likely and any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions for example several us states and cities have committed to advance the objectives of the paris agreement at the state or local level despite the pending federal withdrawal 

the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

beyond financial and regulatory impacts climate change poses potential physical risks scientific studies forecast that these risks include an increase in sea level stresses on water supply and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events the projected physical effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect delay and result in increased costs related to our operations in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas however because the nature and timing of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity are uncertain any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change would be unreliable 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

cyberattacks targeting our systems the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure or the systems of our thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our business 

our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data computer networks and connected infrastructure including technologies that are managed by thirdparty providers on whom we rely to help us collect host or process information we depend on this technology to record and store financial data estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers 

control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states which are necessary to transport our products to market to enable communications and to provide a host of other support services for our business 

cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software phishing ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data unauthorized access to our seismic data reserves information customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption communication interruption or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations if our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations which may include drilling completion production and corporate functions a cyberattack involving our information systems and related infrastructure or that of our business associates could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production noncompliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties loss or disclosure of or damage to our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps 

in addition certain cyber incidents such as surveillance may remain undetected for an extended period and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient as cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyberattacks furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws rules and directives collectively “data protection laws” relating to the processing of personal data 

the regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties a determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these laws additionally the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws 

tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws beginning generally in 2018 refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for a discussion on the impact of the tax act on us there exist various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the tax act in the absence of guidance we have used what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the tax act it is possible that the internal revenue service could issue subsequent regulations or other guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the tax act maintained many of the tax incentives and deductions that are used by us oil and gas companies including the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas companies the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred and the current amortization period of geological and geophysical expenditures for independent producers the us tax law is always subject to change periodically legislation is proposed to repeal these industry tax incentives and deductions andor to impose new industry taxes in addition various states are still determining if and to what extent they will conform to the tax act further many states are currently in deficits and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue 

should the us or the states publish guidance or pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions our taxes would increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash 

flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown we cannot know the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

environmental matters 

on june 17 2019 we received two proposed consent order and agreements coa from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep relating to gas migration allegations in areas surrounding several wells owned and operated by us in susquehanna county pennsylvania the allegations relating to these wells were initially raised by residents in the area in march and june 2017 respectively in the form of complaints about their drinking water supply since then we have been engaged with the padep in investigating the incidents and have performed appropriate remediation efforts including the provision of alternative sources of drinking water to the affected residents we received notices of violation nov from the padep in june and november 2017 respectively for failure to prevent the migration of gas into fresh groundwater sources in the area surrounding these wells with regard to the june 2017 nov we believe these water quality complaints have been resolved and we are working with the padep to reach agreement on the disposition of this matter the proposed coa is the culmination of this effort and if finalized would result in the payment of a civil monetary penalty in an amount likely to exceed 100000 up to approximately 215000 we will continue to work with the padep to finalize the coa and to bring this matter to a close with regard to the november 2017 nov the proposed coa if finalized as drafted would require cabot to submit a detailed written remediation plan continue water sampling and other investigative measures and restore or replace affected water supplies and would result in the payment of a civil monetary penalty in an amount likely to exceed 100000 up to approximately 355000 we will continue to work with the padep to finalize the coa and to complete the ongoing investigation and remediation 

from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate relating to alleged violations of environmental statutes or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder while we cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines andor penalties if fines andor penalties are imposed they may result in monetary sanctions individually or in the aggregate in excess of 100000

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annul report on form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

financial and operating overview 

financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 are as follows 

 

market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials weather conditions and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues we expect commodity prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our revenues refer to results of operations below refer to risk factors— commodity prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business  and risk factors— our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable  in item 1a 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile we believe that we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in a volatile commodity pricing environment by 

 while we are unable to predict future commodity prices in the e vent that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2019 were from the sale of natural gas production and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in meade these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures interest payments on debt repurchases of shares of our common stock payment of dividends and contributions to our equity method investments see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

on april 22 2019 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement revolving credit facility the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at 32 billion and 15 billion  respectively as of december 31 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our unused commitments remained at 15 billion  

a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under our revolving credit facility unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt we believe that with internally generated operating cash flow cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans 

at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes refer to note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding restrictive covenants 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows 

operating activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices changes in our production volumes and operating expenses commodity prices have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply 

and demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints basis differentials inventory storage levels and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures 

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility repayments of debt the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively payment of dividends repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had a working capital surplus of 2402 million and 2573 million  respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 increase d by 3409 million compared to 2018  this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash received in settlement of derivatives higher natural gas revenue lower operating expenses and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities these increases were partially offset by a decrease in brokered natural gas revenue the increase in natural gas revenue was due to higher equivalent production partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas prices average realized natural gas prices decrease d by 4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018  equivalent production increase d by 18 percent for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale 

refer to results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increase d by 2505 million from 2018 compared to 2019  the increase was due to 6758 million lower proceeds from the sale of assets primarily due to the divestiture of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018 and our haynesville shale assets in july 2018 this change was partially offset by 2495 million of proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in meade in november 2019 1061 million of lower capital expenditures and 679 million of lower capital contributions associated with our equity method investments 

financing activities cash flows used in financing activities decrease d by 5989 million from 2018 compared to 2019  the decrease was due to 3529 million of lower repurchases of our common stock in 2019 and 2900 million of lower net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes in 2018 this decrease was partially offset by 341 million of higher dividend payments related to an increase in our dividend rate in 2019 74 million higher debt issuance costs related to amending our revolving credit facility in early 2019 and 24 million higher tax withholdings on vesting of stock awards share repurchases in 2019 include 314 million of share repurchases that were accrued in 2018 and paid in 2019  

2018 and 2017 compared for additional information on the comparison of operating investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  refer to financial condition cash flows included in the cabot oil  gas corporation annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018  

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

 during 2019 and 2018 we repurchased 255 million shares of our common stock for 4885 million and 385 million shares of our common stock for 9041 million  respectively during 2019 and 2018  we paid dividends of 1455 million  035 per share and 1114 million  025 per share on our common stock respectively 

in april 2019 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 007 per share to 009 per share  in october 2019 the board of directors approved an additional increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 009 per share to 010 per share 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 

 

 in 2019  we drilled 96 gross wells  940 net and completed 99 gross wells  970 net of which 29 gross wells  290 net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years in 2020  we plan to allocate substantially all of our capital to the marcellus shale where we expect to drill complete and place on production 60 to 70 net wells  our 2020 capital program is expected to be approximately 5750 million  we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 are set forth in the following table 

 



amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table due to the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligations at december 31 2019 was 721 million  refer to note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserves data included in this document is only an estimate the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

our reserves estimate has been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 002 per mcfe and an increase of 002 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate this estimated impact is based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is 

estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity are expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

derivative instruments 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward commodity prices basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 

contingency reserves 

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations 

our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities refer to the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants 

  our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage 

our business involves a variety of operating risks refer to risk factors— we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses  in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activitie s 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices further declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives including collars and swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2019 and 2018 compared 

we reported net income for 2019 of 6811 million  or 164 per share compared to net income for 2018 of 5570 million  or 125 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to lower operating expenses and interest expense and higher earnings on equity method investments these increases were partially offset by lower operating revenues and higher income tax expense 

revenue price and volume variance 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 1041 million was due to higher production partially offset by lower natural gas prices the increase in production was a result of an increase in our drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of 487 million was primarily due to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

brokered natural gas 

brokered natural gas revenues decreased 2095 million  there was no brokered natural gas activity in the current period 

operating and other expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations decrease d by 2116 million from 2018 to 2019  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



earnings on equity method investments 

earnings on equity method investments increase d 794 million primarily due to the sale of our investment in meade for a gain of 758 million and the recognition of our proportionate share of net income from our equity method investments in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily from our investment in meade which commenced operations in late 2018 

loss on sale of assets 

during 2019  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 15 million primarily due to the conveyance of certain remaining properties related to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets during 2018  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 163 million primarily due to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets partially offset by a gain on the sale of oil and gas properties in the haynesville shale 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased 182 million primarily due to 141 million lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of 2370 million of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes which matured in july 2018 and 670 million of our 978 senior notes that matured in december 2018 and a 62 million decrease related to income tax reserves these decreases were partially offset by 36 million of lower interest income 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increase d 781 million due to higher pretax income and a higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 243 percent and 202 percent  respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of nonrecurring discrete items recorded during 2019 compared to 2018 

excluding the impact of any discrete items we expect our 2020 effective income tax rate to be approximately 230 percent  however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state rates that occur during the year changes in our executive compensation and the amount of excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers 

2018 and 2017 compared 

we reported net income for 2018 of 5570 million  or 125 per share compared to net income for 2017 of 1004 million  or 022 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating revenues lower operating expenses and higher earnings on equity method investments partially offset by higher income tax expense 

for additional information on the comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017  refer to managements discussion and analysis included in the cabot oil  gas corporation annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018  

nongaap financial measures 

explanation and reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap however we believe certain nongaap performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods in addition we believe these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry the reconciliations of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures presented in this annual report on form 10k are shown below 

reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income 

adjusted net income is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure enables a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results adjusted net income is defined as net income plus gain and loss on sale of assets gain and loss on derivative instruments gain on sale of equity method investments stockbased compensation expense severance expense interest expense related to income tax reserves and tax effect on selected items additionally this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap 



 

 

return on capital employed 

return on capital employed roce is defined as adjusted net income defined above plus aftertax net interest expense divided by average capital employed which is defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity roce is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure is useful information to investors when evaluating our profitability and the efficiency with which we have employed capital over time roce is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as defined by gaap 



 



discretionary cash flow and free cash flow calculation and reconciliation 

discretionary cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities pay dividends and service debt discretionary cash flow is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income as defined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 

free cash flow is defined as discretionary cash flow defined above less capital expenditures and investment in equity method investments free cash flow is an indicator of a companys ability to generate cash flow after spending the money required to maintain or expand its asset base free cash flow is presented based on our belief that this nongaap measure is useful information to investors when comparing our cash flows with the cash flows of other companies free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or net income as defined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 

finding and development costs 

drillbit finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in exploration and development activities as defined by gaap divided by reserve extensions discoveries and other additions allsources finding and development cost is defined as costs incurred in property acquisition exploration and development activities as defined by gaap divided by the total of reserve extensions discoveries and other additions and revision of prior estimates drillbit finding and development cost and allsources finding and development cost are presented based on managements belief that these nongaap measures are useful information to investors to evaluate how much it costs to add proved reserves these calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves and may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by spot market prices for north american natural gas production which can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of commodity price volatility for our production in the natural gas markets through the use of financial commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our financial commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our financial commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 

periodically we enter into financial commodity derivatives including collar swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to commodity price declines related to our natural gas production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into financial commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our financial derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index 

as of december 31 2019  we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 

the amounts set forth in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2019 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which we have derivative contracts while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

in early 2020  we entered into the following financial commodity derivatives 



a significant portion of our expected natural gas production for 2020 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas market prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2019  natural gas basis swaps covered 638 bcf or seven percent of natural gas production at an average price of 232 per mcf natural gas swaps covered 2261 bcf or 26 percent  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 330 per mcf 

we are exposed to market risk on financial commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices refer to “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration and production of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm we believe this is attainable by employing disciplined returnsfocused management of our balance sheet and our operations key components of our business strategy include 

 these strategies will be achieved through further growth and development of our cornerstone asset in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania which represents substantially all of our equivalent proved reserves as of december 31 2018  while we remain focused on the growth and development of our marcellus shale asset we also look for other development and exploration opportunities that will contribute to our overall strategy 

2019  outlook 

our 2019  capital program is expected to be approximately 8000 million  we expect to fund these expenditures with our operating cash flow and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

in 2019  our capital program will focus on the marcellus shale where we expect to drill and complete 85 to 90 net wells and place 80 to 85 net wells on production we allocate our planned program for capital expenditures based on market conditions return expectations and availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

description of properties   

our operations are primarily concentrated in one unconventional play—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania our marcellus shale properties represent our primary operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 174000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2018  net production in the marcellus shale was 7291  bcfe representing substantially all of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2018  we had a total of 6955 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 993 percent are operated by us 

during 2018  we invested 7839 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 860 net wells completed 840 net wells and turned in line 840 net wells as of december 31 2018  we had 290 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2018  with four drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2019  with three rigs operating 

acquisitions 

in december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 305 million total cash consideration paid was 299 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs 

in october 2014 we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 2100 million total cash consideration paid at closing was 1852 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs in april 2015 we completed the acquisition of the remaining oil and gas properties for which the seller was unable to obtain consents at closing for 160 million 

divestitures 

in july 2018 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the haynesville shale to a third party for 300 million  and recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of 297 million  

in february 2018 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale to an affiliate of venado oil  gas llc for 7650 million  during the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 4143 million  associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 454 million  

in september 2017 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio to an affiliate of carbon natural gas company for 413 million  during the second quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 686 million  associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing the sale in the third quarter of 2017 we recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 119 million  

in february 2016 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 564 million  and recognized a 05 million  gain on sale of assets 

in october 2014 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 443 million and recognized a 199 million gain on sale of assets 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts and is subject to seasonal price swings the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states where we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies gas marketers and power generation facilities 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

delivery commitments 

we have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell natural gas we believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of our commitments but may be required to purchase natural gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur 

a summary of our firm sales commitments as of december 31 2018  are set forth in the table below 



we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas under the majority of these firm sales contracts and have entered into numerous agreements for transportation of our production some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms however we do not believe we have a financial commitment due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations 

risk management   

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap 

agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2018  natural gas basis swaps covered 446  bcf or six percent  of natural gas production at an average price of 276  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 976  bcf or 13 percent  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 295  per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 5500  per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 6335  to 6380  per bbl covered 02  mmbbl or 33 percent   of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 6362  per bbl 

in january 2018 as a result of the sale of our eagle ford shale assets we terminated all of our outstanding crude oil financial derivatives for 03 million 

as of december 31 2018  we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 



in early 2019 we entered into the following financial commodity derivative contracts 



while we have hedged a portion of our expected natural gas production for 2019  any unhedged production is directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas market prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



 

 our proved reserves at december 31 2018  increased 1879 bcfe or 19 percent  from 9726  bcfe at december 31 2017  in 2018  we added 22435  bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the positive results from our drilling and completion program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net upward revision of 7804  bcfe which was due to an upward performance revision of 11230 bcfe primarily associated with positive drilling results in our dimock field in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by a downward revision of 3446 bcfe associated with proved undeveloped pud reserves reclassifications as a result of the five year limitation during 2018  we sold 4103  bcfe of proved reserves which were primarily related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale and haynesville shale and produced 7350  bcfe 

since substantially all of our reserves are natural gas our reserves are significantly more sensitive to natural gas prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average natural gas crude oil and ngl index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factors our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated ” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our reserves including decline curve extrapolations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic 

interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our senior vice president south region and engineering is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of two engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by miller and lents he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 36 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 27 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management 

miller and lents has audited 100 percent  of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 28 2019 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not retained on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2018  we had 42020  bcfe of pud reserves associated with future development costs of 16 billion which represents an increase  of 6633  bcfe compared to december 31 2017  substantially all of our pud reserves are located in susquehanna county pennsylvania we expect to complete substantially all of our pud reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of 2019  future development plans are reflective of the expected increase in commodity prices and have been established based on cash on hand expected available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  all pud reserves are expected to be drilled and completed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 



production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which represents more than   15 percent   of our total proved reserves   

 

 acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2018  



 



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2018  is 10775 78389 and 13189 for the years ending december 31 2019  2020  and 2021  respectively 

we expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities through renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options as of december 31 2018  approximately 10 percent  of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our primary operating areas where we currently expect to continue exploration and development activities andor extend the lease terms 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2018  this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



 

 drilling activity 

we drilled and completed wells or participated in the drilling and completion of wells as indicated in the table below the information below should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value   

during the year ended december 31 2018  we completed 27  gross wells  270  net that w ere drilled in prior years   

the following table sets forth information about wells for which drilling was in progress or which were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2018  which are not included in the above table 



other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  three  customers accounted for approximately 20 percent  11 percent  and nine percent  two  customers accounted for approximately 18 percent  and 11 percent  and two  customers accounted for approximately 19 percent  and 10 percent  respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production   

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation   

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce 

although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and ngpa and the ferc’s regulations thereunder up to 1000000 per day per violation this maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation as of december 31 2018 the maximum penalty amount was 1213503 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines were subject to regulation by the ferc during 2017 until september 29 2017 we owned an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our former whollyowned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provided interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that were regulated by the west virginia public service commission we no longer own any interest in cranberry pipeline corporation and do not operate any natural gas pipelines subject to fercs jurisdiction 

in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth  per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 percent  equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the 124‑mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date has been impacted by the public regulatory permitting process currently the inservice date for constitution cannot be reasonably estimated if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga see note 4  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the legal and regulatory actions involving constitution 

in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20 percent  equity interest in meade pipeline co llc meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transco’s mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania on february 3 2017 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline and the resulting central penn line was placed into service on october 6 2018 the central penn line is an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga 

on august 14 2018 we entered into a precedent agreement with transco for up to 250000 dth per day of firm transportation capacity on transcos proposed leidy south expansion project we will also be participating as an equity owner in the expansion project through our ownership in meade and expect to contribute approximately 171 million our proportionate share of the anticipated costs of the expansion project the expansion project is anticipated to be inservice as early as the fourth quarter of 2021 assuming all necessary regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner and construction proceeds on schedule 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most 

pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non affiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions   

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum   

sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year re‑determination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 percent  should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or any potential future challenges to pipelines rates 

environmental and safety regulations   

general   our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental 

authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste   we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess its rcra subtitle d criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra the consent decree requires the epa to propose a rulemaking by march 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act   the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act   the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings 

that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 

clean water act   the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act   our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution facilities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in addition in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps including removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry in october 2015 the epa adopted a lower national ambient air quality standard for ozone the revised standard could result in additional areas being designated as ozone nonattainment which could lead to requirements for additional emissions control equipment and the imposition of more stringent permit requirements on facilities in those areas the epa completed its final area designations under the new ozone standard in july 2018 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act   the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing   many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells   in 

addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected   for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factors federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows ” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas   in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered but not enacted legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes regulation of methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by the epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources was withdrawn in march 2017 if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read “risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce” in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations   we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community right‑ to‑know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety

 item 1a risk factors 

commodity prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business  

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas and oil that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans see risk factors future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future commodity prices if commodity prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated   

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and 

such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties the present value of future cash flows are based on 258  per   mcf of natural gas 2164  per bbl of ngls and 6521  per bbl of oil as of december 31 2018  actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 percent  discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future commodity price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

the value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania at december 31 2018  substantially all of our proved developed reserves and equivalent production were attributable our properties located in the marcellus shale as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors state and local political forces and governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations severe weather events water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls in the region 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable  

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2018  will increase at a rate of one percent during 2019 and decrease at a rate of 27 percent 19 percent and 15 percent during 2020  2021  and 2022  respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 12 billion  of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

 in addition the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our consolidated ebitdax or decreases in our ebitdax without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness may result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if commodity prices deteriorate from current levels or continue for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition  capital resources and liquidity” 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced which could limit us in the future 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 32 billion  and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 18 billion   the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of our revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower commodity prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2019  plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2019  plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or 

termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future commodity prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses  

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 



 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our utilization of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environ mental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks in addition certain segments of our pipelines will periodically require repair replacement or maintenance which may be costly 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2018  nonoperated wells represented approximately 111 percent of our total owned gross wells or approximately one percent of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and 

payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition from time to time legislation has been introduced but not enacted in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if enacted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however these rules were rescinded by rule in december 2017 we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

in addition state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in 

march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided in march 2018 the epa published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the nsps removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by the epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources were withdrawn in march 2017 the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry 

compliance with these requirements especially the new methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business similarly aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and time consuming air permitting particularly in regard to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state in addition if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected for example a decision by a pennsylvania state court in 2018 if upheld could change the established common law rule of capture and apply liability to oil and gas companies for trespass when hydraulic fracturing results in the production of oil and gas from adjoining property which may impose burdens on hydraulic fracturing in pennsylvania that may be material 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works the regulations were developed under the epas effluent 

guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices for example the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released its final report in december 2016 it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells this study and other studies that may be undertaken by the epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years the united states signed the paris agreement in april 2016 however on august 4 2017 the united states formally communicated to the united nations its intent to withdraw from participation in the paris agreement which entails a fouryear process in response to the announced withdrawal plan a number of state and local governments in the united states have expressed intentions to take ghgrelated actions increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions 

in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants in october 2015 the epa finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements these new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells the revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities also in november 2016 the epa published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks 

federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

cyberattacks targeting our systems the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure or the systems of our thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our business 

our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data computer networks and connected infrastructure including technologies that are managed by thirdparty providers on whom we rely to help us collect host or process information we depend on this technology to record and store financial data estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states which are necessary to transport our products to market to enable communications and to provide a host of other support services for our business 

a cyberattack may involve a hacker a virus malware phishing or other actions for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption unauthorized access to our proprietary information could lead to data corruption or communication or operational disruptions a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage those assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for transported products in addition our thirdparty service providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyberattacks which in turn could adversely affect our operations and compromise our information 

we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future as cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyberattacks furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws rules and directives collectively “data protection laws” relating to the processing of personal data 

the regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties a determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these laws additionally the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws 

tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws beginning generally in 2018 refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for discussion on the impact of the tax act on the company there exist various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the tax act in the absence of guidance we have used what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the tax act it is possible that the internal revenue service could issue subsequent regulations or other guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the tax act maintained many of the tax incentives and deductions that are used by us oil and gas companies including the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas companies the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred and the current amortization period of geological and geophysical expenditures for independent producers the us tax law is always subject to change periodically legislation is proposed to repeal these industry tax incentives and deductions andor to impose new industry taxes in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the tax act further many states are currently in deficits and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue 

should the us or the states publish guidance or pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions our taxes would increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown we cannot know the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

financial and operating overview   

financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to the year ended december 31 2017  are as follows 

 market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the commodity prices and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials weather conditions and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues we expect commodity prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues refer to results of operations below see risk factors— commodity prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business  and risk factors— our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable  in item 1a 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile we believe that we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in a volatile commodity pricing environment by 

 while we are unable to predict future commodity prices in the e vent that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in   2018   were from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production and proceeds from the sale of assets these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures contributions to our equity method investments principal and interest payments on debt repurchase of shares of our common stock and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties effective april 18 2018  the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at 32 billion  and 17 billion  respectively as of december 31 2018  we had 70 million  of borrowings outstanding and unused commitments of 18 billion  under our revolving credit facility 

a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under our revolving credit facility unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt we believe that with internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans 

at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both our revolving credit facility and senior notes see note 5  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows 

operating activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices changes in our production volumes and operating expenses commodity prices have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints basis differentials inventory storage levels and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues   

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility repayments of debt the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2018  and 2017  we had a working capital surplus  of 2573 million  and 1349 million  respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility available to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2018   increase d by 2067 million  compared to 2017  this increase  was primarily due to higher  operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase  in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase  in realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher  equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices increase d by 10 percent  and 32 percent  respectively for 2018  compared to 2017  equivalent production increase d by seven percent  for 2018  over 2017  as a result of higher  natural gas production in the marcellus shale 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased by 5007 million compared to 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices increased by 36 percent  and 29 percent  respectively for 2017 compared to 2016 equivalent production increased by nine percent  for 2017 over 2016 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decrease d by 4128 million  from 2017  to 2018  due to 5629 million   higher  proceeds from the sale of assets primarily due to the divestiture of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018 and our haynesville shale assets in july 2018 this change was partially offset by 1299 million   higher  capital expenditures and 202 million   higher  capital contributions associated with our equity method investments 

cash flows used in investing activities increased by 3529 million from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase of 3894 million in capital expenditures and 286 million higher capital contributions associated with our equity method investments partially offset by 650 million higher proceeds from the sale of assets 

financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increase d by 10788 million  from 2017  to 2018  due to 7490 million   higher  repurchases of our common stock in 2018  2970 million  of higher  net repayments of debt primarily related to maturities of certain of our senior notes during 2018 and 325 million  of higher  dividend payments related to an increase in our dividend rate in 2018 

cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 6643 million from 2016 to 2017 due to 9953 million lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2016 1237 million of repurchases of our common stock in 2017 and 427 million of higher dividend payments related to an increase in the dividend rate in 2017 and the issuance of common stock 

in 2016 these decreases were partially offset by 4970 million of lower net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2016 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

 during 2018  we repurchased 385 million  shares of our common stock for 9041 million  during 2018  and 2017  we paid dividends of 1114 million   025  per share and 788 million   017  per share on our common stock respectively 

in january 2018 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 005 per share to 006 per share   in october 2018 the board of directors approved an additional increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 006  per share  to 007  per share  

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



 

 in 2018  we drilled 97  gross wells  951  net and completed 94  gross wells  930  net of which 27  gross wells  270  net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years in 2019  we plan to allocate the majority of our capital to the marcellus shale where we expect to drill and complete 85 to 90 net wells and place 80 to 85 net wells on production our 2019  capital program is expected to be approximately 8000 million  we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31   2018   are set forth in the following table 

 

 amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table due to the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligations at december 31 2018  was 516 million  see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as commodity prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new 

geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a five percent  positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 002 per mcfe and an increase of 002 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate this estimated impact is based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future commodity prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 42 million or decrease by approximately 33 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful and the properties are abandoned or surrendered the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

derivative instruments 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward commodity prices basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of commodity prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 

contingency reserves 

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes 

valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

other issues and contingencies   

regulations   our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage   our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors— we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses  in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing commodity prices further declines in commodity prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower commodity prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically commodity prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of financial commodity derivatives including collars and swaps to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2018  and 2017  compared 

we reported net income  for 2018  of 5570 million  or 125  per share compared to net income  for 2017  of 1004 million  or 022  per share the increase  in net income  was primarily due to higher  operating revenues lower  operating expenses and higher  earnings on equity method investments partially offset by higher income tax expense 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





natural gas revenues 

the increase  in natural gas revenues of 3751 million  was due to higher  natural gas prices and production the increase in production was a result of an increase in our drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the decrease  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 1636 million  was due to lower  production partially offset by higher  crude oil prices the decrease in production was the result of the sale of our eagle ford shale assets in february 2018 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

brokered natural gas   

the   234 million   increase   in brokered natural gas margin is a result of an increase in brokered activity this increase was due to higher volumes associated with natural gas purchases that were required to satisfy certain sales obligations 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations decrease d by 4023 million  from 2017  to 2018  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the increase in earnings loss on equity method investments is due to an other than temporary impairment of 959 million  associated with our equity method investment in constitution that was recognized in 2017  partially offset by the recognition of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investment in meade which commenced operations in late 2018  

loss on sale of assets 

during 2018  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 163 million  primarily due to the sale of our eagle ford shale assets partially offset by a gain on the sale of oil and gas properties in the haynesville shale during 2017  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 116 million  primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased   89 million  primarily due to 77 million lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of 2370 million of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes which matured in july 2018 and 67 million of our 978 senior notes that matured in december 2018 in addition to the lower interest due to debt repayments we had 41 million higher interest income these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by 31 million higher interest expense related to uncertain tax positions initially recorded in the second quarter of 2018 

other expense income 

other income decrease d 54 million  primarily due to a lower curtailment gain on postretirement benefits as a result of the termination of approximately 100 employees associated with the sale of oil and gas properties in west virginia in 2017  

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense increase d 4699 million  due to higher pretax income partially offset by a lower  effective tax rate   the effective tax rates for 2018  and 2017  were 202 percent  and 1439 percent  respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of nonrecurring discrete items recorded during 2017 related to the tax act that was enacted in december 2017 the tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 percent  starting in 2018 refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of income tax expense and the impact of the tax act on our financial results 

excluding the impact of any discrete items we expect our 2019 effective income tax rate to be approximately 230 percent  however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state rates that occur during the year changes in our executive compensation and the amount of excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers 

2017  and 2016  compared 

we reported net income  for 2017  of 1004 million  or 022  per share compared to net loss  for 2016  of 4171 million  or 091  per share the increase in net income was primarily due to higher operating revenues and higher income tax benefit partially offset by higher operating expenses and loss on sale of assets 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 4835 million was due to higher natural gas prices and production the increase in production was a result of an increase in our drilling and completion activities in the marcellus shale 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 612 million was due to higher production and crude oil prices 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

brokered natural gas 

the 08 million  decrease in brokered natural gas margin is a result of an increase in purchase price that outpaced the increase in sales price and higher brokered volumes 

operating and other expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 871 million  from 2016  to 2017  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



 loss on equity method investments 

the increase in loss on equity method investments is due to an other than temporary impairment of 959 million associated with our equity method investment in constitution that was recorded in 2017 and recording our proportionate share of net losses from our equity method investments which increased in 2017 compared to 2016 

loss on sale of assets 

loss on sale of assets increased   97 million  due to our sale of certain oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio during 2016  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 19 million  primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties in east texas 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased   62 million  primarily due to a 18 million increase in interest income and a 21 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016 which has remained undrawn through december 31 2017 interest expense also decreased 24 million resulting from the repurchase of 640 million of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of 200 million of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes in july 2016 

loss on debt extinguishment 

a 47 million debt extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the premium paid for the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the writeoff of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repayment 

other expense income 

other income increased 66 million primarily due to a curtailment gain of 49 million on postretirement benefits as a result of the termination of approximately 100 employees associated with the sale of oil and gas properties in west virginia in 2017 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax benefit increase d 864 million  due to a higher  effective tax rate partially offset by a lower  pretax loss the effective tax rates for 2017  and 2016  were 1439 percent  and 368 percent  respectively the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the tax act that was enacted in december 2017 the tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 percent  starting in 2018 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk   

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by spot market prices for north american natural gas production which can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of commodity price volatility for our production in the natural gas markets through the use of financial commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our financial commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our financial commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 

periodically we enter into financial commodity derivatives including collar swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to commodity price declines related to our natural gas production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into financial commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our financial derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2018  we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 



in early 2019 we entered into the following financial commodity derivative contracts 



the amounts set forth in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2018  and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

a significant portion of our expected natural gas production for 2019  and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas market prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2018  natural gas basis swaps covered 446  bcf or six percent  of natural gas production at an average price of 276  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 976  bcf or 13 percent  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 295  per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 5500  per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 6335  to 6380  per bbl covered 02  mmbbl or 33 percent  of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 6362  per bbl 

in january 2018 as a result of the sale of our eagle ford shale assets we terminated all of our outstanding crude oil financial derivatives for 03 million 

we are exposed to market risk on financial commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm we believe this is attainable by employing disciplined management of our balance sheet and our operations and remaining focused on our core asset base key components of our business strategy include 

 these strategies will be achieved through further growth and development of our cornerstone assets in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania which represent 96  percent of our equivalent proved reserves as of december 31 2017 while we remain focused on the growth and development of our marcellus shale asset we also look for other development and exploration opportunities that will contribute to our overall strategy 

2018  outlook 

our 2018  drilling program includes approximately 8900 million  in capital expenditures and approximately 600 million  in expected contributions to our equity method investments we expect to fund these expenditures with existing cash operating cash flow and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility see note 4  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade pipeline co llc meade 

in 2018  we plan allocate the majority of our capital to the marcellus shale where we expect to drill 85  gross wells  850  net and complete 95  gross wells  950  net we allocate our planned program for capital expenditures based on market conditions return expectations and availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

as a result of the expected inservice of various infrastructure projects including the atlantic sunrise pipeline during 2018 we increased our budgeted capital expenditures compared to   2017  we plan to operate an average of approximately 30 rigs in the marcellus shale in   2018  

description of properties   

our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in one unconventional play—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania we also have operations in various other unconventional plays throughout the continental united states 

marcellus shale 

our marcellus shale properties represent our primary operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 172000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2017  net production in the marcellus shale was 6417  bcfe representing approximately 94 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 6093 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 99 are operated by us 

during 2017  we invested 4079 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 559 net wells completed 542 net wells and turned in line 530 net wells as of december 31 2017  we had 270 net wells that were either in 

the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2017  with two drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2018  with three rigs operating 

other properties 

eagle ford shale  our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio and la salle counties texas where we hold approximately 79000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2017  our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford shale was 4939 mbbl and 33 bcf respectively or 330 bcfe representing approximately 5 of our total equivalent production as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 2700 net wells in the eagle ford of which approximately 90 are operated by us 

on december 19 2017 we entered into an agreement to sell our operated and nonoperated eagle ford shale assets to an affiliate of venado oil  gas llc for 7650 million subject to customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments we expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of 2018 

other properties   we also operate or participate in other unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas and the utica shale in pennsylvania   

on december 11 2017 we entered into an agreement to sell our operated and nonoperated haynesville shale assets to an undisclosed buyer for 300 million subject to customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments we expect to close this transaction in the first half of 2018 

acquisitions 

in december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 305 million total cash consideration paid was 299 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs 

in october 2014 we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 2100 million total cash consideration paid at closing was 1852 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs in april 2015 we completed the acquisition of the remaining oil and gas properties for which the seller was unable to obtain consents at closing for 160 million 

divestitures 

in september 2017 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio to a third party for 413 million  during the second quarter of 2017 we recorded an impairment charge of 686 million  associated with the proposed sale of these properties and upon closing the sale in the third quarter of 2017 we recognized a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of 119 million  

in february 2016 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 564 million  and recognized a 05 million  gain on sale of assets 

in october 2014 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 443 million and recognized a 199 million gain on sale of assets

in 2013 we sold various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties for 443 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts and is subject to seasonal price swings the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states where we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies gas marketers and power generation facilities 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering 

systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

our crude oil is sold at market sensitive prices under longterm sales contracts the principal markets for our oil are in the south texas refining region where we can market to refineries and oil pipeline customers 

delivery commitments 

we have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell natural gas we believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of our commitments but may be required to purchase natural gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur 

a summary of our firm sales commitments as of december 31 2017  are set forth in the table below 



we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas under the majority of these firm sales contracts and have entered into numerous agreements for transportation of our production some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms however we do not believe we have a financial commitment due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations 

risk management   

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2017  natural gas collars with floor prices of 309  per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 342  to 345   per mcf covered 355  bcf or 5  of natural gas production at an average price of 320  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 517  bcf or 8  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 323  per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 5000  per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 5625  to 5650  per bbl covered 18  mmbbl or 41  of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 5178  per bbl 

as of december 31 2017  we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 



in january 2018 we entered into the following financial commodity derivatives 



in the tables above natural gas prices are stated per mcf and crude oil prices are stated per barrel 

while we have hedged a portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2018  and beyond any unhedged production is directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

as of december 31 2017 we had the following outstanding physical commodity derivatives 



in the table above natural gas prices are stated per mcf 

in january 2018 we terminated certain physical purchase contracts prior to their settlement date the termination did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as the contracts were previously recognized at fair value 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



 

 our proved reserves totaled approximately 9726  bcfe at december 31 2017  of which 96  were natural gas this reserve level was up by 13 from 8576  bcfe at december 31 2016  in 2017  we added 12361  bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the positive results from our drilling and completion program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net upward revision of 9285  bcfe which was due to an upward performance revision of 8638 bcfe primarily associated with positive drilling results in our dimock field in northeast pennsylvania and 1030 bcfe associated with higher commodity prices partially offset by a downward revision of 383 bcfe associated with proved undeveloped pud reserves reclassifications as a result of the five year limitation in 2017  we produced 6853  bcfe 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average natural gas crude oil and ngl index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factorsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our natural gas crude oil and ngl reserves including decline curve extrapolations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our senior vice president south region and engineering is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of three engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by miller and lents he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 35 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 26 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management 

miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 26 2018 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not retained on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2017  we had 35387  bcfe of pud reserves associated with future development costs of 15 billion which represents an increase  of 5854  bcfe compared to december 31 2016  approximately 94 of our pud reserves are located in susquehanna county pennsylvania we expect to complete approximately 100 of our pud reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of 2018  future development plans are reflective of the expected increase in commodity prices and have been established based on cash on hand expected available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  all pud reserves are expected to be drilled and completed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 



 production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which represents more than 15 of our total proved reserves   



 

 acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2017  



 

 total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2017  is 36983 10880 and 34380 for the years ending december 31 2018  2019  and 2020  respectively 

we expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options as of december 31 2017  approximately 23 of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our primary areas of operation where we currently expect to continue development activities andor extend the lease terms 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2017  this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



 

 drilling activity 

we drilled and completed wells or participated in the drilling and completion of wells as indicated in the table below the information below should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value   

during the year ended december 31 2017  we completed 50  gross wells  443  net that w ere drilled in prior years   

the following table sets forth information about wells for which drilling was in progress or which were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2017  which are not included in the above table 



other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  two  customers accounted for approximately 18  and 11  two  customers accounted for approximately 19  and 10  and two  customers accounted for approximately 16  and 14  respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production   

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or 

flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation   

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and ngpa and the ferc’s regulations thereunder up to 1000000 per day per violation this maximum penalty authority established by statute has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines were subject to regulation by the ferc during 2017 until september 29 2017 we owned an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our former whollyowned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provided interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that were regulated by the west virginia public service commission we no longer own any interest in cranberry pipeline corporation and do not operate any natural gas pipelines subject to fercs jurisdiction 

in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the 124‑mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date has been impacted by the public regulatory permitting process currently the inservice date for constitution cannot be reasonably estimated if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga see note 4  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the legal and regulatory actions involving constitution 

additionally in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20  equity interest in meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga transco filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc on march 31 2015 on february 3 2017 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project and the project is under construction with a current expected inservice date of mid2018 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also 

implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non‑affiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions   

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum   

our sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year re‑determination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or any potential future challenges to pipelines rates 

environmental and safety regulations   

general    our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste    we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess its rcra subtitle d criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra the consent decree requires the epa to propose a rulemaking by march 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund    the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act    the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act    the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 

clean water act    the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act    our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution facilities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in addition in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry in october 2015 the epa adopted a lower national ambient air quality standard for ozone the revised standard could result in additional areas being designated as ozone nonattainment which could lead to requirements for additional emissions control equipment and the imposition of more stringent permit requirements on facilities in those areas epa anticipates promulgating final area designations under the new ozone standard in the first half of 2018 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act    the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing    many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could 

increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas    in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered but not enacted legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes regulation of methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas sector a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources was withdrawn in march 2017 if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read “risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce” in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations    we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community right‑ to‑know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas and oil that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves  changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices any substantial or extended decline in future natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans see risk factors future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas and oil prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower 

prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties the present value of future cash flows are based on 233  per mcf of natural gas 2064  per bbl of ngls and 4926  per bbl of oil as of december 31 2017  actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

the value of our oil and gas properties depends on prices of natural gas and crude oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties because our reserves are predominately natural gas  approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves  changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area 

our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania at december 31 2017 97  of our proved developed reserves and 94 of our total equivalent production were attributable our properties located in the marcellus shale and we expect that concentration to increase slightly in 2018 as a result of the expected sales of our remaining texas properties in the first half of 2018 as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors state and local political forces and governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations severe weather events water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls in the region 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2017  will decrease at a rate of 12 25 18 and 14 during 2018  2019  2020  and 2021  respectively future development of proved 

undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 15 billion  of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

 in addition the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our consolidated ebitdax or decreases in our ebitdax without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness may result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if the price that we receive for our natural gas and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of decreased natural gas and oil prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition  capital resources and liquidity” 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced which could limit us in the future 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 32 billion  and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 17 billion  the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower natural gas or oil prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our 

ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2018  plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2018  plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs in addition we may be liable for 

environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we may acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 



 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our utilization of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environ mental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks in addition certain segments of our pipelines will periodically require repair replacement or maintenance which may be costly 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2017  nonoperated wells represented approximately 147 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 38 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition from time to time legislation has been introduced but not enacted in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if enacted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however these rules were rescinded by rule in december 2017 we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

in addition state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic 

fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in june 2017 the epa proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the june 2016 rule and in november 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30day comment period on the information provided a 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by epa in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources were withdrawn in march 2017 the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry 

compliance with these requirements especially the new methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business similarly aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and time consuming air permitting particularly in regard to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 though it was later lifted in 2015 and new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works the regulations were developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices for example the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of 

hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released its final report in december 2016 it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years the united states signed the paris agreement in april 2016 however on august 4 2017 the united states formally communicated to the united nations its intent to withdraw from participation in the paris agreement which entails a fouryear process in response to the announced withdrawal plan a number of state and local governments in the united states have expressed intentions to take ghgrelated actions increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions 

in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants in october 2015 the epa finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements these new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells the revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities also in november 2016 the epa published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks 

federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any 

changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

cyberattacks targeting our systems or the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data computer networks and connected infrastructure we depend on this technology to record and store financial data estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states which are necessary to transport our products to market 

a cyberattack may involve a hacker a virus malware phishing or other actions for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption unauthorized access to our proprietary information could lead to data corruption or communication or operational disruptions a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage those assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for transported products 

we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future as cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyberattacks furthermore the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements 

tax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted legislation referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act significantly changes us corporate income tax laws beginning generally in 2018 these changes include among others i a permanent reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat rate of 21 ii elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax iii immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time iv limitation on the tax deduction for interest expense to 30 of adjusted taxable income v limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80 of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks and vi elimination of many business deductions and credits including the domestic production activities deduction the deduction for entertainment expenditures and the deduction for certain executive compensation in excess of 1 million refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements income taxes for additional discussion on the impact of the tax act on the company in the absence of guidance on various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the tax act we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the tax act overall we expect the provisions of the tax act to favorably impact the companys future effective tax rate aftertax earnings and cash flows however it is possible that the internal revenue service could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

while the tax act maintains many of the tax incentives and deductions that are used by us oil and gas companies including the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas companies the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred and the current amortization period of geological and geophysical expenditures for independent producers the us tax law is always subject to change periodically legislation is proposed to repeal these industry tax incentives and deductions andor to impose new industry taxes in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the tax act further many states are currently in deficits and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions carryforwards and credits in order to increase tax revenue 

should the us or the states pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions our taxes would increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since future changes to federal and state tax legislation are unknown we cannot know the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

financial and operating overview   

financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the year ended december 31 2016  are as follows 

 market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels 

basis differentials weather conditions and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues location differentials have increased in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues refer to results of operations below see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

commodity prices have remained volatile but have improved during 2017  compared to the fourth quarter of 2016  in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge 

we believe that we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in depressed commodity pricing environment and that we can endure the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by 



financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2017  were from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production and proceeds from the sale of assets these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures including contributions to our equity method investments repurchase of shares of our common stock and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties effective april 11 2017  the borrowing base and available commitments were reaffirmed at 32 billion  and 17 billion  respectively as of december 31 2017  we had no  borrowings outstanding and unused commitments of 17 billion  under our revolving credit facility 

in december 2017 we entered into an agreement to sell certain of our eagle ford shale assets for 7650 million  and expect to close on the sale in the first quarter of 2018 the lenders under our revolving credit facility have agreed to waive the requirement that the borrowing base be reduced upon closing of the eagle ford sale provided that the sale of these assets is considered in our upcoming annual borrowing base redetermination on april 1 2018 

a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt we believe that with the existing cash on hand internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans 

at december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes as of december 31 2017  based on our asset coverage and leverage ratios there were no interest rate adjustments required for our senior notes see note 5  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows 



operating activities   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints basis differentials inventory storage levels and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues   

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility repayments of debt the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively sales and repurchases of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had a working capital surplus  of 1349 million  and 4581 million  respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility available to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2017   increase d by 5007 million  when compared to 2016  this increase  was primarily due to higher  operating revenues partially offset by higher  operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase  in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase  in realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher  equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices increase d by 36  and 29  respectively for 2017  compared to 2016  equivalent production increase d by 9  for 2017  over 2016  as a result of higher  natural gas production in the marcellus shale 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased by 3522 million when compared to 2015 this decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities and lower operating revenues partially offset by lower operating expenses excluding noncash expenses the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 21 and 18 respectively for 2016 compared to 2015 equivalent production increased by 4 for 2016 over 2015 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale partially offset by lower crude oil production in the eagle ford shale 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities   cash flows used in investing activities   increase d by   3529 million   from   2016   to   2017   due to an   increase   of   3894 million   in capital expenditures and   286 million   higher   capital contributions associated with our equity method investments partially offset by   650 million   higher   proceeds from the sale of assets 

cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 6401 million from 2015 to 2016 due to a decrease of 5804 million in capital expenditures 163 million lower acquisition costs and 428 million higher proceeds from the sale of assets 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities decrease d by 6643 million  from 2016  to 2017  due to 9953 million  lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2016 1237 million  of repurchases of our common stock in 2017 and 427 million  of higher  dividend payments related to an increase in the dividend rate in 2017 and the issuance of common stock in 2016 these decrease s were partially offset by 4970 million  of lower  net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in 2016 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 2305 million from 2015 to 2016 due to 9953 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of common stock and lower capitalized debt issuance costs of 46 million related to the amendment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes in december 2015 these increases were partially offset by 7700 million of higher net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and 31 million of higher dividend payments 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

 during 2017  we repurchased 50 million  shares of our common stock for 1237 million  during 2017  and 2016  we paid dividends of 788 million   017  per share and 362 million   008  per share on our common stock respectively in may 2017 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 002 per share to 005 per share 

in january 2018 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 005 per share to 006 per share 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



 

1     exploration expenditures include   38 million    101 million   and   33 million   of exploratory dry hole expenditures in    2017    2016   and   2015  respectively   

in 2017  we drilled 91  gross wells  825  net and completed 105  gross wells  942  net of which 50  gross wells  443  net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years in 2018  we plan to allocate the majority of our capital to the marcellus shale where we expect to drill 85  gross wells  850  net and complete 95  gross wells  950  net our 2018  drilling program includes approximately 8900 million  in total capital expenditures we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  are set forth in the following table 



 

 amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2017  was 643 million  of which 157 million  was classified as liabilities held for sale see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and crude oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 003 per mcfe and an increase of 004 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 004 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management 

would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 117 million or decrease by approximately 96 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties or internal models such quotes and models have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are derived from or verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of 

the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

other issues and contingencies   

regulations   our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 125  to 10 which increases to a ratio of 175 to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and thereafter our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage   our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary 

industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline furthermore we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar swap and basis swap arrangements to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2017  and 2016  compared 

we reported net income  for 2017  of 1004 million  or 022  per share compared to net loss  for 2016  of 4171 million  or 091  per share the increase  in net income  was primarily due to higher  operating revenues and higher  income tax benefit partially offset by higher  operating expenses and loss on sale of assets 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





natural gas revenues 

the increase  in natural gas revenues of 4835 million  was due to higher  natural gas prices and production the increase in production was a result of an increase in our drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 612 million  was due to higher  production and crude oil prices 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

brokered natural gas   

the 08 million   decrease  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of an increase  in purchase price that outpaced the increase  in sales price and higher brokered volumes 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 871 million  from 2016  to 2017  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



and other assets of 4356 million  due to the impairment of oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia 

 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the increase in loss on equity method investments is due to an other than temporary impairment of 959 million  associated with our equity method investment in constitution and recording our proportionate share of net losses from our equity method investments which increased in 2017  compared to 2016  

loss on sale of assets 

loss on sale of assets increased   97 million  due to the companys sale of certain oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets located in west virginia virginia and ohio during 2016  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 19 million  primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties in texas 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased   62 million  primarily due to a 18 million increase in interest income and a 21 million decrease in interest expense resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016 which has remained undrawn through december 31 2017  interest expense also decreased 24 million resulting from the repurchase of 640 million of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of 200 million of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes in july 2016 

loss on debt extinguishment 

a 47 million  debt extinguishment loss  was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the premium paid for the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the writeoff of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repayment 

other expense income 

other income increase d 66 million  primarily due to a curtailment gain of 49 million on postretirement benefits as a result of the termination of approximately 100 employees in west virginia 

income tax benefit 

income tax benefit increase d 864 million  due to a higher  effective tax rate partially offset by a lower  pretax loss the effective tax rates for 2017  and 2016  were 1439  and 368  respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the tax legislation referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act that was enacted in december 2017 the tax act significantly changes us corporate income tax laws by among other things reducing the us corporate income tax rate to 21 starting in 2018 refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the impact of the tax act on our financial results 

excluding the impact of any discrete items the provisions of the tax act are expected to reduce our 2018 effective income tax rate to approximately 240 to 260 however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state rates that occur during the year changes in our executive compensation the amount of excess tax benefits on stock based compensation as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers 

2016  and 2015  compared 

we reported a net loss  for 2016  of 4171 million  or 091  per share compared to net loss  for 2015  of 1139 million  or 028  per share the increase in net loss was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses partially offset by a higher income tax benefit 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





natural gas revenues 

the decrease in natural gas revenues of 25 million was due to lower natural gas prices partially offset by higher production the increase in production was a result of our drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of 971 million was due to lower production and crude oil prices the decrease in production was a result of a decrease in drilling and completion activities in south texas 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

brokered natural gas 

the 10 million  decrease in brokered natural gas margin is a result of a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase price and lower brokered volumes 

operating and other expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 2599 million  from 2015  to 2016  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the increase in loss on equity method investments is due to recording our proportionate share of net losses from our equity method investments which increased in 2016 compared to 2015 

gain loss on sale of assets 

during 2016  we recognized a net aggregate loss of 19 million primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties in east and south texas during 2015 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 39 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas 

loss on debt extinguishment 

a 47 million extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the premium paid for the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the writeoff of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repayment 

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased   86 million  due to a 55 million decrease resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016 which remained undrawn through december 31 2016 interest expense also decreased 34 million resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes at maturity these decreases were offset by a 06 million increase in commitment fees as a result of an increase in the unused portion of the commitments under our revolving credit facility 

income tax benefit 

income tax benefit increase d 1691 million  due to a higher pretax loss partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were 368 and 392 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of nonrecurring discrete items recorded during 2016 compared to 2015 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk   

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activities 

periodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2017  we had the following outstanding financial commodity derivatives 



in january 2018 we entered into the following financial commodity derivative contracts 



in the above tables natural gas prices are stated per mcf and crude oil prices are stated per barrel 

as of december 31 2017 we had the following outstanding physical commodity derivatives 



in the table above natural gas prices are stated per mcf 

in january 2018 the company terminated certain physical purchase contracts prior to their settlement date the termination did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as the contracts were previously recognized at fair value 

the amounts set forth in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2017  and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

a significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2018  and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2017  natural gas collars with floor prices of 309  per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 342  to 345   per mcf covered 355  bcf or 5  of natural gas production at an average price of 320  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 517  bcf or 8  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 323  per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 5000  per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 5625  to 5650  per bbl covered 18  mmbbl or 41  of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 5178  per bbl 

we are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments cash and cash equivalents are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in production and reserves even in the current commodity price environment we believe this is attainable by employing disciplined management of our balance sheet and our operations and remaining focused on our core asset base which offers a strategic advantage key components of our business strategy include 

disciplined capital spending focused on organic projects we allocate our capital program to economic projects expected to generate the highest returns maximize our production levels and add to our reserve growth our capital program is developed with the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows with any shortfalls funded primarily by cash on hand andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost repeatable drilling opportunities the price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to achieve the greatest economic benefit from the development our properties 

low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in our core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies using multiwell pad drilling increasing frac stages and drilling longer lateral wells in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure 

conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to provide continued production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with cash on hand borrowings under our revolving credit facility select asset sales access to capital markets or depending on the specific circumstances reductions to our overall level of activity 

pursue strategic marketing and transportation agreements to maximize cash flows and diversify risk we continue to pursue opportunities to maximize our cash flows and diversify our market and customer risk by securing strategic longterm firm transportation and sales contracts in close proximity to our core area of operations   

2017  outlook 

our 2017  drilling program includes approximately 6500 million  in capital expenditures and approximately 700 million  in expected contributions to our equity method investments we expect to fund these expenditures with existing cash operating cash flow and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility see note 4  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade pipeline co llc meade 

in 2017  we plan to drill 95  gross wells  900  net and complete 95  gross wells  900  net of which 51  gross wells  450  net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years we allocate our planned program for capital expenditures among our various operating areas based on market conditions return expectations availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

as a result of higher expected natural gas and crude oil prices we increased our budgeted capital expenditures compared to 2016  we plan to operate an average of approximately 30 rigs in 2017  an increase from an average of approximately 14 rigs in 2016  during 2016  we strategically curtailed production levels in the marcellus shale due to lower price realizations in the region however we expect to increase marcellus shale production during 2017  

description of properties 

our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional plays—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states 

marcellus shale 

our marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 179000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2016  net production in the marcellus shale was 5819  bcfe representing approximately 93 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 5530 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 99 are operated by us 

during 2016  we invested 2661 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 290 net wells completed 630 net wells and turned in line 520 net wells as of december 31 2016  we had 262 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2016  with two drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2017  with two rigs operating 

eagle ford shale 

our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio and la salle counties texas where we hold approximately 84000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2016  our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford shale was 3819 mbbl and 25 bcf respectively or 255 bcfe representing approximately 4 of our total equivalent production as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 2293 net wells in the eagle ford of which approximately 90 are operated by us 

during 2016  we invested 918 million in the eagle ford shale and drilled or participated in drilling 90 net wells completed 130 net wells and turned in line 130 net wells as of december 31 2016  we had 190 net wells that were waiting on completion we exited 2016  with one drilling rig operating in the play and plan to exit 2017  with one rig operating 

other properties 

in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the devonian shale big lime weir and berea formations in west virginia the haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas and the utica shale in pennsylvania 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100  miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems four local distribution companies and numerous end users the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system   

we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia 

acquisitions 

in december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 305 million  total cash consideration paid was 299 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs 

in october 2014 we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for 2100 million  total cash consideration paid at closing was 1852 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs in april 2015 we completed the acquisition of the remaining oil and gas properties for which the seller was unable to obtain consents at closing for 160 million  

divestitures 

in february 2016 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 564 million  and recognized a 05 million  gain on sale of assets 

in october 2014 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for 443 million  and recognized a 199 million  gain on sale of assets 

in december 2013 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles to chaparral energy llc for 1600 million and recognized a 194 million  gain on sale of assets we also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas to a third party for 1234 million and recognized a 175 million  loss on sale of assets 

in 2013 we sold various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties for 443 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million 

in 2012 we sold certain unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for 1693 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts and is subject to seasonal price swings the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states where we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies gas marketers and power generation facilities 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

our crude oil is sold at market sensitive prices under longterm sales contracts the principal markets for our oil are in the south texas refining region where we can market to refineries and oil pipeline customers 

delivery commitments 

we have entered into various firm sales contracts to deliver and sell natural gas we believe we will have sufficient production quantities to meet substantially all of our commitments but may be required to purchase natural gas from third parties to satisfy shortfalls should they occur 

a summary of our firm sales commitments as of december 31 2016  are set forth in the table below 



we utilize a part of our firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas under the majority of these firm sales contracts and have entered into numerous agreements for transportation of our production some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms however we do not believe we have a financial commitment due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these obligations 

risk management 

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2016  natural gas swaps covered 520  bcf or 9  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 251  per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 3800  per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 4710  to 4750  per bbl covered 14  mmbbl or 34  of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 4561  per bbl 

as of december 31 2016  we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 



in the table above natural gas prices are stated per mcf and crude oil prices are stated per barrel 

while we have hedged a portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2017 and beyond any unhedged production is directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



 

 our proved reserves totaled approximately 8576  bcfe at december 31 2016  of which 97 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 5 from 8190  bcfe at december 31 2015  in 2016  we added 6839 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the positive results from our drilling and completion program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net upward revision of 3701  bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 6587 bcfe associated with positive drilling results in our dimock field in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by a downward revisions of 2460 bcfe associated with proved undeveloped pud reserves reclassifications as a result of the five year limitation and 426 bcfe associated with lower commodity prices in 2016  we produced 6271  bcfe 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average natural gas crude oil and ngl index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factorsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our natural gas crude oil and ngl reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our vice president engineering and technology is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of three engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by miller and lents he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 34 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 25 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management 

miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 23 2017 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not retained on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2016  we had 29533  bcfe of pud reserves associated with future development costs of 15 billion which represents a decrease  of 4079  bcfe compared to december 31 2015  approximately 94 of our pud reserves are located in susquehanna county pennsylvania we expect to complete approximately 99 of our pud reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells by the end of 2017 future development plans are reflective of the expected increase in commodity prices and have been established based on cash on hand expected available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  all pud reserves are expected to be drilled and completed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 



 production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which represents more than 15 of our total proved reserves 



 

 acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2016  



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2016  is 78174 34926 and 34306 for the years ending december 31 2017  2018  and 2019  respectively 

we expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options as of december 31 2016  approximately 29 of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our core areas of operation where we currently expect to continue development activities andor extend the lease terms 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2016  this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



 

 drilling activity 

we drilled and completed wells or participated in the drilling and completion of wells as indicated in the table below the information below should not be considered indicative of future performance nor should a correlation be assumed between the number of productive wells drilled quantities of reserves found or economic value 



during the year ended december 31 2016  we completed 62  gross wells  620  net th at were drilled in prior years   

the following table sets forth information about wells for which drilling was in progress or which were drilled but uncompleted at december 31 2016  which are not included in the above table 



  other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  two  customers accounted for approximately 19  and 10  two  customers accounted for approximately 16 and 14 and two  customers accounted for approximately 14 and 10 respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production   

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation   

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or 

gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc’s regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation this maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our wholly‑owned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 18 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petition 

in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 124‑mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date has been impacted by the public regulatory permitting process currently the inservice date for constitution is expected in the second half of 2018 when placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga 

additionally in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20  equity interest in meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga transco filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc on march 31 2015 on february 3 2017 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non‑affiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and 

transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions   

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum   

our sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year re‑determination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index 

pipeline safety regulation   

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and non‑rural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the 

current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in non‑rural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new seven‑year reassessment cycle began during 2013 

in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of one‑call excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all low‑stress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dot’s pipeline safety regulations 

in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remote‑controlled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 including revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure 

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot 

the cost of compliance with dot’s integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance on april 8 2016 the dot’s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend existing integrity management requirements expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt phmsa issued but has yet to publish a similar rule for hazardous liquids pipelines on january 13 2017 that rule extends regulatory reporting requirements to all liquid gathering lines requires additional eventdriven and periodic inspections requires use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines modifies repair criteria and requires certain pipelines to eventually accommodate inline inspection tools it is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect as on january 20 2017 the trump administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the office of the federal register but not yet published be immediately withdrawn for further review 

in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dot’s enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations 

environmental and safety regulations   

general   our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste   we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes for example in december 2016 the epa and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the epa’s alleged failure to timely assess its rcra subtitle d criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra the consent decree requires the epa to propose a rulemaking by march 2019 for revision of certain subtitle d criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act   the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act   the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states 

clean water act   the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act   our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution facilities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in addition the epa has announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act   the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing   many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas   in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered but not enacted legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas and oil that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  approximately 97 of equivalent proved reserves  changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices natural gas prices based on the twelvemonth average of the first of the month henry hub index price were 248 per mmbtu in 2016  compared to 259 per mmbtu in 2015  oil prices based on the nymex monthly average price were 4275 per barrel in 2016  compared to 5028 per barrel in 2015  and have yet to recover to levels experienced in 2014 despite recent price improvements low prices throughout 2015 and 2016 have had and any substantial or extended decline in future natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans see risk factors future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 



these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas and oil prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties the present value of future cash flows are based on 174  per mcf of natural gas 1069  per bbl of ngls and 3754  per bbl of oil as of december 31 2016  actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  

the value of our oil and gas properties depends on prices of natural gas and oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for example in december 2015 we recorded an impairment of approximately 1149 million  associated with oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana  the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 because our reserves are predominately natural gas  approximately 97 of equivalent proved reserves  changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2016  will decrease at a rate of 7 27 19 and 15 during 2017  2018  2019  and 2020  respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 15 billion  of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

 in addition the interest rates that we pay on our senior unsecured notes and the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio and our asset coverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our earnings or the present value of our reserves or decreases in our earnings or the present value of our natural gas and oil reserves without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness will result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if the price that we receive for our natural gas and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default under the ratios described above because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of decreased natural gas and oil prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition  capital resources and liquidity” 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced which could limit us in the future 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 32 billion  and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 18 billion  the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain 

acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower natural gas or oil prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2017  plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2017  plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations 

and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 



 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2016  we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2016  nonoperated wells represented approximately 65 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 19 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition from time to time legislation has been introduced but not enacted in congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if enacted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely 

affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover in may 2014 the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing further in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however in june 2016 a wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule finding that the blm lacked authority to promulgate the rule this decision is currently being appealed by the federal government we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

in addition state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process we cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities in june 2016 the epa published a final rule that updates and expands the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry in addition the epa has announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities the epa also published a final rule in june 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry 

compliance with these requirements especially the new methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business similarly aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and time consuming air permitting particularly in regard to obtaining preconstruction permits the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 though it was later lifted in 2015 and new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state the pennsylvania supreme court heard additional challenges to act 13 and struck several more provisions in september 2016 including the provision requiring notification of spills and leaks only to public water suppliers 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 

delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in june 2016 the epa published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws the regulations were developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices for example the epa conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released its final report in december 2016 it concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions the united states was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change in paris which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement requires countries to review and represent a progression in their nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years the united states signed the paris agreement in april 2016 increased public awareness and concern may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions 

in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa  limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants in october 2015 the epa finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the ghg monitoring and reporting requirements these new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells the revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities also in november 2016 the epa published a final rule adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report ghg emissions resulting from equipment leaks 

federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

cyberattacks targeting our systems or the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure could adversely affect our business 

our business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data computer networks and connected infrastructure we depend on this technology to record and store financial data estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally computers control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the united states which are necessary to transport our products to market 

a cyberattack may involve a hacker a virus malware phishing or other actions for the purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption unauthorized access to our proprietary information could lead to data corruption or communication or operational disruptions a cyberattack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage those assets or the environment delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for transported products 

we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future as cyberattackers become more sophisticated we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyberattacks 

certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

environmental matters 

on november 12 2015 we received a proposed consent order and agreement from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep relating to gas migration allegations in an area surrounding several wells owned and operated by us in susquehanna county pennsylvania the allegations relating to these wells were initially raised by residents in the area   in august 2011 we received a notice of violation from the padep   in september 2011 for failure to prevent the migration of gas into fresh groundwater sources in the area surrounding these wells since then we have been engaged with the padep in investigating the incident and have performed appropriate remediation efforts including the provision of alternative sources of drinking water to affected residents we believe the source of methane has been remediated and we entered into a consent order and agreement with the padep on december 30 2016 we agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of approximately 03 million and to continue to provide alternative sources of drinking water to affected residents until the affected water supplies are permanently restored further the related gas well is being permanently plugged following the plugging of the gas well additional monitoring will be required to ensure the source of methane has been remediated cabot continues to work with the padep to bring this matter to a close 

from time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate relating to alleged violations of environmental statutes or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder while we cannot predict with certainty whether these notices of violation will result in fines andor penalties if fines andor penalties are imposed they may result in monetary sanctions individually or in the aggregate in excess of 100000

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

financial and operating overview 

financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the year ended december 31 2015  are as follows 

 market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials weather conditions and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues location differentials have increased in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude 

oil and condensate revenues refer to results of operations below see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

commodity prices have remained volatile and have improved during the fourth quarter of 2016  compared to the fourth quarter of 2015  but have yet to recover to levels experienced in 2014 in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge 

we believe we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in the current commodity pricing environment and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by 



financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2016  were from funds generated from the sale of common stock the sale of natural gas and oil production and proceeds from the sale of assets these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures including contributions to our equity method investments repayment of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and to repurchase certain of our senior notes interest payments on debt and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

in february 2016 we sold an aggregate of 506 million  shares of common stock at a price of 19675  per share and received 9956 million  in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions these net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repaying indebtedness under our revolving credit facility repurchasing certain of our senior notes 

the borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties effective april 19 2016  our borrowing base was reduced from 34 billion  to 32 billion  the maximum credit amount under the revolving credit facility remained unchanged at 18 billion  however the available commitments were reduced to 16 billion  at the time of redetermination 

in may 2016 we repurchased 640 million  principal amount of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes for approximately 683 million  a 47 million  extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the premium paid and the writeoff of a portion of the related deferred financing costs due to early repayment  as a result of the repurchase of these senior notes the available commitments under the revolving credit facility increased to 17 billion  and remained at that level as of december 31 2016  

a decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt we believe that with the existing cash on hand internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans 

as of december 31 2016  we had no borrowings outstanding and unused commitments of 17 billion  under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2015  we had 4130 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

at december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes see note 5  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows 



operating activities   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively sales of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had a working capital surplus  of 4581 million  and a deficit  of 908 million  respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility available to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2016   decrease d by 3484 million  when compared to 2015  this decrease  was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities and lower  operating revenues partially offset by lower operating expenses excluding noncash expenses the decrease  in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease  in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase  in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decrease d by 21  and 18  respectively for 2016  compared to 2015  equivalent production increase d by 4  for 2016  over 2015  as a result of higher  natural gas production in the marcellus shale partially offset by lower  oil production in the eagle ford shale 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by 4957 million when compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34 and 48 respectively for 2015 compared to 2014 equivalent production volumes increased by 13 for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities   cash flows used in investing activities decrease d by 6401 million  from 2015  to 2016  due to a decrease  of 5804 million  in capital expenditures 163 million   lower  acquisition costs and 428 million   higher  proceeds from the sale of assets 

cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 6715 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease of 5240 million in capital expenditures 1984 million lower acquisition costs and a 90 million decrease in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments these decreases were partially offset by a 318 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and 281 million of changes in restricted cash balances 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increase d by 2267 million  from 2015  to 2016  due to 9953 million  of net proceeds related to the issuance of common stock and lower  capitalized debt issuance costs of 46 million  related to the amendment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes in december 2015 these increase s were partially offset by 7700 million  of higher  net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and 31 million  of higher  dividend payments 

cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 1938 million from 2014 to 2015 due to 3320 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 22 million related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015 these decreases were partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases of 1389 million as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease of 14 million in tax benefits associated with our stockbased compensation 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

 during 2016  and 2015  we paid dividends of 362 million   008  per share and 331 million   008  per share on our common stock respectively 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



 

1 exploration expenditures include 101 million  33 million  and 78 million  of exploratory dry hole expenditures in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

 in 2016 we drilled 40  gross wells  380  net and completed 76  gross wells  760  net of which 62  gross wells  620  net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years in 2017  we plan to drill 95  gross wells  900  net and complete 95  gross wells  900  net of which 51  gross wells  450  net were drilled but uncompleted in prior years our 2017  drilling program includes approximately 6500 million  in total capital expenditures we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  are set forth in the following table 



 



amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2016  was 1337 million  see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and crude oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 004 per mcfe and an increase of 004 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural 

gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 89 million or decrease by approximately 75 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 

contingency reserves 

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see  regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production   natural gas marketing gathering and transportation   federal regulation of swap transactions   federal regulation of petroleum   pipeline safety regulation  and  environmental and safety regulations  in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 125  to 10 which increases back to a ratio of 175 to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 475  to 10 through and including december 31 2016 under the terms of the respective agreements the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 425 to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and 35 to 10 beginning on march 31 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard  poors ratings services sp or moodys investor service inc moodys at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 97 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline furthermore we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar swap and basis swap arrangements to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2016  and 2015  compared 

we reported a net loss  for 2016  of 4171 million  or 091  per share compared to net loss  for 2015  of 1139 million  or 028  per share the increase  in net loss  was primarily due to lower  operating revenues and higher  operating expenses partially offset by a higher  income tax benefit 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





natural gas revenues 

the decrease  in natural gas revenues of 25 million  was due to lower  natural gas prices partially offset by higher  production the increase in production was a result of our drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the decrease  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 971 million  was due to lower  production and crude oil prices the decrease  in production was a result of a decrease in drilling and completion activities in south texas 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 



brokered natural gas 

the 10 million   decrease  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of a decrease  in sales price that outpaced the decrease  in purchase price and lower  brokered volumes 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 2601 million  from 2015  to 2016  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the decrease  in equity method earnings loss is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2016  compared to 2015  

gain loss on sale of assets 

during 2016  we recognized a net aggregate loss  of 19 million  primarily due to the sale of certain of our oil and gas properties in east and south texas during 2015  we recognized a net aggregate gain of 39 million  primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas 

loss on debt extinguishment 

a 47 million  extinguishment loss  was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 related to the premium paid for the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the writeoff of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repayment 

interest expense 

interest expense decrease d 86 million  due to a 55 million decrease resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016 which remained undrawn through december 31 2016  interest expense also decreased 34 million resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes at maturity these decreases were offset by a 06 million increase in commitment fees as a result of an increase in the unused portion of the commitments under our revolving credit facility 

income tax benefit 

income tax benefit increase d 1691 million  due to a higher  pretax loss partially offset by a lower  effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2016  and 2015  were 368  and 392  respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of nonrecurring discrete items recorded during 2016 compared to 2015 

we expect our 2017  effective income tax rate to be approximately 370 however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state tax rates that occur during the year as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers 

2015  and 2014  compared 

we reported a net loss for 2015  of 1139 million  or 028  per share compared to net income for 2014  of 1045 million  or 025  per share the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues higher operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of assets these decreases were partially offset by lower impairments on oil and gas properties 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





 

 natural gas revenues 

the decrease in natural gas revenues of 5656 million was due to lower natural gas prices partially offset by higher production associated with the positive results of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of 657 million was due to lower crude oil prices partially offset by higher production the increase in production was a result of our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 

gain loss on derivative instruments 

effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis changes in fair value and cash settlements of derivative instruments are recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 



brokered natural gas 

the 06 million   decrease  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of lower brokered volumes partially offset by a decrease in purchase price that outpaced the decrease in sales price 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations decrease d by 6292 million  from 2014  to 2015  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 



7710 million related to certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the then current price environments 

 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the increase in equity method earnings loss is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2015 compared to 2014 

gain loss on sale of assets   

during 2015  we recognized a net aggregate gain of 39 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2014 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 171 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas 

interest expense   

interest expense increase d 231 million  due to 241 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of 10 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 17 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 3472 million compared to approximately 4100 million during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

income tax benefit 

income tax benefit increase d 13 million  due to lower pretax income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2015  and 2014  were 392  and 2224  respectively the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activities 

periodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk 

management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2016  we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 

in the above table natural gas prices are stated per mcf and crude oil prices are stated per barrel 

the amounts set forth in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2016  and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

a significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2017  and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2016  natural gas swaps covered 520  bcf or 9  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 251  per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 3800  per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 4710  to 4750  per bbl covered 14  mmbbl or 34  of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 4561  per bbl 

we are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments cash and cash equivalents are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured 

and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in production and reserves we believe this is attainable even in the current commodity price environment by employing a combination of disciplined management and remaining focused on our core asset base which offers a strategic advantage key components of our business strategy include 

disciplined capital spending focused on organic projects we allocate our capital program based on economic projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows with any shortfalls funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost repeatable drilling opportunities the price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our properties 

low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in our core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multiwell pad drilling in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure 

conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices from time to time we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and select asset sales 

pursue strategic marketing and transportation agreements to maximize cash flows and diversify risk we continue to pursue opportunities to maximize our cash flows and diversify our market and customer risk by securing strategic longterm firm transportation and sales contracts in close proximity to our core area of operations   

2016  outlook 

our 2016  drilling program includes approximately 3250 million  in capital expenditures and approximately 1500 million  in expected contributions to our equity method investments we expect to fund these expenditures with operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility see note 4  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade pipeline co llc meade 

we plan to drill approximately 30  gross wells  300  net in 2016  compared to 142  gross wells  1328  net drilled in 2015  we allocate our planned capital program among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly 

as a result of sustained lower natural gas and crude oil prices expected during 2016  we reduced our budgeted capital expenditures compared to 2015 in addition we plan to operate an average of approximately 13 rigs in 2016  a decrease from an average of approximately 54 rigs in 2015  during 2015  we strategically curtailed production levels in the marcellus shale due to lower price realizations in the region and we expect to continue to strategically curtail production during 2016  given the current commodity price environment 

description of properties 

our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional plays—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states 

marcellus shale 

our marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2015  net production in the marcellus shale was 5408  bcfe representing approximately 90 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 5481 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 99 are operated by us 

during 2015  we invested 4570 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 825 net wells and turned in line 640 net wells as of december 31 2015  we had 668 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2015  with two drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2016  with one rig operating 

eagle ford shale 

our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio and la salle counties texas where we hold approximately 85500 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2015  our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford shale was 5797 mbbl and 18 bcf respectively or 366 bcfe representing approximately 6 of our total equivalent production as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 2212 net wells in the eagle ford of which approximately 85 are operated by us 

during 2015  we invested 3034 million in the eagle ford shale and drilled or participated in drilling 493 net wells and turned in line 443 net wells as of december 31 2015  we had 230 net wells that were waiting on completion we exited 2015  with one drilling rig operating in the play and plan to exit 2016  with one rig operating 

other oil and gas properties 

in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the devonian shale big lime weir and berea in west virginia the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas and the utica shale in pennsylvania 

other properties 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100  miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems four local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2015  the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia 

acquisitions 

in december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million  total cash consideration paid was approximately 299 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs 

in october 2014 we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 2100 million  total cash consideration paid at closing was approximately 1852 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs in april 2015 we completed the acquisition of the remaining oil and gas properties for which the seller was unable to obtain consents at closing for approximately 160 million  

divestitures 

in october 2014 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 443 million  and recognized a 199 million  gain on sale of assets 

in december 2013 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles to chaparral energy llc for approximately 1600 million and recognized a 194 million  gain on sale of assets we also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas to a third party for approximately 1234 million and recognized a 175 million  loss on sale of assets 

in 2013 we sold various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties for approximately 443 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million 

in 2012 we sold certain unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately 1693 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million 

in 2011 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately 4055 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 634 million 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers in the gulf coast area we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production 

risk management 

from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2015  natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 386  to 391  per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 427  to 443  per mcf covered 709  bcf or 13  of our natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 387  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1073  bcf or 19  of our natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 379  per mcf 

as of december 31 2015  we did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives in january 2016 we entered into natural gas swaps covering 520  bcf of our expected natural gas production from april 2016  through october 2016  at a weightedaverage price of 251  per mcf a significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2016 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



 

 our proved reserves totaled approximately 8190  bcfe at december 31 2015  of which 96 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 11 from 7401  bcfe at december 31 2014  in 2015  we added 9654 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the positive results from our drilling program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net upward revision of 4256  bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 7029  bcfe associated with positive drilling results in our dimock field in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by a downward revision of 2773  bcfe associated with lower commodity prices in 2015  we produced 6025 bcfe 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factorsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our crude oil and natural gas reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our vice president engineering and technology is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of three engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by miller and lents he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 33 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 24 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management 

miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 26 2016 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2015  we had 33612  bcfe of proved undeveloped pud reserves associated with future development costs of 16 billion which represents an increase of 4629  bcfe compared to december 31 2014  we expect to develop approximately 60 to 70 of our pud reserves over the next three years of which 9374  bcfe have been drilled and are waiting on completion future development plans are reflective of the significant decrease in commodity prices and have been established based on an expectation of available cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015  all pud reserves are expected to be developed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to

production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which represents more than 15 of our total proved reserves 



 

 acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2015  



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2015  is 66586 86252 and 38501 for the years ending december 31 2016  2017  and 2018  respectively 

we expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options as of december 31 2015  approximately 32 of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our core areas of operation where we currently expect to continue development activities andor extend the lease terms 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2015  this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



 

 drilling activity 

we drilled wells or participated in the drilling of wells as indicated in the table below 



at december 31 2015  3 gross 30 net wells were in the process of being drilled 

other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predicted 

price contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place 

major customers 

during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  two  customers accounted for approximately 16  and 14  two customers accounted for approximately 14 and 10 and four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc’s regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our wholly‑owned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 18 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petition 

in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 124‑mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date may still be impacted by the public regulatory permitting process when placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga 

additionally in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20  equity interest in meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga transco filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc on march 31 2015 and is currently seeking various federal and state approvals authorizing construction and operation of the pipeline 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non‑affiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of swap transactions 

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions 

including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless the changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required five‑year re‑determination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2016 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index 

pipeline safety regulation 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and non‑rural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in non‑rural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new seven‑year reassessment cycle began during 2013 

in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of one‑call excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all low‑stress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dot’s pipeline safety regulations 

in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remote‑controlled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and 

report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 including revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure 

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot 

the cost of compliance with dot’s integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance on october 1 2015 the us department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that specifies anomaly and repair timeframes which currently are left entirely to the operator’s discretion the nopr proposes to require that certain repairs be made immediately specifically dents located on the bottom of the pipeline that have any indication of metal loss cracking or a stress riser as well as situations in which the pipeline’s calculated burst pressure is less than 11 times the maximum operating pressure at the location of an anomaly would both be categorized as immediate repair conditions the nopr also proposes to include a general requirement for performing all other repairs within a reasonable time 

in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dot’s enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations 

environmental and safety regulations 

general   our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste   we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be 

designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act   the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act   the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states 

clean water act   the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act   our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of january 1 2015 while these rules remain in effect the epa announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years the epa has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected in december 2014 the epa issued additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in july 2015 the epa finalized two further updates to these rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another referred to as 

connected in parallel in september 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule that would update and expand the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry the epa also issued a proposed rule in september 2015 concerning aggregation of sources that would affect source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act   the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing   many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas   in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read “risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas and oil that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves  changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices natural gas prices based on the twelvemonth average of the first of the month henry hub index price were 259 per mmbtu in 2015 compared to 435 per mmbtu in 2014 and have continued to decline to 219 per mmbtu in february 2016 oil prices based on the nymex monthly average price were 5028 per barrel in 2015 compared to 9499 per barrel in 2014 and have continued to decline to 3178 in january 2016 low prices throughout 2015 have had and any substantial or extended decline in future natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans see risk factorsrecent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 21 

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas and oil prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary 

from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties the present value of future cash flows are based on 181  per mcf of natural gas 1298  per bbl of natural gas liquids and 4710  per bbl of oil as of december 31 2015  actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

recent commodity price declines have resulted in further impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for example in december 2015 we recorded an impairment of approximately 1149 million  associated with oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana  the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 because our reserves are predominately natural gas  approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves  changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash 

flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the future 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2015  will decrease at a rate of 13 27 20 and 16 during 2016  2017  2018  and 2019  respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 20 billion  of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness may 

 in addition the interest rates that we pay on our senior unsecured notes and the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio and our asset coverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our earnings or the present value of our reserves or decreases in our earnings or the present value of 

our natural gas and oil reserves without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness will result in an increase in our interest expense 

our debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if the price that we receive for our natural gas and oil production further deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to further reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default under the ratios described above because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of decreased natural gas and oil prices or a further decline could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditure plan sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition capital resources and liquidity” 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced in light of recent commodity price declines which could limit us in the future 

the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 34 billion  and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 18 billion  the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower natural gas or oil prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2016  plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2016  plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20142016 national enforcement initiative ensuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the 

nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2015  we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2015  nonoperated wells represented approximately 87 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 26 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 28 

 the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover in may 2014 the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing further in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however enforcement of the rule has been delayed pending a decision in a legal challenge in the us district court of wyoming we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves in december 2014 the epa finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage 

tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in july 2015 the epa finalized two updates to the rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another in september 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule that would update and expand the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry the epa also issued a proposed rule in september 2015 concerning aggregation of sources that would affect source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry 

compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements and potential methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business similarly aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and time consuming air permitting particularly in regard to obtaining preconstruction permits the proposed aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 though it was later lifted in 2015 and new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state additional challenges to act 13 are pending before the pennsylvania supreme court however the timing of any decision is uncertain 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in april 2015 the epa published proposed pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a draft report in june 2015 it concluded that activities have not led to widespread systematic impacts on drinking water resources in the united states but there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing could affect drinking water resources this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions for example in november 2014 the obama administration announced an 

agreement with china to voluntarily reduce ghg emissions by 26 to 28 of 2005 levels by 2025 further the united states joined over 190 countries in lima peru in december 2014 and agreed to draft an emissions reduction plan ahead of further international climate negotiations in paris france in 2015 the united states was actively involved in the negotiations in paris which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement will be open for signing on april 22 2016 and will require countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 the paris agreement sets a goal of keeping warming well below 2 degrees celsius and sets a target limit of 15 degrees celsius in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions for example in june 2013 the obama administration announced its climate action plan which among other things directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions including emissions from the oil and gas sector pursuant to this plan the epa issued a proposed rule updating new source performance standards and setting requirements for methane emissions and volatile organic compounds in the oil and gas sector in september 2015 

in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa  limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants 

federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable 

certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

properties and equipment 

the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs are expensed development costs including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves the determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical and engineering data if a well is determined to be successful the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well if a well is determined to be unsuccessful the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the period the determination is made if an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether reserves have been found only as long as i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii drilling of an additional exploratory well is under way or firmly planned for the near future if drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expense 

development costs of proved oil and gas properties including estimated dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the unitsofproduction method using proved developed and proved reserves respectively properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10  to 25 years generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12  to 25 years gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10  to 16 years buildings are depreciated on a straightline basis over 25  to 40 years certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over 3  to 10 years 

costs of retired sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base partial field are charged to accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization if the unitsofproduction rate is not significantly affected a gain or loss if any is recognized only when a group of proved properties entire field that make up the amortization base has been retired abandoned or sold 

the company evaluates its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the companys undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience the companys expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights during 2015  2014  and 2013  amortization associated with the companys unproved properties was 414 million  174 million  and 536 million  respectively and is included in depreciation depletion and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations 

asset retirement obligations 

the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset the asset retirement costs are depreciated using the unitsofproduction method the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells however liabilities are also recorded for meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors at december 31 2015  there were no  assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations 

additional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred accretion expense is included in depreciation depletion and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

the company enters into derivative contracts primarily options and swaps to manage its exposure to price fluctuations on a portion of its anticipated future natural gas and oil production the company’s credit agreement restricts the ability of the company to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which the company has actual or projected exposure or as permitted under the company’s risk management policies and where such derivatives do not subject the company to material speculative risks all of the company’s derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 

all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value at the end of each quarterly period these derivatives are markedtomarket if the derivative does not qualify or is not designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in income if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective 

for derivatives that qualify and are designated as a cash flow hedges the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when a hedging instrument becomes ineffective gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production occurs if the company determines that it is probable that a forecasted hedged transaction will not occur deferred gains or losses on the related hedging instrument are recognized in income immediately 

gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are included in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues gains and losses on derivatives which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivatives not designated or that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activities 

fair value of assets and liabilities 

the company follows the authoritative accounting guidance for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities in its financial statements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of these inputs the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined as follows 

 the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements depending on the particular asset or liability input availability can vary depending on factors such as product type longevity of a product in the market and other particular transaction conditions in some cases certain inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes under the accounting guidance the lowest level that contains significant inputs used in the valuation should be chosen 

revenue recognition 

natural gas and oil sales result from interests in oil and gas properties owned by the company sales of natural gas and oil are recognized when the product is delivered and title transfers to the purchaser payment is generally received one to three months after the sale has occurred 

producer gas imbalances the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue under this method revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances under this method a natural gas imbalance liability is recorded if the companys excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties at the actual price realized upon the gas sale a receivable is recognized only to the extent an imbalance cannot be recouped from the reserves in the underlying properties the company’s aggregate imbalance positions at december 31 2015 and 2014 were not material 

brokered natural gas revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company buys and sells natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions typically with separate counterparties whereby the company andor the counterparty takes title to the natural gas purchased or sold 

income taxes 

the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 

the company is required to make judgments including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the company has taken the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

the company recognizes accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and accrued penalties related to such positions in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

stockbased compensation 

the company accounts for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting under this method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value the company uses either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

the tax benefit for stockbased compensation is included as both a cash outflow from operating activities and a cash inflow from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows the company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the companys income taxes payable 

environmental matters 

environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received 

credit and concentration risk 

substantially all of the companys accounts receivable result from the sale of natural gas and oil and joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and gas industry this concentration of purchasers and joint interest owners may impact the companys overall credit risk either positively or negatively in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions the company does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to nonperformance by the third parties 

during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  two  customers accounted for approximately 16  and 14  two  customers accounted for approximately 14  and 10  and four  customers accounted for approximately 21  16  14  and 11  respectively of the companys total sales the company does not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect because alternative customers are readily available 

use of estimates 

in preparing financial statements the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the most significant estimates pertain to proved natural gas and oil reserves and related cash flow estimates which are used to compute depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved oil and gas properties other significant estimates include natural gas and oil revenues and expenses fair value of derivative instruments estimates of expenses related to legal environmental and other contingencies asset retirement obligations postretirement obligations stockbased compensation and deferred income taxes actual results could differ from those estimates 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 however early adoption is allowed this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented the company elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis and as a result there have been no adjustments made to prior periods the adoption of this guidance only affected the companys financial position and did not have an impact on its results of operations or cash flows 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201515 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements the update provides authoritative guidance for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements noting the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 the company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers as a new topic accounting standards codification topic 606 the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which deferred the effective date of asu no 201409 by one year making the new standard effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 this asu can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption however entities reporting under us gaap are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date for public entities that is no earlier than 2017 for calendar yearend entities the company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on its financial position results of operations or cash flows 

2 acquisitions and divestitures 

acquisitions 

in december 2014 the company completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million  total net cash consideration paid by the company was approximately 299 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs 

in october 2014 the company completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas total net cash consideration paid by the company was approximately 1852 million  which reflects the purchase price of 2100 million  adjusted by approximately 174 million  for properties that the seller was unable to obtain consents for certain leaseholds prior to closing and approximately 74 million  for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs in addition the company also assumed a liability of approximately 12 million  related to asset retirement obligations of the wells acquired in april 2015 the company completed the acquisition of the remaining oil and gas properties for which the seller was unable to obtain consents at closing for approximately 160 million  

the company accounted for these transactions as an asset purchase whereby the identifiable assets acquired were recorded at cost with the respective assigned carrying amount based on the relative fair value of the unproved and proved properties at the acquisition date the fair value measurement of assets acquired was based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent level 3 inputs the fair value of oil and gas properties were measured using discounted future cash flows the discount factor used was based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil significant inputs to the valuation of oil and gas properties include i reserves including risk adjustments for probable and possible reserves ii production rates based on the companys experience with similar properties in which it operates iii estimated future operating and development costs iv future commodity prices v future cash flows and vi a marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate of 100  

divestitures 

the company recognized an aggregate net gain loss on sale of assets of 39 million  171 million  and 214 million  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

in october 2014 the company completed the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east 

texas to a third party for approximately 443 million  and recognized a 199 million  gain on sale of assets 

in december 2013 the company sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles to chaparral energy llc for approximately 1600 million  and recognized a 194 million  gain on sale of assets the company also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas to a third party for approximately 1234 million  and recognized a 175 million  loss on sale of assets 

in 2013 the company sold various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties for approximately 443 million  and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million  

3 properties and equipment net 

properties and equipment net are comprised of the following 



impairment 

in december 2015 the company recorded an impairment of 1149 million  associated with oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana  the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 these fields were reduced to fair value of approximately 899 million  using discounted future cash flows 

in december 2014 the company recorded a 7710 million  impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment these fields were reduced to fair value of approximately 865 million  using discounted future cash flows 

the fair value of the impaired fields was based on significant inputs that were not observable in the market and are considered to be level 3 inputs as defined by asc 820 refer to note 1  for a description of fair value hierarchy key assumptions included i reserves including risk adjustments for probable and possible reserves ii production rates based on the companys experience with similar properties in which it operates iii estimated future operating and development costs iv future commodity prices v future cash flows and vi a marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate of 10  at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively

the following table reflects the net changes in capitalized exploratory well costs 



the following table provides an aging of capitalized exploratory well costs based on the date the drilling was completed 



4 equity method investments 

the company has two  equity method investments constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade pipeline co llc meade which are further described below activity related to these equity method investments is as follows   



constitution pipeline company llc 

in april 2012 the company acquired a 25  equity interest in constitution which was formed to develop construct and operate a 124  mile large diameter pipeline to transport natural gas from northeast pennsylvania to both the new england and new york markets under the terms of the agreement the company agreed to invest its proportionate share of costs associated with the development and construction of the pipeline and related facilities subject to a contribution cap of 250 million  the expected inservice date for the new pipeline is the fourth quarter of 2016 however this estimate is contingent on the timely issuance of remaining outstanding permits the company expects to contribute approximately 1390 million  over the next two years  

meade pipeline co llc 

in february 2014 the company acquired a 20  equity interest in meade which was formed to participate in the development and construction of a 177 mile pipeline central penn line that will transport natural gas from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc’s transco mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the new pipeline will be constructed and operated by transco and will be owned by transco and meade in proportion to their respective ownership percentages of approximately 61  and 39  respectively under the terms of the meade llc agreement the company agreed to invest its proportionate share of meade’s anticipated costs associated with the new pipeline the company expects to contribute approximately 1302 million  over the next two years  the expected inservice date for the new pipeline is scheduled for the second half of 2017 

5 debt and credit agreements 

the companys debt and credit agreements consisted of the following 



the company has debt maturities of 200 million  due in 2016 3120 million  due in 2018 and 1000 million  due in 2020 in addition the revolving credit facility matures in 2020  no other tranches of debt are due within the next five years 

at december 31 2015  the company was in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as amended for both its revolving credit facility and senior notes 

senior notes 

the company has various issuances of senior notes interest on each of the senior notes is payable semiannually under the terms of the various senior note agreements the company may prepay all or any portion of the notes of each series on any date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a makewhole premium 

due to the significant decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of the companys financial covenants effective december 31 2015 the company amended the agreements governing its senior notes to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant as further described below the amended agreements provide that the asset coverage ratio present value of proved reserves to debt as defined in the agreements be calculated based on the present value of proved reserves before income taxes whereas prior to these amendments the present value was calculated after income taxes the minimum asset coverage ratio was also reduced from 175  to 10 to 125  to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and increases back to the preamended ratio of 175  to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and thereafter the amendments also introduce a leverage ratio covenant which is defined in the agreement as the ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax the leverage ratio may not exceed a maximum ratio of 

• 475  to 10 through and including december 31 2016 

• 425  to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and 

 in addition the amendments provide for potential increases to the original coupon rates ranging from 0  to 125  basis points depending on the asset coverage and leverage ratios at the end of the respective quarterly period as defined in the note agreements these potential increases lapse when the company maintains a leverage ratio between 30  to 10 for two  consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or after december 31 2017 or receives an investment grade rating by sp or moodys as of december 31 2015 based on the companys asset coverage and leverage ratios there were no  interest rate adjustments required for the companys senior notes 

the note agreements continue to include a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four  quarters of 28  to 10 which was unchanged by the amendments there are also various other covenants customarily found in such debt instruments the notes are also subject to customary events of default

tsr performance share awards the tsr performance share awards granted are earned or not earned based on the comparative performance of the companys common stock measured against a predetermined group of companies in the companys peer group over a three year performance period 

the following table is a summary of activity for the tsr performance share awards 



 

1 the grant date fair value figures in this table represent the fair value of the equity component of the performance 

      share awards 

the current portion of the liability included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015  and 2014  was 18 million  and 70 million  respectively the noncurrent portion of the liability for the tsr performance share awards included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015  and 2014  was 09 million  and 40 million  respectively the company made cash payments during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  of 70 million  and 143 million  respectively there were no  cash payouts during 2013  associated with the tsr performance share awards 

the following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value of the equity component of the tsr performance share awards for the respective periods 



the following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the liability component of the tsr performance share awards for the respective periods 



the stock price volatility was calculated using historical closing stock price data for the company for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award the risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the us treasury nominal 10 within the expected term as measured on the grant date the expected dividend percentage assumes that the company will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter 

other information 

compensation expense recorded for both the equity and liability components of all performance share awards for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  was 183 million  208 million  and 309 million  respectively total unamortized compensation expense related to the equity component of performance shares at december 31 2015  was 184 million  and will be recognized over the next 10 years  

as of december 31 2015  the aggregate intrinsic value for all performance share awards was 359 million  and was calculated by multiplying the closing market price of the companys stock on december 31 2015  by the number of unvested performance share awards outstanding as of december 31 2015  the weighted average remaining contractual term of unvested performance share awards outstanding was approximately 11 years  

on december 31 2015  the performance period ended for two  types of performance share awards that were granted in 2013  for the employee performance share awards the calculation of the three year average of the three internal performance metrics was completed in the first quarter of 2016  and was certified by the compensation committee in february 2016  as the company achieved the three  performance metrics 340960  shares with a grant date fair value of 91 million  were issued in february 2016  for the tsr performance share awards 254980  shares with a grant date fair value of 59 million  were issued in addition to a cash payment of 18 million  based on the companys ranking relative to a predetermined peer group the calculation of the award payout was certified by the compensation committee on january 5 2016  

supplemental employee incentive plan 

the supplemental employee incentive plan the plan adopted by the companys board of directors is intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for fulltime nonofficer employees by providing for cash payments in the event the companys common stock reaches a specified trading price the compensation committee can increase any of the payments as applied to any employee if desired any deferred portion will only be paid if the participant is employed by the company or has terminated employment by reason of retirement death or disability as provided in the plan payments are subject to certain other restrictions contained in the plan 

the plan currently provides for a payout if the closing price per share of the companys common stock for any 20  trading days out of any 60 days  consecutive trading days equals or exceeds an interim price goal per share within two years  of the effective date of the plan interim trigger date or a final price goal per share within four years  of the effective date of the plan final trigger date under the plan and upon approval by the compensation committee each eligible employee may receive a distribution of 20  of base salary if the interim trigger is met or 50  of base salary if the final trigger is met or an incremental 30  of base salary if the interim trigger was previously achieved in accordance with the plan in the event either the interim or final trigger date occurs within the first 30 months from the effective date 25 of the total distribution will be paid immediately and the remaining 75 will be deferred and paid at a future date as described in the plan for final trigger dates occurring during the last 18 months but before the end of the plan total distribution will be paid immediately   

the plan is accounted for as a liability award under the authoritative accounting guidance for stockbased compensation and is valued as of the end of each reporting period on a marktomarket basis using a monte carlo simulation model in addition to the expected value of plan payouts the simulation technique also generates an expected trigger date for the two types of payments made under this plan which is used to determine the requisite service period the company recognized compensation expense benefit of 03 million  30 million  and 115 million  for years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively related to the plan the company made payments of 130 million  under the plan for year ended december 31 2014  

seip iii on may 1 2012 the companys board of directors adopted the supplemental employee incentive plan iii seip iii to replace the supplemental employee incentive plan ii with an effective date of july 1 2013 the seip iii provided for a payout under the plan if the closing price per share of the companys common stock equals or exceeds the price goal of 2500  per share by june 30 2014 interim trigger date or 3750  per share by june 30 2016 final trigger date 

on february 11 2013 the company achieved the price goal of 2500  per share prior to the interim trigger date accordingly a total distribution of approximately 68 million  was earned by the companys eligible employees under the plan of which 25  of the total distribution or 17 million  was paid in february 2013 and the remaining 75  or 49 million  was paid in august 2014 in accordance with the seip iii 

on august 27 2013 the company achieved the price goal of 3750  per share prior to the final trigger date accordingly a total distribution of approximately 111 million  was earned by the companys eligible employees under the plan of which 25  of the total distribution or 28 million  was paid in september 2013 and the remaining 75  or 81 million  was paid in august 2014 in accordance with the seip iii 

seip iv on september 19 2013 the companys board of directors adopted the supplemental employee incentive plan iv seip iv to replace the seip iii with an effective date of october 1 2013 the seip iv provides for a payout under the plan if the closing price per share of the companys common stock equals or exceeds the price goal of 5500  per share by september 30 2015 interim trigger date or 8000  per share by september 30 2017 final trigger date there were no  amounts paid with respect to the interim trigger date as the companys common stock did not equal or exceed the respective interim price goal of 5500  per share 

the following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the seip iv liabilities at the end of the respective periods 



deferred performance shares 

as of december 31 2015  534174 shares of the companys common stock representing vested performance share awards were deferred into the deferred compensation plan no  shares were sold out of the plan in 2015  during 2015  a decrease to the deferred compensation liability of 64 million  was recognized which represents the decrease in the closing price of the companys shares held in the trust during the period the decrease in compensation expense was included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

14 earnings per common share 

basic earnings per share eps is computed by dividing net income by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted eps is similarly calculated except that the common shares outstanding for the period is increased using the treasury stock method to reflect the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock appreciation rights were exercised and stock awards were vested at the end of the applicable period 

the following is a calculation of basic and diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding

oil and gas reserves 

users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 

estimates of total proved reserves at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were based on studies performed by the companys petroleum engineering staff the estimates were computed using the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the respective year the estimates were audited by miller and lents ltd miller and lents who indicated that based on their investigation and subject to the limitations described in their audit letter they believe the results of those estimates and projections were reasonable in the aggregate 

no major discovery or other favorable or unfavorable event after december 31 2015  is believed to have caused a material change in the estimates of proved or proved developed reserves as of that date 

the following tables illustrate the companys net proved reserves including changes and proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves for the periods indicated as estimated by the companys engineering staff all reserves are located within the continental united states 



 

 

 capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities 

capitalized costs relating to oil and gas producing activities and related accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization were as follows 



costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition exploration and development activities 

costs incurred in property acquisition exploration and development activities were as follows 



standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves 

the following information has been developed based on natural gas and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by the companys engineering staff it can be used for some comparisons but should not be the only method used to evaluate the company or its performance further the information in the following table may not represent realistic assessments of future cash flows nor should the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows standardized measure be viewed as representative of the current value of the company 

the company believes that the following factors should be taken into account when reviewing the following information 

 96 

under the standardized measure future cash inflows were estimated by using the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year 

the average prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials related to proved reserves are as follows 



in the above table natural gas prices are stated per mcf and crude oil and ngl prices are stated per barrel 

future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development and production costs based on year end costs to arrive at net cash flow before tax future income tax expense was computed by applying year end statutory tax rates to future pretax net cash flows less the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to oil and gas operations the applicable accounting standards require the use of a 10 discount rate 

management does not solely use the following information when making investment and operating decisions these decisions are based on a number of factors including estimates of proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of anticipated economic conditions 

standardized measure is as follows

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

operating overview 

operating results for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the year ended december 31 2014  are as follows 

 market conditions and commodity prices 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by weather conditions pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our derivative and hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues location differentials have increased in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will likely experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

commodity prices continued to decline during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the continued decline in commodity prices we tested the recoverability of the carrying value of all of our oil and gas properties and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 1149 million  associated with certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana  based on the results of our impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas 

properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be required 

we believe we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in the lower commodity pricing environment and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by 

 financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2015  were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures including contributions to our equity method investments interest payments on debt and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

effective april 17 2015  we amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date from may 2017 to april 2020 and to change the mechanism under which interest rate margins are determined for outstanding borrowings the revolving credit facility as amended provides for a borrowing base of 34 billion  and commitments of 18 billion  the amended credit facility also provides for an accordion feature which allows us to increase the available credit line up to an additional 500 million if one or more of the existing or new banks agree to provide such increased amount the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties 

due to the significant decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants effective december 31 2015 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant in addition the amendments to our senior notes provide for potential increases in coupon rates ranging from 0  to 125  basis points depending on the asset coverage and leverage ratios at the end of the respective quarterly period in addition the amendment to our revolving credit facility increased the maximum margins we pay on borrowings under the credit facility see note 5  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the amendments 

as a result of the recent decline in commodity prices our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility could be reduced in the future unless commodity prices continue to decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had 4130 million  and 1400 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility respectively as of december 31 2015  we had unused commitments of 14 billion  under our revolving credit facility 

we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as amended for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes as of december 31 2015  see note 5  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt 

cash flows 

our cash flows from operations investing activities and financing activities are as follows 



operating activities   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital spending 

our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had working capital deficits of 908 million  and 856 million  respectively we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2015   decrease d by 4957 million  when compared to 2014  this decrease  was primarily due to lower  operating revenues and higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the decrease  in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease  in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase  in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decrease d by 34  and 48  respectively for 2015  compared to 2014  equivalent production volumes increase d by 13  for 2015  over 2014  as a result of higher  natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher  oil production in the eagle ford shale 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 increased by 2119 million over 2013 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and an increase in working capital the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 29 for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher natural gas in the marcellus shale and oil production in the eagle ford shale average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 8 and 12 respectively for 2014 compared to 2013 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

investing activities   cash flows used in investing activities decrease d by 6715 million  from 2014  to 2015  due to a decrease  of 5240 million  in capital expenditures 1984 million   lower  acquisition costs and a 90 million   decrease  in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments these decreases were partially offset by a 318 million   decrease  in proceeds from the sale of assets and 281 million  of changes in restricted cash balances 

cash flows used in investing activities increased by 7466 million from 2013 to 2014 due to an increase of 2849 million in capital expenditures a decrease of 2840 million in proceeds from the sale of assets a 2147 million increase in acquisition expenditures related to the acquisitions of eagle ford shale assets that closed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a 192 million increase in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments partially offsetting the increases was a 562 million decrease in restricted cash related to the release of funds by our qualified intermediary due to a lapse in the statutory holding period and the funding of oil and gas lease acquisitions during 2014 associated with likekind exchange transactions pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities decrease d by 1938 million  from 2014  to 2015  due to 3320 million  of lower  net borrowings and an increase  in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 22 million  related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015 these decreases were partially offset by lower  treasury stock repurchases 

of 1389 million  as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease  of 14 million  in tax benefits associated with our stockbased compensation 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 5396 million from 2013 to 2014 due to 5450 million of higher net borrowings and a decrease in share repurchases of 258 million partially offset by a decrease of 203 million in tax benefits associated with our stockbased compensation an 80 million increase in dividends paid and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 29 million 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

 in 2015  we did not repurchase any shares of common stock for the year ended december 31 2014  we repurchased 43 million shares for a total cost of 1389 million during 2015  and 2014  we also paid dividends of 331 million   008  per share and 333 million   008  per share on our common stock respectively 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year in 2015 capital expenditures exceeded our cash flow from operations requiring us to fund a portion of our capital expenditures through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



 

1 exploration expenditures include 33 million  78 million  and 04 million  of exploratory dry hole expenditures in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

we plan to drill approximately 30  gross wells  300  net in 2016  compared to 142  gross wells  1328  net drilled in 2015  in 2016  our drilling program includes approximately 3250 million  in total capital expenditures we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital 

expenditures accordingly due to the current commodity price environment our overall capital spending in 2016  is expected to be lower than our expenditures in 2015  

contractual obligations 

we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  are set forth in the following table 



 

 amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2015  was 1456 million  see note 8  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and crude oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisions 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 004 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future based on the results of our impairment test of all of our oil and gas properties and the resulting impairment charge of approximately 1149 million  in the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be required 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life 

decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 105 million or decrease by approximately 80 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

our financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices both nymex and basis differentials 

income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties 

we believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realized 

our effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 

contingency reserves 

a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 however early adoption is allowed this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented we elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis and as a result there have been no adjustments made to prior periods the adoption of this guidance only affected our financial position and did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201515 presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lineofcredit arrangements the update provides authoritative guidance for debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements noting the sec staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers as a new topic accounting standards codification topic 606 the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in august 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which deferred the effective date of asu no 201409 by one year making the new standard effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 this asu can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption however entities reporting under us gaap are not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than the original effective date for public entities that is no earlier than 2017 for calendar yearend entities we are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 other issues and contingencies 

regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of swap transactions federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments due to the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants effective december 31 2015 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 125  to 10 which increases back to the preamended ratio of 175 to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 475  to 10 through and including december 31 2016 under the terms of the respective agreements the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 425 to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and 35 to 10 beginning on march 31 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard  poors ratings services sp or moodys investor service inc moodys at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline furthermore we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2015  and 2014  compared 

we reported a net loss  for 2015  of 1139 million  or 028  per share compared to net income for 2014  of 1045 million  or 025  per share the decrease  in net income was primarily due to lower  operating revenues higher  operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain  on sale of assets these decreases were partially offset by lower  impairments on oil and gas properties 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





 

 natural gas revenues 

the decrease  in natural gas revenues of 5656 million  was due to lower  natural gas prices partially offset by higher  production associated with the positive results of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the decrease  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 657 million  was due to lower  crude oil prices partially offset by higher  production the increase  in production was a result of our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 

gain loss on derivative instruments 

effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis changes in fair value and cash settlements of derivative instruments are recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 



brokered natural gas 

the 06 million   decrease  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of lower  brokered volumes partially offset by a decrease  in purchase price that outpaced the decrease  in sales price 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations decrease d by 6292 million  from 2014  to 2015  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 48 

 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the increase in equity method earnings loss is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2015  compared to 2014  

gain loss on sale of assets 

during 2015  we recognized a net aggregate gain  of 39 million  primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2014  we recognized a net aggregate gain  of 171 million  primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas 

interest expense 

interest expense increase d 231 million  due to 241 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of 10 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 17 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 3472 million  compared to approximately 4100 million  during 2015  and 2014  respectively 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax benefit increase d 13 million  due to lower  pretax income partially offset by a higher  effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2015  and 2014  were 392  and 2224  respectively the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014 

we expect our 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 370 however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state tax rates that occur during the year as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers 

2014  and 2013  compared 

we reported net income for 2014  of 1045 million  or 025  per share compared to net income for 2013  of 2798 million  or 067  per share the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase in operating revenues and lower income taxes 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





 

 natural gas revenues 

the increase  in natural gas revenues of 1854 million  is due to higher production partially offset by lower natural gas prices the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain noncore asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 225 million  is due to higher production partially offset by lower crude oil prices the increase in production was a result of our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas partially offset by lower production associated with certain noncore asset dispositions in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013 

gain loss on derivative instruments 

effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis changes in fair value are recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations gain loss on derivative instruments includes an 817 million gain related to the change in fair value of realized cash settlements of derivative instruments previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and a 1376 million unrealized marktomarket gain on our commodity derivative instruments 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 



brokered natural gas 

the 21 million   decrease  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of lower brokered volumes and an increase in purchase price that outpaced the increase in sales price 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 8699 million  from 2013  to 2014  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 earnings loss on equity method investments 

the increase in equity method earnings loss is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013 

gain loss on sale of assets   

during 2014  we recognized a net aggregate gain of 171 million  primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2013 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a gain of 195 million 

interest expense   

interest expense increase d 77 million  as a result of an increase in interest expense of 97 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 higher commitment fees of 23 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of 11 

million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 31 million due to the repayment of 750 million of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes in july 2013 and 11 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 4100 million  compared to approximately 4544 million  during 2014 and 2013 respectively 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense decrease d 2778 million  due to lower pretax income and a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were 2224  and 424  respectively the overall effective tax rate was lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activities 

periodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar and swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2015  we did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives in january 2016 we entered into natural gas swaps covering 520  bcf of our expected natural gas production from april 2016  through october 2016  at a weightedaverage price of 251  per mcf a significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2016 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable 

during 2015  natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 386  to 391  per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 427  to 443  per mcf covered 709  bcf or 13  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 387  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1073  bcf or 19  of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 379  per mcf 

we are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk 

of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments cash and cash equivalents are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves we believe this is attainable through a combination of disciplined management and our core asset base that offers a strategic advantage for continued growth key components of our business strategy include 

disciplined capital spending focused on organic projects we allocate our capital program based on projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth at attractive returns our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows with any shortfalls funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost repeatable drilling opportunities 

low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in these core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multiwell pad drilling in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure 

conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and select asset sales 

expand our unconventional resource initiatives we will continue to evaluate opportunities that generate value and contribute to our growth initiatives including new exploration concepts and ideas that if successful can match the size scope and rate of returns of our existing core assets we will also consider the use of joint venture arrangements to achieve these objectives 

2015  outlook 

in 2015  we plan to spend approximately 9000 million  on capital and exploration activities we plan to drill approximately 125  gross wells or 1150  net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we expect to allocate approximately 59 of our 2015  capital program to the marcellus shale approximately 39 to our oilfocused play in the eagle ford shale and the remaining 2 to other emerging plays and nondrilling expenditures due to the weak commodity price environment our overall capital and exploration spending in 2015 is expected to be lower than our expenditures in 2014 

incremental to our capital and exploration expenditures program we also expect to contribute approximately 698 million  to our equity method investments to fund costs associated with the development and construction of two natural gas pipelines in northeast pennsylvania see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade pipeline co llc meade 

description of properties 

our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional plays—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental united states 

marcellus shale 

our marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county and to a lesser extent wyoming county pennsylvania we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2014  net production in the marcellus shale was 4798 bcfe representing approximately 90 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 4690 net wells in the marcellus shale the majority of which are operated by us 

during 2014  we invested 9795 million in the marcellus shale and drilled 1144 net horizontal wells and turned in line 970 net wells as of december 31 2014  we had 473 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2014  with six drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2015 with three rigs operating 

eagle ford shale 

our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio and la salle counties texas where we hold approximately 89000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2014 our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford shale was 3799 mbbl and 15 bcf respectively or 243 bcfe representing approximately 5 of our full year total equivalent production as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 1672 net wells in the eagle ford 

during 2014 we invested 5424 million excluding acquisitions in the eagle ford shale and drilled or participated in drilling 612 net wells we also expanded our position in the play with the acquisition of certain proved and unproved properties for cash consideration of approximately 2147 million  we exited 2014  with four drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2015 with one rig operating 

other oil and gas properties 

in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the utica shale in pennsylvania the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas and the devonian shale big lime weir and berea in west virginia 

other properties 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and four local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2014  the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia 

acquisitions 

in december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million  subject to post closing adjustments total cash consideration paid as of the closing date was approximately 296 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs 

in october 2014 we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 2100 million  total cash consideration paid as of the closing date was approximately 1852 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments an adjustment for consents that the seller was unable to obtain for certain leaseholds prior to closing and acquisition costs 

divestitures 

in october 2014 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 443 million  and recognized a 199 million  gain on sale of assets 

in december 2013 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles to chaparral energy llc for approximately 1600 million and recognized a 194 million  gain on sale of assets we also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas to a third party for approximately 1234 million and recognized a 175 million  loss on sale of assets 

in 2013 we sold various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties for approximately 443 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million 

in december 2012 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas to a private company for 299 million and recognized an 182 million loss on sale of assets 

in june 2012 we sold a 35 nonoperated working interest associated with certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas to a whollyowned subsidiary of osaka gas co ltd for 1250 million and recognized a 670 million gain on sale of assets 

in 2012 we sold various other unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately 144 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 18 million 

in 2011 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately 4055 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 634 million 

in 2010 we various other proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately 1822 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 656 million 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system in the gulf coast area we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or through the use of purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production or obtain favorable prices 

risk management 

from time to time we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2014  natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 360  to 437  per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 422  to 480  per mcf covered 3368  bcf or 66  of our natural gas production at an average price of 437  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1022  bcf or 20  of our natural gas production at an average price of 406  per mcf crude oil swaps covered 612  mbbl or 17  of our crude oil production at an average price 9700  per bbl 

as of december 31 2014  we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 



in the above table natural gas prices are stated per mcf 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



 

 our proved reserves totaled approximately 7401  bcfe at december 31 2014  of which 96 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 36 from 5454  bcfe at december 31 2013  in 2014  we added 19106 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the positive results from our drilling program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we also had a net upward revision of 4930  bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 4921  bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania and an upward revision of 09  bcfe associated with commodity pricing in 2014  we produced 5318 bcfe and purchased 770 bcfe associated with the acquisitions of oil and gas properties in south texas 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and “risk factorsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize various traditional methods to estimate our crude oil and natural gas reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however the seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our vice president engineering and technology is the technical person responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of three engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by our independent third party engineers he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 32 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 23 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management including the chairman president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer for approval 

miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated february 2 2015 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2014  we had 28983  bcfe of proved undeveloped pud reserves associated with future development costs of 22 billion which represents an increase of 6725 bcfe compared to december 31 2013  as of december 31 2014  all proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to

 production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and oil including ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which contains more than 15 of our total proved reserves 



 

 acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2014  



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2014  is 91697 68012 and 87350 for the years ending december 31 2015  2016  and 2017  respectively 

we expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options as of december 31 2014  approximately 34 of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our core areas of operation where we currently expect to continue development activities andor extend the lease terms 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2014  this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



 

 drilling activity 

we drilled wells or participated in the drilling of wells as indicated in the table below 



at december 31 2014  17 gross 148 net wells were in the process of being drilled 

other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made 

prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources 

major customers 

during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  two  customers accounted for approximately 14  and 10  four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 and three customers accounted for approximately 18 12 and 10 respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc’s regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our wholly‑owned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 26 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petition 

in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 124‑mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date may still be impacted by the public regulatory permitting process if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga 

additionally in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20  equity interest in meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga transco currently plans to file an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc during second quarter 2015 however the timing of that filing is subject to transco’s timely completion of the ferc prefiling process and therefore could change   

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the large‑scale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non‑affiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation‑related services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the dodd‑frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd‑frank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are 

executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an end‑user exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless the changes to the swap market as a result of dodd‑frank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the dodd‑frank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which annual adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required five‑year re‑determination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 should be the oil pricing index for the five‑year period beginning july 1 2011 the result of indexing is a “ceiling rate” for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file cost‑of‑service based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipeline’s rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index 

pipeline safety regulation 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and non‑rural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in non‑ rural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new seven‑year reassessment cycle began during 2013 

in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of one‑call excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all low‑stress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dot’s pipeline safety regulations 

in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remote‑controlled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure 

safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 aside from rules contained in the act which include revisions to dot’s civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure the dot has not yet promulgated any new regulations required by the act although it is anticipated that the dot will propose new regulations in early 2015 in january 2015 it was announced as part of a broad plan to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector that phmsa will propose pipeline safety standards in 2015 that will result in reduced methane emissions 

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot 

the cost of compliance with dot’s integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dot’s enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations

general   our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste   we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of 

or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act   the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act   the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states 

clean water act   the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act   our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

some of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and gas production transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of january 1 2015 while these rules remain in effect the epa announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years the epa has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected in december 2014 the epa issued finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements further in 2012 seven states sued the epa to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources is appropriate and if so to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources in april 2014 the epa released a set of five white papers analyzing methane emissions from the industry and based on responses received in january 2015 announced plans to propose a rule governing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry in 2015 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for 

noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities 

safe drinking water act   the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing   many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read “risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays” in item 1a 

greenhouse gas   in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read “risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce” in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations   we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community right‑ to‑know regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and crude oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices natural gas prices based on the first of the month henry hub index price were 430 per mmbtu in december 2014 and have continued to decline to 287 per mmbtu in february 2015 while oil prices based on the nymex monthly average price were 5929 per barrel in december 2014 and have continued to decline to 4733 per barrel in january 2015 substantial or extended decline in prices in the future would have a negative impact on our oil and gas reserves and financial results see recent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 20 

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and crude oil if natural gas and crude oil prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to scale back our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

recent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for example in december 2014 we recorded a 7710 million  impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment because our reserves are predominately natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the future 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2014  will increase at a rate of 9 during 2015  and then decline at estimated rates of 36 23 and 17 during 2016  2017  and 2018  respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2015  plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2015  plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available 

in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20142016 national enforcement initiative ensuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process 

which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2014  we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2014  nonoperated wells represented approximately 92 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 32 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could 

have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover in may 2014 the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing further in may 2013 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves in december 2014 the epa finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in january 2015 the epa announced plans to propose a rule in summer 2015 governing methane emissions from oil and natural gas completion operations 

compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 and new york announced the intention to create a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in december 2014 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania 

department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids on december 19 2013 the pennsylvania supreme court struck down as unconstitutional portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules the remaining challenges to act 13 were remanded to the state commonwealth court which dismissed those challenges in july 2014 this could result in additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2015 the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in early 2015 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions for example in november 2014 the obama administration announced an agreement with china to voluntarily reduce ghg emissions to 26 to 28 of 2005 levels by 2025 further the united states joined over 190 countries in lima peru in december 2014 and agreed to draft an emissions reduction plan ahead of further international climate negotiations in paris france in 2015 in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions for example in june 2013 the obama administration announced its climate action plan which among other things directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions including emissions from the oil and gas sector pursuant to this plan the epa announced in january 2015 a plan to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector 

in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa  limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants 

federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable 

certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

on an equivalent basis our production in 2014  increased by 29  from 2013  we produced 5318 bcfe or 15  bcfe per day in 2014  compared to 4136  bcfe or 11  bcfe per day in 2013  natural gas production increase d by 1138  bcf or 29  to 5080  bcf in 2014  compared to 3942  bcf in 2013  this increase  was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain noncore asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia crude oilcondensatengl production increased  by 07  mbbls or 23  from 32  mmbbls in 2013  to 40  mmbbls in 2014  this increase  was the result of higher production resulting from our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas partially offset by lower production associated with certain noncore asset dispositions in oklahoma in the fourth quarter of 2013 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2014  was 328  per mcf 8  lower than the 356  per mcf price realized in 2013  our average realized crude oil price for 2014  was 8850  per bbl 12  lower than the 10113  per bbl price realized in 2013  these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 

commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

in december 2014 we recorded a 7710 million  impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment 

effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments we will likely experience volatility in our earnings from time to time due to commodity price volatility refer to “impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues” below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

we drilled 200  gross wells  1765  net with a success rate of 995  in 2014  compared to 181  gross wells  1535  net with a success rate of 983  in 2013  our 2014  total capital and exploration spending was approximately 16 billion  excluding the eagle ford shale acquisitions discussed below compared to 12 billion  in 2013  the increase  in capital spending was the result of our drilling programs in the marcellus shale and eagle ford shale we allocate our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources 

our 2015  drilling program includes approximately 9000 million  in capital and exploration expenditures and approximately 698 million  in expected contributions to our equity method investments these expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million  and paid total cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately 296 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs the acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

in october 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 2100 million  and paid total net cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately 1852 million  which reflects the purchase price and adjustments of approximately 174 million  for consents that the seller was unable to obtain for certain leaseholds prior to closing and approximately 80 million  for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs the acquisition was funded with proceeds from the private placement of senior unsecured fixed rate notes completed in september 2014 

in october 2014 we completed the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 443 million  total cash consideration received by the company as of the closing date was approximately 428 million  which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2014  were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production the issuance of fixed rate notes and proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties during the year these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and related interest payments share repurchases and the payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences and demand however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by the variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 



operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities in 2014   increase d by 2119 million  over 2013  this increase  was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and an increase in working capital the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased  by 29  for 2014  compared to 2013  as a result of higher  natural gas and oil production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decrease d by 8  and 12  respectively for 2014  compared to 2013  

net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by 3724 million over 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 55 for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 3 and less than 1 respectively for 2013 compared to 2012 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods 

investing activities   cash flows used in investing activities increase d by 7466 million  from 2013  to 2014  due to a 2849 million   increase  in capital and exploration expenditures a decrease  of 2840 million  in proceeds from the sale of assets a 2147 million   increase  in acquisition expenditures related to the acquisitions of eagle ford shale assets that closed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a 192 million   increase  in capital contributions associated with our equity investments partially offsetting the increases was a 562 million   decrease  in restricted cash related to the release of funds by our qualified intermediary due to a lapse in the statutory holding period and the funding of oil and gas lease acquisitions during 2014  associated with likekind exchange transactions pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code 

cash flows used in investing activities increased by 1527 million from 2012 to 2013 due to a 2668 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures and a 120 million increase associated with our equity investment in constitution these increases were partially offset by a net 1261 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets a portion of which was retained in a qualified intermediary and recognized as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increase d by 5396 million  from 2013  to 2014  due to 5450 million  of higher  net borrowings and a decrease  in share repurchases of 258 million  partially offset by a decrease  of 203 million  in tax benefits associated with our stockbased compensation an 80 million   increase  in dividends paid and an increase  in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 29 million  

cash flows used in financing activities increased by 2279 million from 2012 to 2013 due to 1646 million of stock repurchases 770 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in dividends paid of 85 million partially offset by an 189 million increase in the tax benefit associated with our stock‑based compensation and a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 23 million 

in september 2014 we completed a private placement of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 consisting of amounts due in 2021 2024 and 2026 

effective april 15 2014 the lenders under our revolving credit facility approved an increase in our borrowing base from 23 billion  to 31 billion  as part of the annual redetermination under the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement the commitments under the revolving credit facility remain unchanged at 14 billion  see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

at december 31 2014  we had 1400 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 24  compared to 4600 million  of borrowings outstanding at a weightedaverage interest rate of 20  at december 31 2013  as of december 31 2014  we had 13 billion  available for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit facility and fixed rate notes as of december 31 2014  

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow existing cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



 

 for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we repurchased 43 million  shares for a total cost of 1389 million  and 48 million shares for a total cost of 1646 million respectively during 2014  and 2013  we also paid dividends of 333 million   008  per share and 252 million   006  per share on our common stock respectively a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



we plan to drill approximately 125  gross wells or 1150  net in 2015  compared to 200  gross wells  1765  net drilled in 2014  in 2015  we plan to spend approximately 9000 million  in total capital and exploration expenditures compared to 16 billion  excluding property acquisitions of 2147 million  as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in 2014  due to the weak commodity price environment our overall capital and exploration spending in 2015 is expected to be lower than our expenditures in 2014 we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  are set forth in the following table 



 

 amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2014  was 1267 million  see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as crude oil and natural gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 007 per mcfe respectively on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 218 million or decrease by approximately 148 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligations 

the majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket 

through march 31 2014 we elected to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives on a prospective basis accordingly the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were effective was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheet the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

employee benefit plans 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plans 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity the guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers as a new topic accounting standards codification topic 606 the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu is effective beginning in fiscal year 2017 and can be adopted either retrospectively or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201415 presentation of financial statements  going concern as a new subtopic accounting standards codification subtopic 20540 the new going concern standard codifies in generally accepted accounting principles gaap management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2016 and early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2014  and 2013  compared 

we reported net income for 2014  of 1045 million  or 025  per share compared to net income for 2013  of 2798 million  or 067  per share the decrease  in net income was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase  in operating revenues and an increase in income tax benefit 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





 

 natural gas revenues 

the increase  in natural gas revenues of 1854 million  is due to higher  production partially offset by lower  natural gas prices the increase  in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain noncore asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 225 million  is due to higher  production partially offset by lower  crude oil prices the increase  in production was a result of our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas partially offset by lower production associated with certain noncore asset dispositions in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013 

gain loss on derivative instruments 

effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations gain loss on derivative instruments includes an 817 million   gain  related to the change in fair value of realized cash settlements of derivative instruments previously frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and a 1376 million  unrealized marktomarket gain  on our commodity derivative instruments 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized and unrealized gain loss of our derivative instruments 



brokered natural gas 

the 21 million   decrease  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of lower  brokered volumes and an increase  in purchase price that outpaced the increase  in sales price 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 8699 million  from 2013  to 2014  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 46 

2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment there was no impairment in 2013 

 earnings loss on equity method investments  the increase in equity method investments is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013 

gain loss on sale of assets during 2014  we recognized an aggregate gain  of 171 million  primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2013  we recognized an aggregate net gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a net gain of 195 million 

interest expense interest expense increase d 77 million  as a result of an increase in interest expense of 97 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 higher commitment fees of 23 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of 11 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 31 million due to the repayment of 750 million of our 733 weightedaverage fixed rate notes in july 2013 and 11 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 4100 million compared to approximately 4544 million during 2014  and 2013  respectively 

income tax expense income tax expense decrease d 2778 million  due to a decrease  in pretax income and a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were 2224  and 424  respectively the effective tax rate was lower as a result of a change in estimated net deferred state tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet which were based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate 

2013  and 2012  compared 

we reported net income for 2013  of 2798 million  or 067  per share compared to net income for 2012  of 1317 million  or 031  per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset higher operating expenses 

revenue price and volume variances 

our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices and production volumes below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 





 

 natural gas revenues 

the increase  in natural gas revenues of 4711 million  is due to higher production partially offset by lower natural gas prices the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program in pennsylvania and expanded infrastructure in the area partially offset by lower production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling in these areas and normal production declines 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase  in crude oil and condensate revenues of 635 million  is due to higher production associated with our oil‑focused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and to a lesser extent oklahoma partially offset by lower crude oil prices 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized and unrealized gain loss of our derivative instruments 



brokered natural gas 

the 10 million   increase  in brokered natural gas margin is a result of an increase  in sales price that outpaced the increase  in purchase price partially offset by a decrease  in brokered volumes 

operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increase d by 2681 million  from 2012  to 2013  the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 49 

 gain loss on sale of assets during 2013  we recognized an aggregate net gain of 214 million  which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties for a net gain of 195 million during 2012  we recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million  which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas 

interest expense interest expense decrease d 23 million  as a result lower debt extinguishment costs of 13 million associated with our revolving credit facility amendment in may 2012 and lower interest expense as a result of the repayment of 750 million of our 733 weighted‑average fixed rate notes in july 2013 these decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our revolving credit facility due to an increase in weighted‑average borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 4544 million during 2013  compared to approximately 2838 million 2012 partially offset by a lower weighted‑average effective interest rate of approximately 23 during 2013  compared to approximately 30 during 2012  

income tax expense income tax expense increase d 997 million  due to an increase in pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2013  and 2012  were 424  and 446  respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used to determine our deferred state tax liabilities and assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and risk management activities 

our risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and only provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price 

declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activities 

periodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar and swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2014  we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 



in the above table natural gas prices are stated per mcf 

the amounts set forth in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2014  and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

during 2014  natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 360  to 437  per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 422  to 480  per mcf covered 3368  bcf or 66  of natural gas production at an average price of 437  per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1022  bcf or 20  of natural gas production at an average price of 406  per mcf crude oil swaps covered 612  mbbl or 17  of crude oil production at an average price of 9700  per bbl 

we are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair market value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment 

risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixed rate notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair values of debt are as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves we believe this is attainable through a combination of disciplined management and our core asset base that offers a strategic advantage for continued growth key components of our business strategy include 

disciplined capital spending focused on highreturn organic projects we allocate our capital program based on projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth at attractive returns our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost highreturn repeatable drilling opportunities 

low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in these core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multiwell pad drilling in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure 

conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with select asset sales joint ventures and borrowings under our credit facility 

continued portfolio management we will continue to evaluate and manage our properties that no longer fit in our current portfolio through the execution of strategic asset sales or other similar arrangements we expect to utilize the proceeds generated from these activities for reinvestment into higherreturn projects in our core operating areas potential share repurchases or new growth initiatives 

expand our unconventional resource initiatives we will continue to evaluate opportunities that generate value and contribute to our growth initiatives including new exploration concepts and ideas that if successful can match the size scope and rate of returns of our existing core assets we will also consider the use of joint venture arrangements to achieve these objectives 

2014 outlook 

in 2014 we plan to spend between approximately 13 billion and 14 billion on capital and exploration activities we plan to drill approximately 155 to 175 gross wells or 150 to 170 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we expect to allocate approximately 73 of our 2014 capital program to the marcellus shale approximately 25 to our oilfocused play in the eagle ford shale and the remaining 2 to other emerging plays and nondrilling expenditures incremental to our capital and exploration expenditures program we also expect to contribute approximately 364 million to constitution pipeline company llc constitution to fund costs associated with the development and construction of a natural gas pipeline in northeast pennsylvania see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our investment in constitution 

description of properties 

our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional plays—the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental united states 

marcellus shale 

our marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county and to a lesser extent bradford and wyoming counties pennsylvania we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2013 net production in the marcellus shale was 3565 bcfe representing approximately 86 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 3546 net wells in the marcellus shale the majority of which are operated by us 

during 2013 we invested 8158 million in the marcellus shale and drilled 945 net horizontal wells and completed and turned in line 960 net wells as of december 31 2013 we had 300 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2013 with six drilling rigs operating in the play 

eagle ford shale 

our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio la salle and zavala counties texas where we hold over 60000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2013 our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford was 2164 mbbl and 12 bcf respectively or 142 bcfe representing approximately 3 of our full year equivalent production as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 854 net wells in the eagle ford 

during 2013 we invested 2615 million in the eagle ford and drilled or participated in drilling 332 net wells we exited 2013 with two drilling rigs operating in the play 

other oil and gas properties 

in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the utica shale in pennsylvania the pearsall shale in south texas the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas the devonian shale big lime weir and berea in west virginia and the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas 

in 2013 we invested 190 million in the pearsall shale and drilled a total of 111 net wells under a joint development agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of osaka gas co ltd osaka that was entered into in june 2012 under the joint development agreement osaka agreed to fund 85 of our share of drilling and completion costs associated with these leaseholds the drilling and completion carry of 1250 million was fully satisfied in fourth quarter 2013 

other properties 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and five local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2013 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia 

divestitures 

in december 2013 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles to chaparral energy llc for approximately 1600 million subject to post closing adjustments and recognized a 194 million gain on sale of assets we also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas to a third party for approximately 1234 million subject to post closing adjustments and recognized a 175 million loss on sale of assets 

in 2013 we sold various other proved and unproved properties for approximately 443 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million 

in december 2012 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas to a private company for 299 million and recognized an 182 million loss on sale of assets 

in june 2012 we sold a 35 nonoperated working interest associated with certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas to a whollyowned subsidiary of osaka for 1250 million and recognized a 670 million gain on sale of assets 

in 2012 we sold various other unproved properties and other assets for approximately 144 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 18 million 

in october 2011 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in colorado utah and wyoming to breitburn energy partners lp for 2850 million and recognized a 42 million gain on sale of assets 

in may 2011 we sold certain of our unproved haynesville and bossier shale oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 470 million and recognized a 342 million gain on sale of assets 

in 2011 we sold various other unproved properties and other assets for approximately 735 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 250 million 

in december 2010 we sold our existing pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to williams field services williams a subsidiary of williams partners lp for 150 million and recognized a 493 million gain on sale of assets 

in 2010 we sold various other proved and unproved properties and other assets for approximately 322 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 163 million 

marketing 

substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system in the gulf coast area we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or through the use of purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts 

to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production or obtain favorable prices 

in february 2014 we entered into a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for the construction of a new pipeline with committed takeaway capacity from our acreage position in susquehanna country pennsylvania under the terms of the precedent agreement transco will construct and operate approximately 177 miles of new pipeline from the zick area of susquehanna county to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania we will own 850000 mmbtu per day of firm capacity on the newly constructed pipeline and acquire a 20 equity interest in the project subject to certain terms and conditions yet to be determined and regulatory approval the expected inservice date for the new pipeline is scheduled for the second half of 2017 in february 2014 we also entered into a definitive gas sale and purchase agreement with wgl midstream inc wgl to sell 500000 mmbtu per day of natural gas to wgl for a primary term of 15 years commencing upon the inservice date of the newly constructed pipeline 

risk management 

from time to time we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas and crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments 

from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement 

during 2013 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 309 to 515 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 398 to 623 per mcf covered 2417 bcf or 61 of our natural gas production at an average price of 396 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 1095 mbbl or 38 of our crude oil production at an average price 10190 per bbl 

as of december 31 2013 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 



we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion related to our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



1 proved undeveloped reserves for 2013 2012 and 2011 include reserves drilled but awaiting completion of 2391 bcfe 1533 bcfe and 1324 bcfe respectively 2 natural gas equivalents are determined using a ratio of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or ngls 3 reserve life index is equal to yearend proved reserves divided by annual production for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 5454 bcfe at december 31 2013 of which 97 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 42 from 3842 bcfe at december 31 2012 in 2013 we added 17247 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions discoveries and other additions primarily due to the positive results from our drilling program in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania we 

also had a net upward revision of 4328 bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 3726 bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania and an upward revision of 602 bcfe associated with commodity pricing in 2013 we produced 4136 bcfe and sold 1323 bcfe associated with the divestiture of oil and gas properties in oklahoma and west texas 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and risk factors—our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated in item 1a 

technologies used in reserves estimates 

we utilize several different traditional methods to estimate our crude oil and natural gas reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however the seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation 

internal control 

our vice president engineering and technology is the technical person primarily responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of four professional engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by our independent third party engineers he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 31 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 22 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers 

our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management including the chairman president and chief executive officer and vice president chief financial officer and treasurer for approval 

miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our 

reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 23 2014 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2013 we had 22258 bcfe of proved undeveloped pud reserves with future development costs of 16 billion which represents an increase of 6766 bcfe compared with december 31 2012 as of december 31 2013 all proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years of initial disclosure of these reserves 

the following table is a reconciliation of the change in our pud reserves bcfe 



changes in pud reserves that occurred during the year were due to 

• transfer of 5612 bcfe from pud to proved developed reserves based on total capital expenditures of 4495 million during 2013 • new pud reserve additions of 9506 bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania • positive pud reserve revisions of 2912 bcfe resulting from positive performance revisions of 2955 bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania offset by negative price revisions of 43 bcfe and • sales of reserves in place of 40 bcfe primarily in oklahoma 13 

production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and crude oil including condensate and ngls average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which contains more than 15 of our total proved reserves 



1 includes ngls which represent less than 1 of our equivalent production for all years presented and 105 69 and 36 of our crude oil production for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2013 acreage in which our interest is limited to royalty and overriding royalty interests is excluded 



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

in the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of december 31 2013 is 67234 109948 and 34894 for the years ending december 31 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively 

we expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options as of december 31 2013 approximately 38 of our expiring acreage disclosed above is located in our core areas of operation where we currently expect to continue development activities andor extend the lease terms 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2013 this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



1 total percentage of gross operated wells is 915 

drilling activity 

we drilled wells or participated in the drilling of wells as indicated in the table below 



at december 31 2013 9 gross 90 net wells were in the process of being drilled 

other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens 

such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties often little investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources 

major customers 

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 and three customers accounted for approximately 18 12 and 10 respectively of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2011 we did not have any one customer account for greater than 10 of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our whollyowned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 26 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petition 

additionally in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution pipeline company llc at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for transportation capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 120mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity ferc has scheduled issuance of the projects final environmental impact statement for june 13 2014 there is no guarantee that ferc will certify the project or if they do that the project scope or timeline for construction will remain unchanged by the regulatory permitting process if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate 

pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

we use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an enduser exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless the changes to the swap market as a result of doddfrank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates 

by which annual adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 the result of indexing is a ceiling rate for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file costofservice based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipelines rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index 

pipeline safety regulation 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new sevenyear reassessment cycle began during 2013 

in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulations 

in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remotecontrolled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible 

regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 aside from rules contained in the act which include revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure the dot has not yet promulgated any new regulations required by the act 

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot 

the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations 

environmental and safety regulations 

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

endangered species act the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

safe drinking water act the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the states environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read risk factors—federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays in item 1a 

greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act please read risk factors—climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results and could result in an impairment charge see future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

• the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties on the global natural gas supply • the level of consumer product demand 23 

• weather conditions • political conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions including the middle east africa and south america • the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls • the price level of foreign imports • actions of governmental authorities • the availability proximity and capacity of gathering transportation processing andor refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil • inventory storage levels • the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation including environmental and climate change regulation • the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels • technological advances affecting energy consumption • speculation by investors in oil and natural gas • variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices and • overall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and crude oil if natural gas and crude oil prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

• unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations • equipment failures or accidents • adverse weather conditions • decreases in natural gas and oil prices • surface access restrictions • loss of title or other title related issues • compliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation and • costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials 24 

our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

• the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic data • the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects • the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled • economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews • our financial resources and results and • the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most 

appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and crude oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the future 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2013 will increase at an estimated rate of 05 during 2014 and then decline at estimated rates of 36 24 and 18 during 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to 

changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2014 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2014 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result 

in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20112016 national enforcement initiative assuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

• the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business • the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business • potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties and • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

• well site blowouts cratering and explosions • equipment failures • pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids • uncontrolled flows of natural gas oil or well fluids • pipeline ruptures • fires • formations with abnormal pressures • handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids • release of toxic gas • buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials • pollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties and • natural disasters any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2013 we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program 

we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 85 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 25 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2013 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

• a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations • production is less than expected or • there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually 

consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover on november 23 2011 the epa announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production the epa expects to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in august 2014 further on may 24 2013 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the railroad commission of texas adopted rules in december 2011 requiring disclosure of 

certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids on december 19 2013 the pennsylvania supreme court struck down as unconstitutional portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could result in additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2014 the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in 2014 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms president obama created the interagency working group on unconventional natural gas and oil by executive order on april 13 2012 which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases in the united states climate change action is evolving at the state regional and federal levels on december 17 2010 the epa amended the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule reporting rule originally issued in september 2009 the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected 

concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epas endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however following issuance of the endangerment finding epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil on june 3 2010 epa issued a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process with the largest sources first subject to permitting in addition on november 8 2010 epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epas ghg reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year were required to report annual ghg emissions to epa for the first time by september 28 2012 we submitted our report in compliance with the deadline 

in addition congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation or legislation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas 

moreover in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it ongoing international discussions following the united nations climate change conference in warsaw poland in november 2013 are exploring options to reduce global emissions by the first quarter of 2015 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable 

certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative 

impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

• for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders • for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law • under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and • for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

on an equivalent basis our production in 2013 increased by 55 from 2012 we produced 4136 bcfe or 11 bcfe per day in 2013 compared to 2677 bcfe or 7314 mmcfe per day in 2012 natural gas production increased by 1410 bcf or 56 to 3942 bcf in 2013 compared to 2532 bcf in 2012 this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale were decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling and normal production declines crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 814 mbbls or 34 from 2407 mbbls in 2012 to 3221 mbbls in 2013 this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oilfocused drilling program in south texas and to a lesser extent oklahoma 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2013 was 356 per mcf 3 lower than the 367 per mcf price realized in 2012 our average realized crude oil price for 2013 was 10113 per bbl less than 1 lower than the 10165 per bbl price realized in 2012 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

we drilled 181 gross wells 1535 net with a success rate of 98 in 2013 compared to 170 gross wells 1178 net with a success rate of 98 in 2012 our 2013 total capital and exploration spending was 12 billion compared to 9785 million in 2012 the increase in capital spending was the result of our marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania and our drilling program in the eagle ford shale and pearsall shale in south texas in both 2013 and 2012 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2014 our 2014 drilling program includes between 13 billion and 14 billion in capital and exploration expenditures funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2013 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations from our commodity derivatives proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties during the year and net borrowings under our credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures repayments of debt and related interest payments share repurchases and the payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 



operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by 3724 million over 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 55 for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 3 and less than 1 respectively for 2013 compared to 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased by 1503 million over 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices equivalent production volumes increased by 43 for 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 18 for 2012 compared to 2011 while average realized crude oil prices increased by 12 compared to the same period 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods 

investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased by 1527 million from 2012 to 2013 due to a 2668 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures and a 120 million 

increase associated with our equity investment in constitution these increases were partially offset by a net 1261 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets a portion of which was retained in a qualified intermediary and recognized as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet the 2779 million increase from 2011 to 2012 was due to a decrease of 2343 million of proceeds from the sale of assets an increase of 367 million in capital and exploration expenditures and an increase of 69 million associated with our equity investment in constitution 

financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased by 2279 million from 2012 to 2013 due to 1646 million of stock repurchases 770 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in dividends paid of 85 million partially offset by an 189 increase in the tax benefit associated with our stockbased compensation and a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 23 million cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 1545 million from 2011 to 2012 due to 1620 million of higher net borrowings partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of 42 million and cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 40 million 

in december 2013 we exercised the 500 million accordion feature of our amended credit facility thereby increasing the available credit line to 14 billion as of december 31 2013 the borrowing base under our amended credit facility was 23 billion see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

at december 31 2013 we had 4600 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 20 compared to 3250 million of borrowings outstanding at a weightedaverage interest rate of 22 at december 31 2012 as of december 31 2013 we had 9390 million available for future borrowings under our credit facility 

we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit facility and fixed rate notes as of december 31 2013 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



1 includes 4600 million and 3250 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and 750 million of current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2013 we paid dividends of 252 million 006 per share on our common stock in july 2013 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from 001 per share to 002 per share a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



we plan to drill approximately 155 to 175 gross wells or 150 to 170 net in 2014 compared to 181 gross wells 1535 net drilled in 2013 in 2014 we plan to spend between approximately 13 billion and 14 billion in total capital and exploration expenditures excluding expected contributions of approximately 364 million to constitution compared to 12 billion in 2013 we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 are set forth in the following table 



1 interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at december 31 2013 interest payments on our credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2013 outstanding balance of 4600 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date a constant interest rate of 20 was assumed which was the december 31 2013 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 2 for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2013 was 759 million see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 006 per mcfe and an increase of 007 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 007 per mcfe and an increase of 008 per mcfe respectively on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 73 million or decrease by approximately 49 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligation 

the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is 

designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

employee benefit plans 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plans 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2013 we adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities and asu no 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities this guidance impacted the disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives and did not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

effective january 1 2013 we adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this guidance impacted our disclosures associated with items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income  loss and did not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2013 and 2012 compared 

we reported net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share compared to net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per share the increase in net income was due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset by higher operating costs 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



1 natural gas revenues exclude the unrealized loss of 05 million from the change in fair value of our derivatives not designated as hedges in 2012 there were no unrealized gains or losses in 2013 



1 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 013 per mcf in 2013 and 089 per mcf in 2012 2 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 148 per bbl in 2013 and 500 per bbl in 2012 

natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 4711 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is due to higher production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increase in our production was the result of our marcellus shale drilling program and expanded infrastructure in the area partially offset by lower production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling in these areas and normal production declines 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 635 million is due to higher production associated with our oilfocused drilling program in south texas and to a lesser extent oklahoma partially offset by lower realized crude oil prices 

brokered natural gas 



the 10 million increase in brokered natural gas margin is a result of an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price partially offset by a decrease in brokered volumes 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the increase  decrease to operating revenues from the realized impact of cash settlements for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the net unrealized change in fair value of other financial derivative instruments 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increased by 2681 million from 2012 to 2013 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• direct operations increased 226 million largely due to higher operating costs primarily driven by higher production in addition we experienced higher costs associated with oil separation and processing and related fuel charges as a result of more stringent oil pipeline quality requirements in south texas higher plugging and abandonment costs primarily in east texas and higher environmental and regulatory costs partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in workover activity and lower lease maintenance costs • transportation and gathering increased 862 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas throughout the second half of 2012 • brokered natural gas increased by 14 million from 2012 to 2013 see the preceding table titled  brokered natural gas revenue and cost  for further analysis • taxes other than income decreased 58 million due to lower drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities full year 2012 included 83 million related to the initial assessment of drilling impact fees associated with 2011 and prior period wells in addition franchise sales and use and ad valorem taxes decreased year over year these decreases were partially offset by higher production taxes as a result of an increase in oil production in south texas • exploration decreased 193 million due to lower exploratory dry hole costs of 136 million primarily due to our brown densesmackover exploratory well in union county arkansas that was recorded in 2012 there were no significant exploratory dry hole costs recorded in 2013 in addition geophysical and geological expenses decreased by 70 million due to fewer requirements for the acquisition and processing of seismic data • depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1996 million of which 2344 million was due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a decrease of 708 million due to a lower dda rate of 144 per mcfe for 2013 compared to 161 per mcfe for 2012 the lower dda rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our 2013 and 2012 drilling programs in addition amortization of unproved properties increased 355 million primarily due to an increase in amortization rates as 52 

a result of our ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during the year 

• general and administrative decreased 166 million due to lower pension expense of 195 million associated with the liquidation of our pension plan that occurred in the second quarter of 2012 a decrease in legal expenses of 90 million and 22 million of lower charitable contribution costs associated with the funding of the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania in 2012 these decreases are partially offset by 183 million of higher stockbased compensation expense associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price during 2013 compared to 2012 and the achievement of the interim and final triggers of our supplemental incentive compensation plan during 2013 gain  loss on sale of assets during 2013 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties for a net gain of 195 million during 2012 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas 

interest expense and other net interest expense and other decreased by 34 million as a result lower debt extinguishment costs of 13 million associated with our credit facility amendment in may 2012 and lower interest expense as a result of the repayment of 75 million of our 733 weightedaverage fixed rate notes in july 2013 these decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our credit facility due to an increase in weightedaverage borrowings under our revolving credit facility based on daily balances of approximately 4544 million during 2013 compared to approximately 2838 million 2012 partially offset by a lower weightedaverage effective interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings of approximately 23 during 2013 compared to approximately 30 during 2012 

income tax expense income tax expense increased by 997 million due to an increase in pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate  the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were 424 and 446 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes 

2012 and 2011 compared 

we reported net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per share compared to net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 029 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset higher operating costs 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



1 natural gas revenues exclude the unrealized loss of 05 million and 10 million from the change in fair value of our derivatives not designated as hedges in 2012 and 2011 respectively 



1 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 089 per mcf in 2012 and 047 per mcf in 2011 2 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 500 per bbl in 2012 and 101 per bbl in 2011 

natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 1367 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is due to higher production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increase in our production was the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and expanded infrastructure partially offset by the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 and lower production in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to oilfocused drilling and normal production declines 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 1020 million is primarily due to higher production associated with our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma and higher realized oil prices 

brokered natural gas 



the 19 million decrease in brokered natural gas margin is a result of a decrease in brokered volumes and a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase price 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the increase  decrease to operating revenues from the realized impact of cash settlements for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the net unrealized change in fair value of other financial derivative instruments 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increased by 2127 million from 2011 to 2012 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• direct operations increased 108 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase were higher employee related expenses and lease maintenance costs partially offset by lower workover costs • transportation and gathering increased 700 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production and transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late 2011 and throughout 2012 primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas • brokered natural gas decreased 153 million from 2011 to 2012 see the preceding table titled  brokered natural gas revenue and cost  for further analysis • taxes other than income increased 213 million due to additional costs associated with the passage of an impact fee in pennsylvania on marcellus shale production that was imposed by state legislature in february 2012 and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in 2012 compared to 2011 • exploration increased 10 million as the result of increased exploration activity partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data • depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1083 million which includes a 1314 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an 85 million decrease due to a lower dda rate of 161 per mcfe for 2012 compared to 164 mcfe for 2011 the increase in dda was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 144 million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in pennsylvania and south texas and the sale of certain pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in the second quarter of 2012 • general and administrative increased by 166 million due to higher pension expense of 140 million associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter 2012 and higher legal costs and professional fees of 60 million also contributing to the increase was the accrual of 19 million associated with 56 

fines and penalties assessed by the office of natural resources revenue for certain alleged volume reporting matters which we are currently disputing related to properties we no longer own and a 22 million charitable contribution to fund the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by 63 million of lower stockbased compensation expense primarily associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price in 2012 compared to 2011 

gain  loss on sale of assets during 2012 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas during the 2011 an aggregate net gain of 634 million was recognized primarily due to the sale of certain undeveloped leaseholds in east texas and the sale of other noncore assets 

interest expense net interest expense and other decreased by 34 million due to a decrease in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which decreased to approximately 30 during 2012 compared to approximately 41 during 2011 partially offset by a decrease in weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on weightedaverage debt of 2838 million in 2012 compared to weightedaverage debt of 3177 million in 2011 

income tax expense income tax expense decreased by 67 million due a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased pretax income the effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were 446 and 480 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into commodity derivative instruments including collar and swap agreements to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2013 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 



in the above table natural gas prices are stated per mcf the amounts set forth under the estimated fair value asset liability column in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2013 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

during 2013 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 309 to 515 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 398 to 623 per mcf covered 2417 bcf or 61 of our natural gas production at an average price of 396 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 1095 mbbl or 38 of our crude oil production at an average price 10190 per bbl 

we are exposed to market risk on our commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america bank of montreal goldman sachs ing capital markets jpmorgan and morgan stanley 

fair market value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair values of longterm debt are as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

strategy 

our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves we believe this is attainable through a combination of disciplined management and our core asset base that offers a strategic advantage for continued growth key components of our business strategy include 

disciplined capital spending focused on highreturn organic projects we allocate our capital program based on projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth at attractive returns our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost highreturn repeatable drilling opportunities 

low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in these core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure 

conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with asset sales joint ventures and borrowings under our credit facility 

expand our unconventional resource initiatives through value generating opportunities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that generate value and contribute to our growth initiatives including potential strategic sales of assets that no longer fit in our current portfolio and the use of various joint venture arrangements to achieve our objectives we intend to reinvest the proceeds from these activities in our core unconventional assets 

2013 outlook 

in 2013 we plan to spend between approximately 9500 million and 10 billion on capital and exploration activities we plan to drill approximately 170 to 180 gross wells or 130 to 145 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford and pearsall shale in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma we expect to allocate approximately 65 of our 2013 capital program to the marcellus shale approximately 30 to our 

liquidsfocused plays in south texas and oklahoma and the remaining 5 to other emerging plays and nondrilling expenditures in 2013 we also expect to contribute approximately 120 million to constitution pipeline company llc constitution to fund costs associated with the development and construction of a pipeline in northeast pennsylvania which is incremental to our capital and exploration expenditures see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our investment in constitution 

description of properties 

our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in three unconventional plays—the marcellus shale in pennsylvania the eagle ford in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma we also have significant noncore operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental united states 

marcellus shale 

the marcellus shale is one of our major operating areas and represents our largest growth and capital investment area over the last four years our properties are principally located in susquehanna county and to a lesser extent bradford and wyoming counties pennsylvania we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2012 net production in the marcellus shale was 2093 bcfe representing approximately 78 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 2242 net wells producing in the marcellus shale 

during 2012 we invested 6166 million in the marcellus shale and drilled 697 net horizontal wells and completed and turned in line 802 net wells as of december 31 2012 we had 320 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2012 with five drilling rigs operating in the play 

eagle ford shale 

our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio la salle and zavala counties texas where we hold over 60000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2012 our net liquids and natural gas production from the eagle ford was 1581 mbbl and 16 bcf respectively or 111 bcfe representing approximately 4 of our full year equivalent production as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 477 net wells producing in the eagle ford 

during 2012 we invested 1710 million in the eagle ford and drilled or participated in drilling 232 net wells we exited 2012 with one drilling rig operating in the play 

marmaton 

our properties in the marmaton oil play are principally located in beaver county oklahoma and ochiltree county texas as of december 31 2012 we had over 70000 net acres in the play in 2012 our net liquids and natural gas production from the marmaton was 364 mbbl and 06 bcf respectively or 28 bcfe representing approximately 1 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 211 net wells producing in the marmaton and 33 net wells completing or waiting on completion 

during 2012 we invested 803 million in the marmaton and drilled or participated in drilling 179 net wells we exited 2012 with two drilling rigs operating in the play 

other oil and gas properties 

in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the pearsall 

shale in south texas the utica shale in pennsylvania the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas the devonian shale big lime weir and berea shale in west virginia the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas and the chase morrow and chester formations in oklahoma 

in 2013 we plan to drill a total of 98 net wells in the pearsall shale all of which are subject to a joint development agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of osaka gas co ltd osaka that was entered into contemporaneously with the sale of a 35 nonoperated working interest associated with certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in june 2012 under the joint development agreement osaka agreed to fund 85 of our share of future drilling and completion costs associated with these leaseholds until it has paid approximately 1260 million the drilling and completion carry will terminate in june 2014 

other properties 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3134 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and five local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2012 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia 

divestitures 

in december 2012 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas to a private company for 299 million subject to post closing adjustments and recognized an 182 million loss on sale of assets

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas and crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap was put in place 

during 2012 natural gas and crude oil swaps covered 960 bcf or 38 and 1709 mbbl or 76 of natural gas and crude oil production at an average price of 522 per mcf and 10012 per bbl respectively natural gas basis swaps covered 17 bcf or 7 of our natural gas production at an average price of 025 per mcf natural gas collars with a floor price of 360 per mcf and a ceiling price of 417 per mcf covered 30 bcf or 1 of our natural gas production at an average price of 370 per mcf 

as of december 31 2012 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 



we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



1 proved undeveloped reserves for 2012 and 2011 include reserves drilled but awaiting completion of 1533 bcfe and 1324 bcfe respectively there were no reserves drilled awaiting completion included in proved undeveloped reserves in 2010 2 natural gas equivalents are determined using a ratio of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids 3 reserve life index is equal to yearend reserves divided by annual production for the year ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 3842 bcfe at december 31 2012 of which 96 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 27 from 3033 bcfe at december 31 2011 due to the positive results from our drilling program in 2012 we had a net upward revision of 1886 bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 3696 bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by a downward revision of 1145 bcfe associated with decreased reserve commodity pricing and a downward revision of 665 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves that are no longer in our fiveyear development plan 

our reserve estimates were based on decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations analogies or combinations of these methods for each well reservoir or field the proved reserve estimates presented herein were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents ltd miller and lents independent petroleum engineers miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of the proved reserves estimated by us and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents dated january 31 2013 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents and other information about our reserves including the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and risk factors—our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated in item 1a 

internal control 

our corporate reservoir engineers report to the vice president of engineering and technology who maintains oversight and compliance responsibility for the internal reserve estimation process and provides oversight for the annual audit of our yearend reserves by our independent third party engineers miller and lents our corporate reservoir engineering group consists of four petroleumchemical engineers with petroleumchemical engineering degrees and between two and 30 years of industry experience between two and 30 years of reservoir engineeringmanagement experience and between two and 14 years managing our reserves all four engineers are members of the society of petroleum engineers 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserve estimates at miller and lents meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2012 we had 1549 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves with future development costs of 13 billion which represents an increase of 3161 bcfe compared with december 31 2011 for 

2012 total capital related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves was 3707 million resulting in the conversion of 4109 bcfe of reserves to proved developed during 2012 we had 5014 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions and 2335 bcfe of positive proved undeveloped reserve performance revisions primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by the removal of 665 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves associated with drilling locations in east texas no longer anticipated to be developed within the next five years due to a continued shift in our drilling program 

production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and crude oil including condensate and natural gas liquids average natural gas and crude oil sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which contains more than 15 of our total proved reserves 



acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2012 acreage in which our interest is limited to royalty and overriding royalty interests is excluded 



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

our net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years as of december 31 2012 is 202375 95310 and 82660 for the years ending december 31 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively these amounts assume no future successful development extension or renewal of undeveloped acreage 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and crude oil wells at december 31 2012 this summary includes natural gas and crude oil wells in which we have a working interest 



1 total percentage of gross operated wells is 883 

drilling activity 

we drilled wells or participated in the drilling of wells as indicated in the table below 



at december 31 2012 18 wells 131 net were being drilled or awaiting completion 

other business matters 

title to properties 

we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties often little investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 

competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources 

major customers 

in 2012 three customers accounted for approximately 18 12 and 10 respectively of our total sales in 2011 we did not have any one customer account for greater than 10 of our total sales in 2010 one customer accounted for approximately 11 of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil 

and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program 

some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we indirectly own an intrastate natural gas pipeline that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 26 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates in addition we have executed a precedent agreement with constitution pipeline company llc a subsidiary of williams partners lp for transportation capacity and a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania in april 2012 the project sponsors requested to participate in fercs prefiling procedures and once complete will need to request and receive a certificate of public convenience and necessity from ferc prior to commencing construction there is no guarantee that ferc will certify the project or if they do that the project scope or timeline for construction will remain unchanged by the regulatory permitting process if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga 

our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate 

pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential 

effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which annual adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 the result of indexing is a ceiling rate for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file costofservice based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for 

the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipelines rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential 

another ferc matter that may impact our transportation costs relates to a policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an actual or potential income tax liability to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income we currently do not transport any of our crude oil or natural gas liquids on a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership 

we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the fercs policy on income tax allowances 

pipeline safety regulation 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new sevenyear reassessment cycle will begin in 2013 

in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulations 

in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remotecontrolled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 aside from rules contained in the act which include revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure the dot has not yet promulgated any new regulations required by the act 

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot 

the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations 

environmental and safety regulations 

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read risk factors—federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays in item 1a 

greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the us congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act please read risk factors—climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce in item 1a 

osha and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results and could result in an impairment charge see future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following 

• the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus properties on the global natural gas supply • the level of consumer product demand • weather conditions • political conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions including the middle east africa and south america • the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls • the price level of foreign imports • actions of governmental authorities • the availability proximity and capacity of gathering transportation processing andor refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil • inventory storage levels • the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation including environmental and climate change regulation • the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 21 

• technological advances affecting energy consumption • speculation by investors in oil and gas • variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices and • overall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

• unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations • equipment failures or accidents • adverse weather conditions • decreases in natural gas and oil prices • surface access restrictions • loss of title or other title related issues • compliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation and • costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

• the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic data • the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects • the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled • economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews • our financial resources and results and 22 

• the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 

future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and crude oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties 

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including riskadjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices 

adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the future 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2012 will increase at an estimated rate of 9 during 2013 and then decline at estimated rates of 36 22 and 17 during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all 

we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues 

strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate 

our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2013 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of 

our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2013 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations 

negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing the oil spill in the gulf of mexico and the explosion of natural gas transmission lines in california and elsewhere may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these action may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business 

increased drilling in the shale formations may cause pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints that may limit our ability to sell natural gas andor receive market prices for our natural gas 

the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates if drilling in the marcellus shale continues to be successful the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20112013 national enforcement initiative assuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to 

administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise 

there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

• the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business • the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business • potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties and • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

• well site blowouts cratering and explosions • equipment failures 26 

• pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids • uncontrolled flows of natural gas oil or well fluids • pipeline ruptures • fires • formations with abnormal pressures • handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids • release of toxic gas • buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials • pollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties and • natural disasters any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2012 we owned or operated approximately 3134 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 117 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 37 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2012 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available of capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below 

the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

• a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations • production is less than expected or • there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids moreover on november 23 2011 the epa announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production further on may 4 2012 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been 

completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring by october 15 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves we are currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business 

in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia texas kansas louisiana and montana and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the railroad commission of texas adopted rules in december 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids 

we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our ep operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2014 the regulations will be developed 

under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal 

a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released of a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in 2014 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms president obama created the interagency working group on unconventional natural gas and oil by executive order on april 13 2012 which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 

there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases in the united states climate change action is evolving at the state regional and federal levels on december 17 2010 the epa amended the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule reporting rule originally issued in september 2009 the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epas endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however following issuance of the endangerment finding epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil also according to the epa the final motor vehicle ghg standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources thus on june 3 2010 epa issued a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process with the largest sources first subject to permitting in addition on november 8 2010 epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epas ghg reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year were required to report annual ghg emissions to epa for the first time by september 28 2012 we submitted our report in compliance with the deadline 

in addition congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation or legislation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new 

regulatory or reporting requirements in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas 

moreover in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it ongoing international discussions following the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in december 2012 are exploring options to replace the kyoto protocol 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make estimating any future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change extremely challenging 

certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will 

not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

• for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders • for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law • under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and • for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

overview 

on an equivalent basis our production in 2012 increased by 43 from 2011 we produced 2677 bcfe or 7314 mmcfe per day in 2012 compared to 1875 bcfe or 5137 mmcfe per day in 2011 natural gas production increased by 744 bcf or 42 to 2532 bcf in 2012 compared to 1788 bcf in 2011 this increase was primarily the result of increased production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale was the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 along with decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 964 mbbls or 67 from 1443 mbbls in 2011 to 2407 mbbls in 2012 this increase was primarily the result of increased production resulting from our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma 

our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2012 was 367 per mcf 18 lower than the 446 per mcf price realized in 2011 our average realized crude oil price for 2012 was 10165 per bbl 12 higher than the 9049 per bbl price realized in 2011 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

we drilled 170 gross wells with a success rate of 98 in 2012 compared to 161 gross wells with a success rate of 99 in 2011 our 2012 total capital and exploration spending was 9785 million compared to 9055 million in 2011 this increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford shale in south texas including a portion towards the pearsall shale and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma in both 2012 and 2011 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2013 our 2013 drilling program includes between 9500 million and 10 billion in capital and exploration expenditures funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2012 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties and other assets during the year and borrowings under our credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures in addition to repayments of debt and related interest final contributions to fund the liquidation of our pension plan and dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased by 1503 million over 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding noncash expenses this increase was partially offset by changes in working capital and longterm assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices equivalent production volumes increased by 43 for 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 18 for 2012 compared to 2011 while average realized crude oil prices increased by 12 compared to the same period 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased by 169 million over 2010 this increase was primarily due to increased operating income in 2011 as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding noncash expenses this increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 44 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 8 over the same period 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods 

investing activities 

the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures we established our budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 

cash flows used in investing activities increased by 2779 million from 2011 to 2012 and decreased by 1261 million from 2010 to 2011 the increase from 2011 to 2012 was due to a decrease of 2343 million of proceeds from the sale of assets an increase of 367 million in capital and exploration expenditures and an increase of 69 million associated with our equity investment in constitution the decrease from 2010 to 2011 was due to an increase of 1601 million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of 340 million in capital and exploration expenditures 

financing activities 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 1545 million from 2011 to 2012 this was primarily due to 1620 million of higher net borrowings 700 million increase in borrowings and 920 million decrease in repayment of debt partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of 42 million and cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 40 million cash flows used in financing activities increased by 1849 million from 2010 to 2011 this was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of 1950 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 128 million 

at december 31 2012 we had 3250 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 22 compared to 1880 million of borrowings outstanding at a weightedaverage interest rate of 49 at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 we had 5740 million available for future borrowings under our credit facility 

in may 2012 we amended our credit facility to adjust the margins associated with borrowings under the facility and extended the maturity date from september 2015 to may 2017 the credit facility as amended provides for an available credit line of 900 million and contains a 500 million accordion feature whereby we may increase the available credit line to 14 billion if one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount as of december 31 2012 the borrowing base under our amended credit facility was 17 billion see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



1 includes 750 million of current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2012 and 3250 million and 1880 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we paid dividends of 168 million 008 per share on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



we plan to drill approximately 170 to 180 gross wells 130 to 145 net in 2013 compared to 170 gross wells 1178 net drilled in 2012 this 2013 drilling program includes between approximately 9500 million and 10 billion in total capital and exploration expenditures excluding expected contributions of approximately 120 million to constitution compared to 9785 million in 2012 we expect our capital spending in 2013 to be consistent with that of 2012 based on our estimate of natural gas and crude oil prices over the next year we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 are set forth in the following table 



1 interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our 11 billion longterm debt outstanding including current maturities at december 31 2012 interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2012 outstanding balance of 3250 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date a constant interest rate of 22 was assumed which was the december 31 2012 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 2 for further information on our obligations under transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2012 was 670 million see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller  lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our dda rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including riskadjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil 

unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property 

lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 23 million or decrease by approximately 18 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligation 

the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

employee benefit plans 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either 1 offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or 2 subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update clarify that the scope of asu 201111 applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging including bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

results of operations 

2012 and 2011 compared 

we reported net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 063 per share compared to net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an 

increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices and higher operating costs 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



1 natural gas revenues exclude the unrealized loss of 05 million and 10 million from the change in fair value of our derivatives not designated as hedges in 2012 and 2011 respectively 



1 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 089 per mcf in 2012 and by 047 per mcf in 2011 2 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 500 per bbl in 2012 and by 101 per bbl in 2011 

natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 1367 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is primarily due to increased production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increased production was primarily a result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and expanded infrastructure partially offset by the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 and decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 1020 million is primarily due to increased production associated with our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma coupled with higher realized oil prices 

brokered natural gas 



the decreased brokered natural gas margin of 19 million is primarily a result of a decrease in brokered volumes coupled with a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase price 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the increase  decrease to operating revenues from the realized impact of cash settlements for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the net unrealized change in fair value of other financial derivative instruments 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increased by 2127 million from 2011 to 2012 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• direct operations increased 108 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase are higher employee related and lease maintenance costs partially offset by lower workover costs • transportation and gathering increased by 700 million primarily due higher throughput due to an increase in production and higher transportation rates coupled with the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late 2011 and throughout 2012 primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas • brokered natural gas decreased by 153 million from 2011 to 2012 see the preceding table titled  brokered natural gas revenue and cost  for further analysis • taxes other than income increased 213 million primarily due to additional costs associated with the passage of an impact fee in pennsylvania on marcellus shale production that was imposed by state legislature in february 2012 and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in 2012 compared to 2011 • exploration increased 10 million primarily due to an increase in exploration expense as the result of increased activity partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data • depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1083 million with a 1314 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an 85 million decrease due to a lower dda rate this increase was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 144 million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in pennsylvania and south texas and the sale of certain pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in the second quarter of 2012 49 

• general and administrative increased by 166 million primarily due to 140 million higher pension expense associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter 2012 and higher legal costs and professional fees of 60 million also contributing to the increase was the accrual of 19 million associated with fines and penalties assessed by the office of natural resources revenue for certain alleged volume reporting matters which we are currently disputing related to properties we no longer own and a 22 million charitable contribution to fund the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by 63 million of lower stockbased compensation expense primarily associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price in 2012 compared to 2011 gain  loss on sale of assets 

during 2012 we recognized an aggregate gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas during the 2011 an aggregate gain of 634 million was recognized primarily due to the sale of certain undeveloped leaseholds in east texas and the sale of other noncore assets 

interest expense net 

interest expense and other decreased by 34 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which decreased to approximately 30 during 2012 compared to approximately 41 during 2011 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on weightedaverage debt of 2838 million in 2012 compared to weightedaverage debt of 3177 million in 2011 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased by 67 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased pretax income the effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were 446 and 480 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes 

2011 and 2010 compared 

we reported net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share compared to net income of 1034 million or 050 per share for 2010 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher operating costs 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



1 natural gas revenues exclude the unrealized loss of 10 million and 02 million from the change in fair value of our derivatives not designated as hedges in 2011 and 2010 respectively 



1 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 047 per mcf in 2011 and by 123 per mcf in 2 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 101 per bbl in 2011 and by 2231 per bbl in 

natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 836 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is primarily due to increased production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increased production is primarily due to increased production associated with our marcellus shale drilling program in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by decreases in production primarily in east and south texas due to normal production declines the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies and a shift from natural gas to oil projects 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 469 million is primarily due to increased production partially offset by lower realized oil prices the increase in production is primarily due to our drilling program in the eagle ford shale in south texas partially offset by lower production in east texas due to decreased activity 

brokered natural gas 



the decreased brokered natural gas margin of 15 million is primarily a result of a decrease in brokered volumes coupled with a decrease in the sales price that slightly outpaced the decrease in purchase price 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the increase  decrease to operating revenues from the realized impact of cash settlements for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and the net unrealized change in fair value of other financial derivative instruments 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increased by 334 million from 2010 to 2011 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• direct operations increased 78 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast pennsylvania as a result of the padep consent order and settlement agreement offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 2010 • transportation and gathering increased by 543 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2011 primarily in northeast pennsylvania • brokered natural gas decreased by 126 million from 2010 to 2011 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysis • taxes other than income decreased 103 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense • exploration decreased 63 million due to lower geological and geophysical costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in montana • depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 161 million of which 298 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower dda rate and a 14 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations the increase in depreciation and depletion was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 151 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities • impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by 409 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south texas fields recognized as a result of commodity price declines and 53 

limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010 there were no impairments in 2011 

• general and administrative increased by 255 million primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 251 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares due to changes in our stock price in 2011 compared 2010 higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase these increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the padep consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010 gain  loss on sale of assets 

during 2011 we recognized a gain of 342 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east texas and an aggregate gain of 292 million related to the sale of various other noncore assets during 2010 we recognized a gain of 493 million from the sale of our pennsylvania gathering infrastructure 407 million from the sale of our investment in tourmaline and an aggregate gain of 163 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year 

interest expense net 

interest expense and other increased by 37 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which increased to approximately 41 during the 2011 compared to approximately 38 during 2010 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of 3177 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of 3404 million during 2010 in addition in december 2010 we issued 175 million aggregate principal amount of 558 weightedaverage fixed rate notes which increased interest expense recognized in 2011 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 177 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 480 and 479 respectively the effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states primarily pennsylvania as a result of our continued focus on development of our marcellus shale properties 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the 

hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into commodity derivative instruments including collar and swap agreements to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

as of december 31 2012 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 



the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain  loss column in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2012 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks 

during 2012 natural gas and crude oil swaps covered 960 bcf or 38 and 1709 mbbl or 76 of natural gas and crude oil production at an average price of 522 per mcf and 10012 per bbl respectively natural gas basis swaps covered 17 bcf or 7 of our natural gas production at an average price of 025 per mcf natural gas collars with a floor price of 360 per mcf and a ceiling price of 417 per mcf covered 30 bcf or 1 of our natural gas production at an average price of 370 per mcf 

we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america bank of montreal goldman sachs jpmorgan and morgan stanley 

fair market value of other financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair values of longterm debt are as follows

 items 1 and 2 business and properties 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our primary areas of operation include appalachia east and south texas and oklahoma our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

overview 

on an equivalent basis our production in 2011 increased by 44 from 2010 we produced 1875 bcfe or 5137 mmcfe per day in 2011 as compared to 1306 bcfe or 3579 mmcfe per day in 2010 natural gas production increased by 534 bcf or 43 to 1788 bcf in 2011 from 1255 bcf in 2010 primarily due to increased production in the marcellus shale associated with our increased drilling program and upgrades to the lathrop compressor station in susquehanna county pennsylvania which included the commissioning of new compression during 2011 partially offsetting the production increase in northeast pennsylvania were decreases in production primarily in east and south texas due to normal production declines the sale of oil and gas properties in colorado utah and wyoming and a shift from gas to oil projects crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 584 mbbls or 68 from 859 mbbls in 2010 to 1443 mbbls in 2011 primarily due to an increase in production resulting from our eagle ford oil shale drilling program in south texas 

our average realized natural gas price for 2011 was 446 per mcf 22 lower than the 569 per mcf price realized in 2010 our average realized crude oil price for 2011 was 9049 per bbl 8 lower than the 9791 per bbl price realized in 2010 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 3033 bcfe at december 31 2011 of which 96 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 12 from 2701 bcfe at december 31 2010 on the strength of results from our drilling program in 2011 we had a net upward revision of 216 bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 2149 bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by a downward revision of 1898 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves that are no longer in our fiveyear development plan and a downward revision of 36 bcfe associated with decreased reserve commodity pricing for information about other changes in our proved reserves refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we drilled 161 gross wells 960 net with a success rate of over 99 compared to 113 gross wells 871 net with a success rate of 98 for the prior year in 2012 we plan to drill approximately 120 to 130 gross wells focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford oil shale in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma 

our 2011 total capital and exploration spending was 9055 million compared to 8915 million in 2010 this increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program and increases in our drilling programs in the eagle ford oil shale in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma in both 2011 and 2010 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2012 

funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility in 2012 we plan to spend between 750 and 790 million on capital and exploration activities 

while we consider acquisitions from time to time we remain focused on pursuing drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity including cash resources and available credit we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects in the current commodity pricing environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

divestitures 

in october 2011 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in colorado utah and wyoming to breitburn energy partners lp for 2850 million we received 2832 million in cash proceeds after closing adjustments and recognized a 42 million gain on sale of assets 

in may 2011 we sold certain of our unproved haynesville and bossier shale oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party we received approximately 470 million in cash proceeds and recognized a 342 million gain on sale of assets 

in 2011 we sold various other unproved properties and other assets for total proceeds of 735 million and recognized an aggregate gain of 250 million 

in december 2010 we sold our existing pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to williams field services williams a subsidiary of williams partners lp for 150 million under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we were obligated to construct pipelines to connect certain of our 2010 program wells complete the construction of the lathrop compressor station and complete taps into certain pipeline delivery points these obligations were completed in 2011 as of december 31 2010 we recognized a 493 million gain on sale of assets which included the accrual of 179 million associated with the obligations described above we also entered into a 25year firm gathering contract with williams that requires williams to complete construction of approximately 32 miles of high pressure pipeline 65 miles of trunklines and two compressor stations in susquehanna county pennsylvania in 2011 and 2012 additionally williams will connect all of our drilling program wells which will connect our production to five interstate pipeline delivery options 

in 2010 we sold various other proved and unproved properties and other assets for total proceeds of 322 million and recognized an aggregate gain of 163 million 

in april 2009 we sold substantially all of our canadian proved oil and gas properties to tourmaline oil corporation tourmaline in exchange for cash and common shares of tourmaline in november 2010 we sold our investment in tourmaline for 613 million and recognized a 407 million gain on sale of assets 

description of properties 

our properties are primarily located in appalachia east and south texas and oklahoma our activities in appalachia are concentrated primarily in northeast pennsylvania and in west virginia there are multiple producing intervals in appalachia that includes the devonian including marcellus big lime weir and berea shale formations at depths primarily ranging from approximately 950 to 7800 feet with an average depth of approximately 4375 feet principal producing intervals in east texas are in the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations and the principal producing intervals in south texas are in the eagle ford frio vicksburg and wilcox formations with total depths ranging from approximately 2650 to 19650 feet with an average depth of approximately 

11150 feet our activities in oklahoma include the marmaton chase morrow and chester formations in the anadarko basin at depths ranging from approximately 2350 to 18630 feet with an average depth of approximately 10490 feet we also hold undeveloped acreage in the rocky mountains located in montana and nevada 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3105 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and five local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2011 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

marketing 

the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern and midwestern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system in the gulf coast area and the midwestern united states we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

approximately 3540 of our natural gas sales volume in 2011 was sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one year or greater our remaining natural gas sales volume was sold under contracts with terms less than one year spot market sales are made at indexbased prices under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts 

in 2011 we produced and marketed approximately 4900 mmcf per day of natural gas and 40 mbbls of crude oilcondensatengl per day at market responsive prices average daily production in 2011 was 5137 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2011 was 1788 bcf and 1443 mbbls respectively 

in february 2012 we entered into a precedent agreement with constitution pipeline company llc a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp to develop and construct a large diameter pipeline to transport our production in northeast pennsylvania to both the new england and new york markets under the terms of the agreement we will own 500000 mcf per day of capacity on the newly constructed pipeline and acquire a 25 equity interest in the project subject to certain terms and conditions yet to be determined and regulatory approval 

risk management 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production while there are many different types of derivatives available we utilized natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and crude oil collar agreements for portions of our 2011 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively during 2011 we also entered into crude oil swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2012 production natural gas swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 and 2012 production and natural gas collars to hedge our price exposure on our 2013 production in addition we also have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting in 2010 and 2009 we utilized collars and swaps to hedge our price exposure on our production 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place 

for 2011 swaps covered 42 of natural gas production and 20 of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 530 per mcf and 10620 per bbl respectively and collars covered 26 of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 9088 per bbl 

as of december 31 2011 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 



we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

reserves 

our reserve estimates were based on decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations analogies or combinations of these methods for each well reservoir or field the proved reserve estimates presented herein were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum engineers miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of the proved reserves estimated by us and concluded the following in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller 

and lents ltd and other information about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents ltd dated january 31 2012 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k 

our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

internal control 

our corporate reservoir engineers report to the vice president of engineering and technology who maintains oversight and compliance responsibility for the internal reserve estimation process and provides oversight for the annual audit of our yearend reserves by our independent third party engineers miller and lents ltd our corporate reservoir engineering group consists of four petroleumchemical engineers with petroleumchemical engineering degrees and between one and 29 years of industry experience between one and 29 years of reservoir engineeringmanagement experience and between one and 13 years managing our reserves all four engineers are members of the society of petroleum engineers 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserve estimates at miller and lents ltd meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents ltd is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 

for additional information about the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see risk factors—our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated in item 1a 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2011 we had 12331 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves which represents an increase of 2562 bcfe compared with december 31 2010 for 2011 total capital related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves was 2845 million resulting in the conversion of 2287 bcfe of reserves to proved developed during 2011 we had 5563 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions and 1617 bcfe of positive proved undeveloped reserve performance revisions primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by sales of proved undeveloped reserves of 433 bcfe located in colorado utah wyoming and east texas and the removal of 1898 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves associated with drilling locations primarily in east texas west virginia and oklahoma no longer anticipated to be developed within the next five years primarily due to a continued shift in our drilling program 

historical reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves for the periods indicated 



1 proved undeveloped reserves for 2011 include 1324 bcfe of reserves drilled but awaiting completion 2 natural gas equivalents are determined using a ratio of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids 3 reserve life index is equal to yearend reserves divided by annual production for the year ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

production sales price and production costs 

the following table presents historical information about our production volumes for natural gas and crude oil including condensate and natural gas liquids average natural gas and crude oil realized sales prices and average production costs per equivalent including our dimock field located in northeast pennsylvania which contains more than 15 of our total proved reserves 



1 represents the average realized sales price for all production volumes and royalty volumes sold during the periods shown net of related costs principally purchased gas royalty includes realized impact of derivative instruments 

acreage 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to 10 years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established 

the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at december 31 2011 acreage in which our interest is limited to royalty and overriding royalty interests is excluded 



total net undeveloped acreage expiration 

our net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years as of december 31 2011 is 128463 197514 and 51518 for the years ending december 31 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively these amounts assume no future successful development or renewal of undeveloped acreage 

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership in productive natural gas and oil wells at december 31 2011 this summary includes natural gas and oil wells in which we have a working interest 



1 total excludes 55 523 net service wells 2 total percentage of gross operated wells is 890 

drilling activity 

we drilled wells participated in the drilling of wells or acquired wells as indicated in the table below 



at december 31 2011 12 wells 76 net were being drilled or awaiting completion 

other business matters 

competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that in the appalachia area our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems in west virginia and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years and storage fields in west virginia enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or 

services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources 

major customer 

in 2011 we did not have any one customer account for more than 10 of our total sales in 2010 one customer accounted for approximately 11 of our total sales in 2009 two customers accounted for approximately 13 and 11 respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things requiring market participants to report their gas 

sales transactions annually to the ferc and new regulations that require certain noninterstate pipelines to post daily scheduled volume information and design capacity for certain points on their systems the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties in an effort to add greater fairness consistency and transparency to its enforcement program 

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia are 96 complete and are expected to be fully complete by the december 2012 deadline clarification from the dot published in 2009 brought to light the need for further baseline assessments of cased pipeline crossings covered under our integrity management program reassessment of our west virginia pipeline system is scheduled to start in 2013 based on the 7 year reassessment requirement 

in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of 

pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulations 

in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirements 

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which have a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot on august 25 2011 the dot issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in which it explained that the dot is considering changes to the pipeline safety regulations including expanding its regulation of gas gathering lines 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 percent should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 another ferc matter that may impact our transportation costs relates to a policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an actual or potential income tax liability to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income we 

currently do not transport any of our oil or natural gas liquids on a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the fercs policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources 

and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read item 1a risk factors—federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the us congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act please read item 1a risk factors—climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for oil and gas

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile natural gas prices have decreased from an average price of 439 per mmbtu in 2010 to an average price of 404 per mmbtu in 2011 natural gas prices were 336 per mmbtu in december 2011 and have continued to decline to 268 per mmbtu in february 2012 natural gas prices represent the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu oil prices have increased from an average price of 7732 per barrel in 2010 to an average price of 9401 per barrel in 2011 depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our 

future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

• the level of consumer product demand • weather conditions • political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions including the middle east • the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls • the price of foreign imports • actions of governmental authorities • pipeline availability and capacity constraints • inventory storage levels • domestic and foreign governmental regulations • the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels and • overall economic conditions these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

• unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations • equipment failures or accidents • adverse weather conditions • compliance with governmental requirements and • shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location 

similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

• the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic data • the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects • the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled • economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews • our financial resources and results and • the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board fasb in accounting standards codification 932 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and 

oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2011 will increase at an estimated rate of 6 during 2012 and then decline at estimated rates of 30 22 and 16 during 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective often we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties if an acquired property is not performing as originally estimated we may have an impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

• the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business and • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

• well site blowouts cratering and explosions • equipment failures • pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids • uncontrolled flows of natural gas oil or well fluids • fires • formations with abnormal pressures • handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids • pollution and other environmental risks and • natural disasters any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2011 we owned or operated approximately 3105 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 110 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 31 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2011 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available of capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production while there are many different types of derivatives available we utilized natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and crude oil collar agreements for portions of our 2011 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively during 2011 we also entered into crude oil swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2012 production natural gas swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 and 2012 production and natural gas collars to hedge our price exposure on our 2013 production in addition we also have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index 

price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

• a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations • production is less than expected or • there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of 

hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and is developing guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive moreover legislation introduced in congress would require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids and we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg 

in addition to these federal legislative proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia texas kansas louisiana and montana and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the railroad commission of texas adopted rules in december 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process in addition both the state of pennsylvania and certain local governments in that state have adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed moreover in april 2011 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of last years total dissolved solids regulations further on july 22 2011 the pennsylvania governors marcellus shale advisory commission released its report setting forth 96 recommendations on a variety of issues related to natural gas development in pennsylvania these recommendations are related to infrastructure public health safety and environmental protection local impact and emergency response and economic and workforce development the commission made the most recommendations in the area of public health safety and environmental protection including doubling penalties authorized for violations of the oil and gas act increasing bonding requirements authorizing the padep to suspend revoke or deny permits on a quicker timeframe for violations or failure to correct violations expanding a well operators presumed liability for impaired water quality amending well stimulation and completion reporting requirements to require disclosure of hazardous chemicals used in fracturing and other issues related to fracturing operations some or all of these recommendations will likely be acted upon and may result in the adoption of new laws and regulations governing shale gas development in the marcellus shale in pennsylvania that could result in substantial changes in the way natural gas activities are conducted in the area if these types of conditions are imposed we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells 

certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administrationwide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and a committee of the us house of representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices furthermore a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater with initial results expected to be available by late 2012 and final results by 2014 in addition the us department of energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods also the us department of the interior is considering disclosure requirements or other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands 

additionally certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources the us securities and exchange commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agencys estimates regarding natural gas reserves including reserves from shale formations as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanisms 

further on july 28 2011 the epa issued proposed rules that would subject oil and gas production processing transmission storage and distribution operations to regulation under the new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps programs the epa proposed rules also include nsps standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells these standards include the reduced emission completion techniques developed in the epas natural gas star program along with the pit flaring of gas not sent to the gathering line the standards would be applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured further the proposed regulations under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for those glycol dehydrators and storage vessels at major sources of hazardous air pollutants not currently subject to mact standards we are currently evaluating the effect these proposed rules could have on our business final action on the proposed rules is expected by april 2012 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce 

there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases in the united states climate change action is evolving at the state regional and federal levels on december 17 2010 the epa amended the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule reporting rule originally issued in september 2009 the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epas endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however following issuance of the endangerment finding epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil also according to the epa the final motor vehicle ghg standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources thus on june 3 2010 epa issued a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process with the largest sources first subject to permitting in addition on november 8 2010 epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epas ghg reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year will now be required to report annual ghg emissions to epa with the first report due on september 28 2012 

internationally in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it international discussions are currently underway to extend the kyoto protocols expiration date of 2012 and to develop a treaty to replace the kyoto protocol after its expiration while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make estimating any future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change extremely challenging 

certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred increase in the taxation of foreign source income repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the 

liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

• for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders • for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law • under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and • for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

as a result of our production growth and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in 2011 we began separately reporting our transportation and gathering costs as a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations previously reported transportation and gathering costs were reflected as a component of natural gas revenues and have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation accordingly previously reported operating revenues and operating expenses have increased with no impact on previously reported net income

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read forwardlooking information for further details 

overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas liquids from its properties in the continental united states we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

we evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time that meet our strategic objectives at any one time one or more of these may not be economically feasible 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 446 per mcf and 9049 per bbl respectively in 2011 in an effort to manage commodity price risk we opportunistically enter into natural gas and crude oil price swaps and collars these financial instruments are a component of our risk management strategy 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and 

commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a 

the table below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2010 and 2011 index represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the 2010 and 2011 price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas derivative instruments as applicable 



  



the table below illustrates how crude oil prices have fluctuated by month over 2010 and 2011 index represents the nymex monthly average crude oil price the 2010 and 2011 price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative instruments 



  



natural gas revenues increased from 2010 to 2011 as a result of increased natural gas production partially offset by decreased commodity prices crude oil revenues increased from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to increased crude oil production partially offset by decreased realized prices prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments decreased by 22 for natural gas and 8 for crude oil 

we drilled 161 gross wells with a success rate of over 99 in 2011 compared to 113 gross wells with a success rate of 98 in 2010 total capital and exploration expenditures increased by 140 million to 9055 million in 2011 compared to 8915 million in 2010 the increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program and increases in our drilling programs in the eagle ford oil shale in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2012 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending between 750 and 790 million any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 

our 2012 strategy will remain consistent with 2011 while we consider acquisitions from time to time we remain focused on pursuing drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our 

accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity including cash resources and available credit for 2012 we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford oil shale in south texas and to a lesser extent the marmaton oil play in oklahoma we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current commodity pricing environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read forwardlooking information for further details 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2011 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations borrowings under our credit facility and the sales of properties and other assets during the year these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures in addition to repayments of debt and related interest contributions to our pension plans and dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 



operating activities 

key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating expenses net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased by 169 million over 2010 this increase was primarily due to increased operating income in 2011 as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses this increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 44 for 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 

22 for 2011 compared to 2010 average realized crude oil prices decreased by 8 compared to the same period 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 decreased by 1291 million over 2009 this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues and higher operating and interest expense average realized natural gas prices decreased by 25 in 2010 compared to 2009 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 14 over the same period equivalent production volumes increased by 27 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production 

see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods 

investing activities 

the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 1261 million from 2010 to 2011 and increased by 827 million from 2009 to 2010 the decrease from 2010 to 2011 was due to an increase of 1601 million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of 340 million in capital and exploration expenditures 

the increase from 2009 to 2010 was due to an increase of 2460 million in capital and exploration expenditures partially offset by an increase of 1633 million of proceeds from the sale of assets 

financing activities 

cash flows used in financing activities increased by 1849 million from 2010 to 2011 this was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of 1950 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 128 million 

at december 31 2011 we had 1880 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 49 and 7110 million available for future borrowing 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 2156 million from 2009 to 2010 this was primarily due to an increase in borrowings of 4200 million partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of 1880 million an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs by a total of 34 million and a decrease of 137 million in the tax benefit associated with stockbased compensation 

in december 2010 we completed a private placement of 1750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixedrate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 558 consisting of amounts due in january 2021 2023 and 2026 

in september 2010 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility credit facility to increase the available credit line to 900 million with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to 10 billion if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount and to extend the term to september 2015 the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes 

the amended facility provided for an initial 15 billion borrowing base effective april 1 2011 the lenders under our revolving credit facility approved an increase in our borrowing base from 15 billion to 17 billion as part of the annual redetermination under the terms of the credit facility our plan to sell certain oil and gas properties located in colorado utah and wyoming triggered an interim redetermination of our borrowing base and the 17 billion borrowing base was reaffirmed by the lenders effective september 27 2011 

in june 2010 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes to amend the required asset coverage ratio the present value of our proved reserves plus working capital to debt contained in the agreements the amendment also changed the ratio for maximum calculated indebtedness to borrowing base as defined in the credit facility agreement 

we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 



1 includes 1880 million and 2130 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively  

for the year ended december 31 2011 we paid dividends of 125 million 006 per share on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures 



we plan to drill approximately 120 to 130 gross wells in 2012 compared with 161 gross wells drilled in 2011 this 2012 drilling program includes between 750 and 790 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 9055 million in 2011 this decrease is primarily due to decreased drilling activity as a result of lower commodity prices we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

contractual obligations 

our material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments hydraulic fracturing services commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 are set forth in the following table 



1 interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our 7620 million longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2011 interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2011 outstanding balance of 1880 million will be outstanding through the september 2015 maturity date a constant interest rate of 49 was assumed which was the december 31 2011 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions  2 for further information on our obligations under gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments hydraulic fracturing services commitments and operating leases see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  

amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2011 was 601 million down from 723 million at december 31 2010 this decrease is primarily due to 121 million of liabilities divested 36 million in downward revisions of previous estimates and 12 million in liabilities settled partially offset by 33 million in accretion expense during 2011 and 15 million of liabilities incurred see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below 

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller  lents ltd independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 005 to 006 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 005 to 006 per mcfe impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under accounting standards codification asc 360 property plant and equipment due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved 

producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future

we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil 

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 238 million or decrease by approximately 156 million respectively per year 

as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

natural gas prices have decreased from an average price of 439 per mmbtu in 2010 to an average price of 404 per mmbtu in 2011 natural gas prices were 336 per mmbtu in december 2011 and have continued to decline to 268 per mmbtu in february 2012 natural gas prices represent the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu oil prices have increased from an average price of 7732 per barrel in 2010 to an average price of 9401 per barrel in 2011 any further decline in natural gas prices or quantities could result in an impairment of proved oil and gas properties 

asset retirement obligation 

the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement 

cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we follow the accounting prescribed in asc 815 under asc 815 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

the fair value of our derivative instruments are measured based on quotes from the companys counterparties such quotes have been derived using valuation models that consider various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the company measured the nonperformance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which it has derivative transactions in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 

employee benefit plans 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our projected pension obligation and related costs include discount rates expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases while the assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under asc 718 under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss the amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of topic 820 but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and ifrs the amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 early application is not permitted we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income this update was amended in december 2011 by asu no 201112 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105 this update defers only those changes in update 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments all other requirements in update 201105 are not affected by this update including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements asu no 201105 and 201112 are effective for fiscal years including interim periods beginning after december 15 2011 we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either 1 offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or 2 subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2011 we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under asc 360 property plant and equipment because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index falls the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions

results of operations 

2011 and 2010 compared 

we reported net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share during 2010 we reported net income of 1034 million or 050 per share net income increased in 2011 by 190 million primarily due to increased operating revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses decreased gain on sale of assets and increased income tax and interest expenses operating revenues increased by 1168 million largely due to increased natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset by a decrease in brokered natural gas revenues operating expenses increased by 334 million between periods primarily due to increases in transportation and gathering expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation depletion and amortization and direct operations partially offset by a decrease in impairment of oil and gas properties and lower brokered natural gas cost taxes other than income and exploration expense 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



1 natural gas revenues exclude the unrealized loss of 10 million and 02 million from the change in fair value of our derivatives not designated as hedges in 2011 and 2010 respectively  



1 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 047 per mcf in 2011 and by 123 per mcf in 2010  2 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 101 per bbl in 2011 and by 2231 per bbl in 2010  

natural gas revenues 

the increase in natural gas revenues of 836 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is primarily due to increased production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increased production is primarily due to increased production associated with our marcellus shale drilling program in northeast pennsylvania partially offset by decreases in production primarily in east and south texas due to normal production declines the sale of oil and gas properties in colorado utah and wyoming and a shift from gas to oil projects 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 469 million is primarily due to increased production partially offset by lower realized oil prices the increase in production is primarily due to our drilling program in the eagle ford oil shale in south texas partially offset by lower production in east texas due to decreased activity 

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 



the decreased brokered natural gas margin of 15 million is primarily a result of a decrease in brokered volumes coupled with a decrease in the sales price that slightly outpaced the decrease in purchase price 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increased by 334 million from 2010 to 2011 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• brokered natural gas cost decreased by 126 million from 2010 to 2011 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis • direct operations increased 78 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast pennsylvania as a result of the padep consent order and settlement agreement offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 2010 • transportation and gathering increased by 543 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2011 primarily in northeast pennsylvania • taxes other than income decreased 103 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense • exploration decreased 63 million due to lower geophysical and geological costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in montana • depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 161 million of which 298 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower dda rate of 164 per mcfe for 2011 compared to 212 per mcfe for 2010 and a 14 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations the increase in depletion and depreciation was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 151 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities 47 

• impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by 409 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south texas fields recognized as a result of continued price declines and limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010 there were no impairments in 2011 • general and administrative increased by 255 million primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 251 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares as a result of our higher average stock price for the month of december 2011 compared to the average stock price for the month of december 2010 higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase these increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the padep consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010 gain  loss on sale of assets 

during 2011 we recognized a gain of 342 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east texas and an aggregate gain of 292 million related to the sale of various other assets as part of our ongoing asset portfolio management program 

during 2010 we recognized a gain of 493 million from the sale of our pennsylvania gathering infrastructure 407 million from the sale of our investment in tourmaline and an aggregate gain of 163 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year 

interest expense net 

interest expense and other increased by 37 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which increased to approximately 41 during the 2011 compared to approximately 38 during 2010 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of 3177 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of 3404 million during 2010 in addition in december 2010 we issued 175 million aggregate principal amount of 558 weightedaverage fixed rate notes which increased interest expense recognized in 2011 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 177 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 480 and 479 respectively the effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states primarily pennsylvania as a result of our continued focus on development of our marcellus shale properties 

2010 and 2009 compared 

we reported net income for 2010 of 1034 million or 050 per share during 2009 we reported net income of 1483 million or 072 per share net income decreased in 2010 by 450 million primarily due to increased operating expenses income tax and interest expenses and decreased operating revenues partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets operating revenues decreased by 300 million largely due to decreases in natural gas and brokered natural gas revenues partially offset by an increase in crude oil and condensate revenues operating expenses increased by 954 million between periods due primarily to increases in depreciation depletion and amortization impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets general and administrative expense transportation and 

gathering and direct operations these increases were partially offset by decreases in brokered natural gas cost taxes other than income and exploration expense 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 



1 natural gas revenues exclude the unrealized loss from the change in fair value of our basis swaps of 02 million and 20 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively  



1 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 123 per mcf in 2010 and by 380 per mcf in 2009  2 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 2231 per bbl in 2010 and by 2885 per bbl in 2009  

natural gas revenues 

the decrease in natural gas revenue of 316 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is due primarily to the decrease in realized natural gas prices decreased production in east and south texas associated with normal production declines delays in completions and a shift from gas to oil projects as well as the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in natural gas production in the northeast pennsylvania associated with increased drilling and the start up of a portion of the lathrop compressor station in the marcellus shale at the end of the second quarter of 2010 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the 92 million increase in crude oil and condensate revenues is primarily due to an increase in realized crude oil prices and an increase in crude oil production in the eagle ford shale in south texas and the pettet formation production in east texas these increases are partially offset by lower 

production in west virginia and northeast pennsylvania as well as the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 



the increased brokered natural gas margin of 06 million is a result of a decrease in purchase price that outpaced the decrease in sales price partially offset by a decrease in volumes brokered 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 



operating and other expenses 



total costs and expenses from operations increased by 954 million from 2009 to 2010 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

• brokered natural gas cost decreased by 106 million from 2009 to 2010 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis • direct operations expenses increased by 57 million primarily due to lease maintenance expense and plug and abandonment costs in northeast pennsylvania related to plugging and abandoning three vertical wells in accordance with the padeps second modified consent order • transportation and gathering costs increased by 53 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2010 primarily in northeast pennsylvania • taxes other than income decreased by 68 million primarily due to decreased production and ad valorem taxes due to lower natural gas prices and property values partially offset by increased business and occupational taxes and franchise taxes • exploration expense decreased by 81 million primarily due to lower dry hole costs as a result of drilling one dry hole in 2010 compared to two dry holes in 2009 the decrease was partially offset by higher geophysical and geological expenses associated with seismic purchases related to our marcellus eagle ford and haynesville shale properties during 2010 • depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 758 million primarily due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by a lower dda rate of 212 per mcfe for 2010 compared to 214 per mcfe in 2009 amortization of unproved properties increased 176 million primarily due to increased unproved leasehold costs in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford oil shale in south texas in late 2009 and continuing into 2010 • impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets increased by 233 million from 2009 to 2010 impairments in 2010 consisted of a 358 million impairment of two south texas fields due to continued price declines and limited activity and a 51 million impairment related to drilling and service equipment impairments in 2009 consisted of a 176 million impairment of two fields in colorado and south texas due to lower well performance 51 

• general and administrative expenses increased by 108 million primarily due to a 99 million increase in legal expenses primarily related to the december 2010 padep consent order and settlement agreement ongoing litigation and related legal fees a 83 million increase in pension expense primarily due to termination and amendment of our pension plans and a 24 million increase in incentive compensation these increases were partially offset by an 85 million decrease in stock compensation expense primarily due to prior year awards that fully vested in february 2010 and a reduction in average stock price for the month of december 2010 compared to the average stock price for the month of december 2009 gain  loss on sale of assets 

during 2010 we recognized a gain of 493 million from the sale of our pennsylvania gathering infrastructure 407 million from the sale of our investment in tourmaline and an aggregate gain of 163 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year 

during 2009 we recognized a 160 million loss on sale of assets primarily due to the sale of our canadian properties partially offset by a 127 million gain on sale of assets related to the sale of oil and gas properties in west virginia 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased by 90 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to an increase in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances of approximately 3404 million during 2010 compared to approximately 1660 million during 2009 and to a lesser extent to the 1750 million of debt we issued in december 2010 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 38 during 2010 compared to approximately 40 during 2009 interest expense in 2010 also includes a makewhole premium payment of 28 million associated with the early payment of 750 million of the 733 fixed rate notes that were due in july 2011 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 202 million due to a higher effective tax rate offset by a decrease in our pretax income the effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 479 and 336 respectively the effective tax rate was higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states primarily in pennsylvania as a result of our increased focus on development of our marcellus shale properties 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 

derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to 

us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes as of december 31 2011 we had 37 derivative contracts open 23 natural gas price swap arrangements six natural gas basis swaps arrangements three crude oil price swap arrangements and five natural gas collar arrangements during 2011 we entered into 31 new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas and crude oil production for 2011 2012 and 2013 

as of december 31 2011 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 



the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain  loss column in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2011 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk of 14 million nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap and collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us 

we had natural gas price swaps covering 749 bcf or 42 of our 2011 natural gas production at an average price of 530 per mcf 

we had one crude oil swap covering 275 mbbl or 20 of our 2011 crude oil production at an average price of 10620 per bbl 

during 2011 crude oil collars covered 365 mbbl or 26 of total crude oil production at an average price of 9088 per bbl 

we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is 

generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america bank of montreal bnp paribas goldman sachs and jpmorgan 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities see forwardlooking information for further details 

fair market value of financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 

we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair values of longterm debt are as follows

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties located in the united states in 2009 we restructured our operations by combining our rocky mountain and appalachian areas to form the north region and combining the anadarko basin with our texas and louisiana areas to form the south region certain prior period amounts and historical descriptions have been reclassified to reflect this reorganization operationally we now have two primary regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

in 2010 natural gas prices decreased from the price levels experienced during 2009 while crude oil prices increased our 2010 average realized natural gas price was 554 per mcf 26 lower than the 2009 average realized price of 747 per mcf our 2010 average realized crude oil price was 9791 per bbl 14 higher than the 2009 average realized price of 8552 per bbl these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to the “results of operations” section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

in 2010 our investment program totaled 8915 million including lease acquisition 1307 million and drilling and facilities 6542 million programs our capital spending was funded through cash on hand operating cash flow borrowings on our revolving credit facility proceeds from our new senior notes offering and select asset sales 

we remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity including cash resources and available credit we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

in december 2010 we sold our existing pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to williams field services williams a subsidiary of williams partners lp for 150 million and recognized a 493 million gain on sale of assets under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement we are obligated to construct pipelines to connect certain of our 2010 program wells complete the construction of the lathrop compressor station and complete taps into certain pipeline delivery points we expect to complete these obligations in the first half of 2011 we also entered into a 25year firm gathering contract with williams that requires williams to complete construction of approximately 32 miles of high pressure pipeline 65 miles of trunklines in susquehanna county and build two compressor stations in the next two years additionally williams will connect all of our drilling program wells which will connect our production to five interstate pipeline delivery options 

in addition in december 2010 we closed a private placement of 175 million principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 558 

in september 2010 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to increase the available credit line to 900 million and with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to 10 billion if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount the amended facility provides for a 15 billion borrowing base and extends the term of the agreement to september 2015

in april 2009 we sold substantially all of our canadian properties to tourmaline oil corporation tourmaline in exchange for cash and common stock shares of tourmaline in november 2010 we sold our investment in tourmaline for 613 million and recognized a 407 million gain on sale of assets 

in 2010 we sold various other properties for total proceeds of 304 million and an aggregate gain of 153 million 

in august 2008 we completed the acquisition of producing properties leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east texas the “east texas acquisition” we paid total net cash consideration of approximately 6040 million in order to finance the east texas acquisition we completed a public offering of 5002500 shares of our common stock in june 2008 receiving net proceeds of 3135 million and we closed a private placement in july 2008 of 425 million principal amount of 651 weighted average senior unsecured fixed rate notes 

on an equivalent basis our production level in 2010 increased by 27 from 2009 we produced 1306 bcfe or 3579 mmcfe per day in 2010 as compared to 1030 bcfe or 2821 mmcfe per day in 2009 natural gas production increased to 1255 bcf in 2010 from 979 bcf in 2009 primarily due to increased production in the north region associated with the increased drilling program and the lathrop compressor station in susquehanna county pennsylvania the decline in the other areas is related to natural production decline oil production decreased by 10 mbbls from 818 mbbls in 2009 to 808 mbbls in 2010 due primarily to a decrease in production in the north and a decrease in production in canada due to the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 partially offset by increased production in the south region associated with the eagle ford shale and pettet formation production 

for the year ended december 31 2010 we drilled 113 gross wells 871 net with a success rate of 98 compared to 143 gross wells 1186 net with a success rate of 95 for the prior year in 2011 we plan to drill approximately 110 gross wells 831 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas 

our 2010 total capital and exploration spending was 8915 million compared to 6404 million in 2009 in both 2010 and 2009 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2011 funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility for 2011 the north region is expected to receive approximately 58 of the anticipated capital program with the remaining 42 dedicated to the south region in 2011 we plan to spend approximately 600 million on capital and exploration activities 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 2701 bcfe at december 31 2010 of which 98 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 31 from 2060 bcfe at december 31 2009 on the strength of results from our drilling program in 2010 we had a net upward revision of 1367 bcfe which was primarily due to an upward performance revision of 2844 bcfe primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania and an upward revision of 350 bcfe associated with increased reserve commodity pricing partially offset by a downward revision of 1827 bcfe 1151 bcfe in the north region and 676 bcfe in the south region of proved undeveloped reserves that are no longer in our fiveyear development plan

the following table presents certain reserve production and well information as of december 31 2010 

 

  

  our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to ten years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established we own leasehold rights on approximately 23 million gross acres in addition we own fee interest in approximately 02 million gross acres primarily in west virginia our largest field dimock which is our only field that contains more than 15 of our proved reserves is located in northeast pennsylvania this field makes up approximately 46 of our proved reserves 

the following table presents certain information with respect to our dimock field 

 

  

 north region 

the north region is comprised of the appalachian and rocky mountains areas our activities in the appalachian area are concentrated primarily in northeast pennsylvania and in west virginia our activities in the rocky mountains area are concentrated in the green river and washakie basins in wyoming this region is managed from our office in pittsburgh pennsylvania in this region our assets include a large acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity in december 2010 we sold our existing pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations in july 2010 we sold our properties in the paradox basin in colorado 

capital and exploration expenditures for 2010 were 6036 million or 68 of our total 2010 capital and exploration expenditures compared to 3803 million for 2009 or 60 of our total 2009 capital and exploration 

  

 6  

expenditures this increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania to hold acreage for 2011 we have budgeted approximately 3500 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

at december 31 2010 we had 4185 wells 35885 net of which 3724 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals in the appalachian area that includes the big lime weir berea and devonian including marcellus shale formations at depths primarily ranging from 950 to 7800 feet with an average depth of approximately 4050 feet in the rocky mountains area principal producing intervals are in the almond frontier and dakota formations at depths ranging from 8100 to 14375 feet with an average depth of approximately 11050 feet 

natural gas production and reserves in the north region are primarily associated with the marcellus shale at december 31 2010 we had 20072 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the north region constituting 74 of our total proved reserves developed and undeveloped reserves made up 12513 bcfe and 7559 bcfe of the total proved reserves for the north region respectively 

in 2010 we drilled 63 wells 613 net in the north region of which 62 wells 603 net were development and extension wells in 2011 we plan to drill approximately 54 wells 540 net primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania 

in 2010 we produced and marketed approximately 2218 mmcf per day of natural gas and 2725 barrels of crude oilcondensatengl per day in the north region at market responsive prices average daily production in 2010 was 2234 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2010 was 810 bcf and 100 mbbls respectively 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operated a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3148 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2010 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the north region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

the principal markets for our north region natural gas are in the northeastern and northwestern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system approximately 42 of our natural gas sales volume in the north region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one year or greater the remaining 58 of our natural gas sales volume is sold under contracts with terms less than one year spot market sales are made at indexbased prices under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts

south region 

our development exploitation exploration and production activities in the south region are primarily concentrated in east and south texas and oklahoma a regional office in houston manages the operations principal producing intervals are in the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas the eagle ford frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas and the chase morrow and chester formations in the anadarko basin in oklahoma at measured depths ranging from approximately 2500 to 17700 feet with an average depth of approximately 8950 feet we sold our woodford shale prospect located in oklahoma in june 2010 and certain oil and gas properties in the texas panhandle in november 2010 

capital and exploration expenditures were 2804 million for 2010 or 32 of our total 2010 capital and exploration expenditures compared to 2376 million for 2009 or 37 of our total 2009 capital and exploration expenditures this increase in capital spending is primarily due to lease acquisitions to establish a greater position in the oil window of the eagle ford shale for 2011 we have budgeted approximately 250 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region our 2011 south region drilling program will emphasize activity primarily in the eagle ford shale in south texas 

we had 1769 wells 12311 net in the south region as of december 31 2010 of which 1345 wells are operated by us average daily production in 2010 was 1344 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2010 was 445 bcf and 759 mbbls respectively 

at december 31 2010 we had 6939 bcfe of proved reserves 93 natural gas in the south region which represented 26 of our total proved reserves developed and undeveloped reserves made up 4729 bcfe and 2210 bcfe of the total proved reserves for the south region respectively 

in 2010 we drilled 50 wells 258 net in the south region of which 47 wells 233 net were development and extension wells in 2011 we plan to drill 56 wells 291 net primarily in the eagle ford shale in south texas 

our principal markets for the south region natural gas are in the industrialized gulf coast area and the midwestern united states we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies currently approximately 83 of our natural gas sales volumes in the south region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one year or greater the remaining 17 of our natural gas sales volumes are sold at indexbased prices under shortterm agreements the south region properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

in 2010 we produced and marketed approximately 1220 mmcf per day of natural gas and 20791 barrels of crude oilcondensatengl per day in the south region at market responsive prices average daily production in 2010 was 1344 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2010 was 445 bcf and 759 mbbls respectively 

risk management 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2010 we employed natural gas and crude oil swap agreements for portions of our 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively during 2010 we also entered into crude oil swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2010 production natural gas swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production and crude oil price collars to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production in addition we also have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting in 2009 and 2008 we employed price collars and swaps to hedge our price exposure on our production 

  

 8  

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place 

for 2010 swaps covered 29 of natural gas production and 90 of crude oil production and had a weightedaverage price of 930 per mcf and 10425 per bbl respectively 

as of december 31 2010 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 

 

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

reserves 

current reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves at december 31 2010 

 

  

  our reserve estimates were based on decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations analogies or combinations of these methods for each well 

the proved reserve estimates presented herein were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum engineers miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of the proved reserves estimated by us and concluded the following in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and 

  

 9  

project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our reserves estimation processes were comprehensive and of sufficient depth 3 the data upon which we relied were adequate and of sufficient quality and 4 the results of our estimates and projections are in the aggregate reasonable for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the audit of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the audit letter by miller and lents ltd dated february 1 2011 has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on the economic productive life of producing properties our reserves are based on 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during 2010 increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves to be recognized decreases in prices may result in negative impacts of this nature 

internal control 

our corporate reservoir engineers report to the director of engineering who maintains oversight and compliance responsibility for the internal reserve estimation process and provides oversight for the annual audit of our yearend reserves by our independent third party engineers miller and lents ltd our corporate reservoir engineering group consists of two petroleumchemical engineers with petroleumchemical engineering degrees and between 11 and 28 years of industry experience between four and 28 years of reservoir engineeringmanagement experience and between three and 12 years managing our reserves both are members of the society of petroleum engineers 

qualifications of third party engineers 

the technical person primarily responsible for audit of our reserve estimates at miller and lents ltd meets the requirements regarding qualifications independence objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers miller and lents ltd is an independent firm of petroleum engineers geologists geophysicists and petro physicists they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis 

for additional information about the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see “risk factors—our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in item 1a 

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2010 we had 9769 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves which represents an increase of 2417 bcfe compared with december 31 2009 for 2010 total capital related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves was 1834 million resulting in the conversion of 2169 bcfe of reserves to proved developed during 2010 we had 3918 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions and 2495 bcfe of positive proved undeveloped reserve performance revisions primarily in the dimock field in northeast pennsylvania lastly we removed 1827 bcfe 1151 bcfe in the north region and 676 bcfe in the south region of proved undeveloped reserves associated with drilling locations no longer anticipated to be developed within the next five years

 14  

competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that in the north region our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems in west virginia services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years and storage fields in west virginia enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources 

other business matters 

major customer 

in 2010 one customer accounted for approximately 11 of the company’s total sales in 2009 two customers accounted for approximately 13 and 11 respectively of the company’s total sales in 2008 one customer accounted for approximately 16 of the company’s total sales 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the 

  

 15  

provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc and new regulations that require certain noninterstate pipelines to post daily scheduled volume information and design capacity for certain points on their systems the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc’s regulations in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties in an effort to add greater fairness consistency and transparency to its enforcement program 

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments for our pipeline system in west virginia are 95 completed clarification from the dot published in 2009 brought to light the need for further baseline assessments of cased pipeline crossings covered under our integrity management program with this exception reassessment of our west virginia pipeline system is scheduled to start in 2013 based on the 7 year reassessment requirement we have completed 100 of the required initial inspection baseline assessment under our integrity management program of our pipeline systems in west virginia in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections 

  

 16  

on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 in a proposed rulemaking issued september 17 2010 the dot proposed to expedite the program implementation deadline to august 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which would have a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 on november 26 2010 the dot updated its reporting requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines to be effective january 1 2011 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 percent should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 another ferc matter that may impact our transportation costs relates to a policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or potential income tax liability” to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income we currently do not transport any of our oil or natural gas liquids on a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the ferc’s policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

  

 17  

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act  the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally 

  

 18  

resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however bills have recently been introduced in congress that would subject hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the safe drinking water act if adopted these bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive moreover the bills introduced in congress would require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids many of which are proprietary to the service companies that perform the hydraulic fracturing operations such disclosure could make it easier for third parties to initiate litigation against us in the event of perceived problems with drinking water wells in the vicinity of an oil or gas well or other alleged environmental problems in addition to these federal legislative proposals some states and local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including but not limited to requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example both the state of pennsylvania and certain local governments in that state have adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed if these types of conditions are adopted we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells 

greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere the us congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 for example the 110th session of congress considered various bills that proposed a “cap and trade” scheme of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that generally would ban emissions above a defined reducing annual cap covered parties would be authorized to emit greenhouse emissions through the acquisition and subsequent surrender of emission allowances that may be traded or acquired on the open market in addition at least 17 states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs require either major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries or gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved 

depending on the particular program we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations or from combustion of oil or natural gas we produce although we would not be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated producers of oil and gas a stringent greenhouse gas control program could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce 

also in the wake of the us supreme court’s decision in april 2007 in massachusetts v environmental protection agency  the epa has begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions even though congress has yet to adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases in late 2009 the epa issued a “mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases” final rule which was amended in 

  

 19  

december 2010 establishing a new comprehensive regulation and reporting scheme for operators of stationary sources emitting certain levels of greenhouse gases and a final rule finding that certain current and projected levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations most recently in late 2010 the epa finalized new greenhouse gas reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epa’s greenhouse gas reporting rule please read “item 1a risk factors—climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for oil and gas”

 item 1a risk factors tableend natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile natural gas prices have increased from an average price of 399 per mmbtu in 2009 to an average price of 439 per mmbtu in 2010 oil prices have increased from an average price of 6180 per barrel in 2009 to an average price of 7732 per barrel in 2010 depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

   

 20  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 21  

these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board fasb in accounting standards codification 932 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed producing reserves as of december 31 2010 will increase at an estimated rate of 30 during 2011 and then decline at estimated rates of 22 22 and 15 during 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

  

 22  

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective often we acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties if an acquired property is not performing as originally estimated we may have an impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert management’s attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert management’s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 

  

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these 

  

 23  

risks as of december 31 2010 we owned or operated approximately 3150 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

bills have recently been introduced in congress that would subject hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the safe drinking water act if adopted these bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive moreover the bills introduced in congress would require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids many of which are proprietary to the service companies that perform the hydraulic fracturing operations such disclosure could make it easier for third parties to initiate litigation against us in the event of perceived problems with drinking water wells in the vicinity of an oil or gas well or other alleged environmental problems in addition to these federal legislative proposals some states and local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example both the state of pennsylvania and certain local governments in that state have adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed if these types of conditions are adopted we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 149 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 46 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2010 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operator’s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator’s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 24  

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2010 we employed natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements for portions of our 2010 production and natural gas price swap agreements and crude oil collar agreements for portions of our anticipated 2011 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively in addition we have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting 

the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 

  

  

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or 

  

 25  

more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce 

there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases in the united states climate change action is evolving at state regional and federal levels on december 17 2010 the epa amended the “mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases” final rule “reporting rule” originally issued in september 2009 the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epa’s endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however following issuance of the endangerment finding epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil also according to the epa the final motor vehicle ghg standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources thus on june 3 2010 epa issued a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act’s prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v programs this final rule “tailors” the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process with the largest sources first subject to permitting most recently on november 8 2010 epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epa’s ghg reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year will now be required to report annual ghg emissions to epa with the first report due on march 31 2012 

however following issuance of the endangerment finding the epa promulgated final motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil also according to the epa the final motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards will trigger 

  

 26  

construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources thus on june 3 2010 the epa issued a final rule to address permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act’s prevention of significant deterioration “psd” and title v programs this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in a multistep process with the largest sources first subject to permitting most recently on november 8 2010 the epa finalized new greenhouse gas reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to the reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of c02 equivalent per year will now be required to report annual ghg emissions to the epa with the first report due on march 31 2012 

internationally in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it international discussions are currently underway to develop a treaty to replace the kyoto protocol after its expiration in 2012 while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas 

moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make estimating any future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change extremely challenging 

the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year 2012 includes certain provisions that if passed as originally submitted will have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

on february 14 2011 the office management and budget released a summary of the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year 2012 and the treasury department released a general explanation of tax related proposals in such budget the proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes the provisions include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred increase in the taxation of foreign source income repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these provisions become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals 

  

 27  

may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors’ duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 

  

  

  

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

environmental matters 

on november 4 2009 the company and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep entered into a single settlement agreement consent order covering a number of separate unrelated environmental issues occurring in 2008 and 2009 including releases of drilling mud and other substances record keeping violations at various wells and alleged natural gas contamination of 13 water wells in susquehanna county pennsylvania the company paid an aggregate 120000 civil penalty with respect to all the matters covered by the consent order which were consolidated at the request of the padep 

on april 15 2010 the company and padep reached agreement on modifications to the consent order first modified consent order in the first modified consent order padep and the company agreed that the 

  

 28  

company will provide a permanent source of potable water to 14 households most of which the company has already been supplying with water the company agreed to plug and abandon three vertical wells in close proximity to two of the households and to bring into compliance a fourth well in the nine square mile area of concern in susquehanna county the company agreed to complete these actions prior to any new well drilling permits being issued for drilling in pennsylvania and prior to initiating hydraulic fracturing of seven wells already drilled in the area of concern the company also agreed to postpone drilling of new wells in the area of concern until all obligations under the consent orders are fulfilled in addition the company agreed to take certain other actions if requested by padep which could include the plugging and abandonment of up to 10 additional wells under the first modified consent order the company paid a 240000 civil penalty and agreed to pay an additional 30000 per month until all obligations under the first modified consent order are satisfied 

on july 19 2010 the company and the padep entered a second modification to consent order second modified consent order under which the company and the padep agreed that the company has satisfactorily plugged and abandoned the three vertical wells and brought the fourth well into compliance as a result the company and the padep agreed that the padep will commence the processing and issuance of new well drilling permits outside the area of concern so long as the company continues to provide temporary potable water and offers to provide gaswater separators to the 14 households no penalties were assessed under the second modified consent order 

as required by the second modified consent order the company made offers to provide wholehouse water treatment systems to the 14 households as required by the first modified consent order on august 5 2010 the company filed with the padep its report prepared by its experts finding that the company’s well drilling and development activities are not the source of methane gas reported to be in the groundwater and water wells in the area of concern 

despite the company’s vigorous efforts to comply with the various consent orders in a september 14 2010 letter to the company the padep rejected the company’s expert report and determined that the company’s drilling activities continue to cause the unpermitted discharge of natural gas into the groundwater and continue to affect residential water supplies in the area of concern the padep directed the company in accordance with the first modified consent order to plug or take other remedial actions at the remaining 10 wells and to contact the padep to discuss connecting the impacted water supplies into a community public water system to permanently eliminate the continuing adverse affect to those water supplies 

the company believed that it was in full compliance with the various consent orders in a september 28 2010 reply letter to the padep the company disagreed with the padep’s rejection of the company’s expert report disagreed that the remaining 10 wells continue to impact groundwater and affect residential water supplies and disagreed that a community public water system is necessary or feasible it was the company’s position that offering installation of a wholehouse water treatment system to the 14 households constituted compliance with the company’s obligations under these consent orders 

on december 15 2010 the company entered a global settlement agreement and new consent order with the padep global settlement agreement which supersedes the consent order the first modified consent order and the second modified consent order under the global settlement agreement among other things the company agreed to pay 42 million into separate escrow accounts for the benefit of each affected household pay 500000 to the padep to reimburse the padep for its costs remediate two wells in the affected area provide pressure water quality and well headspace data to the padep and offer water treatment to the affected households the global settlement agreement settles all outstanding issues and claims that are known and that could have been brought against the company by the padep relating to the wells in the affected area and the consent order the first modified consent order and the second modified consent order it also allows the company to begin hydraulic fracturing in the affected areas after providing the padep with well pressure data and to commence drilling new wells in the affected area in the second quarter of 2011 under the global settlement agreement the company has no obligation to connect the impacted water supplies to a community public water system 

  

 29  

on january 11 2011 certain of the affected households appealed the global settlement agreement to the pennsylvania environmental hearing board a hearing on the merits of this appeal is not expected to occur until 2012 

as of december 31 2010 the company has paid 13 million in fines and penalties to the padep paid 06 million to two of the affected households and accrued a 36 million settlement liability related to this matter which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

in 2009 we reorganized our operations by combining the rocky mountain and appalachian areas to form the north region and by combining the anadarko basin with our texas and louisiana areas to form the south region additionally we exited canada through the sale of our properties in april 2009 prior to the third quarter of 2009 we presented our geographic areas as east gulf coast west and canada certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in presenting the geographic areas in which we conduct our operations 

  

 33  

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively within the united states 

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas crude oil and to a lesser extent natural gas liquids from its properties in the continental united states we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

we evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time at any one time one or more of these may not be economically feasible 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 554 per mcf and 9791 per bbl respectively in 2010 and were significantly increased by our positions from our derivative instruments which contributed approximately 22 of our realized revenues in 2010 in an effort to manage commodity price risk we opportunistically enter into crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars these financial instruments are a component of our risk management strategy 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see “risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business” and “risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable” in item 1a 

the table below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2009 and 2010 “index” represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2009” and “2010” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas derivative instruments as applicable 

 

   

 34  

the table below illustrates how crude oil prices have fluctuated by month over 2009 and 2010 “index” represents the nymex monthly average crude oil price and our realized per barrel bbl crude oil prices by month for 2009 and 2010 the “2009” and “2010” price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative instruments 

 

 natural gas revenues decreased from 2009 to 2010 as a result of decreased commodity market prices partially offset by increased natural gas production crude oil revenues increased slightly from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to increased realized prices partially offset by decreased crude oil production prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments decreased by 26 for natural gas and increased by 14 for oil 

we drilled 113 gross wells with a success rate of 98 in 2010 compared to 143 gross wells with a success rate of 95 in 2009 total capital and exploration expenditures increased by 2511 million to 8915 million in 2010 compared to 6404 million in 2009 this increase was due to a 2306 million increase in the north region substantially driven by an expanded marcellus horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania to hold acreage and 428 million in the south region due to due to an increase in lease acquisitions to establish a greater position in the oil window of the eagle ford shale we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2011 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately 600 million any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 

our 2011 strategy will remain consistent with 2010 we will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity including cash resources and available credit in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2010 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations borrowings under our revolving credit facility issuance of private placement debt and the sales of properties and other assets during the year these cash flows were primarily used to fund our development and exploratory expenditures in addition to repayments for debt and related interest payments for debt issuance costs contributions to our pension plan and dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

  

 35  

we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see “results of operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 

 

 operating activities key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 decreased by 1291 million over 2009 this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues and higher operating and interest expense average realized natural gas prices decreased by 26 in 2010 compared to 2009 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 14 over the same period equivalent production volumes increased by 27 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher natural gas production we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may continue to decline during 2011 

for 2010 we had natural gas price swaps covering 359 bcf or 29 of our 2010 natural gas production at an average price of 930 per mcf we also had crude oil price swaps covering 730 mmbl or 90 of our 2010 crude oil production at an average price of 10425 per bbl as of december 31 2010 we have natural gas price swaps covering 129 bcf of our 2011 gas production at an average price of 624 per mcf and crude oil collars covering 365 mbbls of our 2011 crude oil production with a floor of 8000 per bbl and a ceiling of 9325 per bbl accordingly based on our current hedge position we will be more subject to the effects of natural gas and crude oil price volatility in 2011 than in 2010 in addition given the current market for derivatives if we were to hedge all our 2011 production we would expect our realized prices to be lower than our 2010 realized prices 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased by 204 million over 2008 this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues partially offset by lower operating interest and tax expense average realized natural gas prices decreased by 11 in 2009 compared to 2008 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 4 over the same period equivalent production volumes increased by 8 in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production 

see “results of operations” for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital 

  

 36  

expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities increased by 827 million from 2009 to 2010 and decreased by 9213 million from 2008 to 2009 the increase from 2009 to 2010 was due to an increase of 2464 million in acquisitions and capital and exploration expenditures partially offset by an increase of 1633 million of proceeds from the sale of assets 

the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due to a decrease of 8432 million in acquisitions and capital expenditures and an increase of 781 million of proceeds from the sale of assets in august 2008 we completed the acquisition of producing properties leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east texas for total net cash consideration of approximately 6040 million 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 2156 million from 2009 to 2010 this was primarily due to an increase in borrowings of 4200 million partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of 1880 million an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs by a total of 34 million and a decrease of 137 million in the tax benefit associated with stockbased compensation 

cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 8984 million from 2008 to 2009 this was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings from debt of 787 million partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of 208 million and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of 3161 million primarily due to our june 2008 issuance of common stock in a public offering common stock proceeds and debt borrowings in 2008 were largely used to finance the acquisition of east texas properties and undeveloped acreage cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs and dividends increased by a total of 64 million partially offset by an increase of 31 million in the tax benefit associated with stockbased compensation 

at december 31 2010 we had 2130 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 31 

in december 2010 we completed a private placement of 1750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixedrate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 558 consisting of amounts due in january 2021 2023 and 2026 

in september 2010 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility to increase the available credit line to 900 million with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to 10 billion if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount and to extend the term to september 2015 the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes the amended facility provides for a 15 billion borrowing base we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt as of december 31 2010 our available credit under our credit facility is 5250 million 

in june 2010 we amended the agreements governing our credit facility and senior notes to amend the required asset coverage ratio the present value of our proved reserves plus working capital to debt contained in the agreements the amendment also changed the ratio for maximum calculated indebtedness to borrowing base as defined in the credit facility agreement 

in july 2008 we completed a private placement of 425 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixedrate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 651 consisting of amounts due in july 2018 2020 and 2023 in december 2008 we completed a private placement of 67 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 978 fixedrate notes due in december 2018 

  

 37  

in june 2008 we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5002500 shares of common stock at a price to us of 6266 per share we received 3135 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions these net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east texas acquisition which closed in the third quarter of 2008 immediately prior to and in connection with this issuance we retired 5002500 shares of treasury stock which had a weightedaverage purchase price of 1646 

management believes that with internally generated cash existing cash and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position at the same time we will closely monitor the capital markets 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

  

 for the year ended december 31 2010 we paid dividends of 125 million 012 per share on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2010 

 

  

   

 38  

we plan to drill approximately 110 gross wells 831 net in 2011 compared with 113 gross wells 871 net drilled in 2010 this 2011 drilling program includes approximately 600 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 8915 million in 2010 this decline is primarily due to the lower well count together with lower projected lease acquisition expenditures as the result of our reduced program spending due to lower commodity prices and reduced infrastructure investments we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization dda rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods in 2011 management expects a small decrease in our dda rate primarily due to increased production and reserve additions in the marcellus shale such changes in our dda rate and related expense do not have an impact on our cash flows 

contractual obligations 

our material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 are set forth in the following table 

 

  

   amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2010 was 723 million up from 297 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to 404 million in revisions of previous estimates due to increased plugging and abandonment costs and 19 million in accretion expense during 2010 see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below 

  

 39  

successful efforts method of accounting 

we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 

our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller  lents ltd independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the “supplemental oil and gas information” 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 010 to 012 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 006 to 007 per mcfe impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under accounting standards codification asc 360 “property plant and equipment” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil 

  

 40  

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 173 million or decrease by approximately 123 million respectively per year 

in the past based on the customary terms of the leases the average leasehold life in the south region has been shorter than the average life in the north region average property lives in the north and south regions have been five and three years respectively as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 

asset retirement obligation 

the majority of our asset retirement obligation relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense is reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we follow the accounting prescribed in asc 815 under asc 815 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

the fair value of our derivative instruments are measured based on quotes from the company’s counterparties such quotes have been derived using valuation models that consider various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the company measured the nonperformance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which it has derivative transactions in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 

  

 41  

employee benefit plans 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our projected pension obligation and related costs include discount rates expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases while the assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under asc 718 under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production” “natural gas marketing gathering and transportation” “federal regulation of petroleum” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 in addition we are required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of 175 to 10 and a current ratio of 10 to 10 our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 at december 31 2010 we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see “risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity

ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under asc 360 “property plant and equipment” because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index falls the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

settlement of dispute in december 2008 we settled a dispute with a third party and as a result recorded a gain of 519 million the dispute involved the propriety of possession of our intellectual property by a third party the settlement was comprised of 202 million in cash paid by the third party to us and 317 million related to the fair value of unproved property rights transferred by the third party to us the fair market value of the unproved property rights was determined based on observable market costs and conditions over a recent time period values were prorated by property based on the primary term remaining on the properties

results of operations 

2010 and 2009 compared 

we reported net income for 2010 of 1034 million or 099 per share during 2009 we reported net income of 1483 million or 143 per share net income decreased in 2010 by 450 million primarily due to increased operating income tax and interest expenses and decreased operating revenues partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets operating revenues decreased by 352 million largely due to decreases in natural gas and brokered natural gas revenues partially offset by an increase in crude oil and condensate revenues operating expenses increased by 902 million between periods due primarily to increases in depreciation depletion and amortization impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets general and administrative expense and direct operations these increases were partially offset by decreases in brokered natural gas cost taxes other than income and exploration expense 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 

 

  

  

  

    

 44  

natural gas revenues 

the decrease in natural gas revenue of 369 million excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses discussed above is due primarily to the decrease in realized natural gas prices decreased production in the south region associated with normal production declines delays in completions and a shift from gas to oil projects as well as the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in natural gas production in the north region associated with increased drilling and the start up of a portion of the lathrop compressor station in the marcellus shale at the end of the second quarter of 2010 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the 92 million increase in crude oil and condensate revenues is primarily due to an increase in realized crude oil prices and an increase in crude oil production in the south region associated with the eagle ford shale and pettet formation production these increases are partially offset by lower production in the north region as well as the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the increased brokered natural gas margin of 06 million is a result of a lesser decrease in sales price than in purchase price partially offset by a decrease in volumes brokered 

  

 45  

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 operating and other expenses 

 

 total costs and expenses from operations increased by 902 million from 2009 to 2010 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

   

 46  

  

  

  

  

 gain  loss on sale of assets 

gain  loss on sale of assets increased by 1096 million from 2009 to 2010 during 2010 we recognized a gain of 493 million from the sale of our pennsylvania gathering infrastructure 407 million from the sale of our investment in tourmaline 108 million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the texas panhandle 103 million on the sale of our woodford shale properties partially offset by an impairment loss of 51 million on certain oil and gas properties in colorado 

during 2009 we recognized a 160 million loss on sale of assets primarily due to the sale of the canadian properties partially offset by a 127 million gain on sale of assets related to the sale of our thornwood properties in the north region 

interest expense net 

interest expense net increased by 90 million from 2009 to 2010 primarily due to an increase in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances of approximately 3404 million during 2010 compared to approximately 166 million during 2009 and to a lesser extent to the 1750 million of debt we issued in december 2010 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 38 during 2010 compared to approximately 40 during 2009 interest expense in 2010 also includes a makewhole premium payment of 28 million associated with the early payment of 750 million of the 733 fixed rate notes that were due in july 2011 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 202 million due to a higher effective tax rate offset by a decrease in our pretax income the effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 479 and 336 respectively the effective tax rate was higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states primarily in pennsylvania as a result of our increased focus on development of our marcellus shale properties 

  

 47  

2009 and 2008 compared 

we reported net income for 2009 of 1483 million or 143 per share during 2008 we reported net income of 2113 million or 210 per share net income decreased in 2009 by 630 million primarily due to decreased operating revenues and increased operating expenses partially offset by increased gain on sale of assets operating revenues decreased by 665 million largely due to decreases in brokered natural gas and natural gas revenues operating expenses decreased by 331 million between periods due primarily to decreases in brokered natural gas costs taxes other than income and general and administrative expenses partially offset by increased depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expense and direct operations in addition net income was impacted in 2009 by higher interest expense decreased income tax expense and to a lesser extent loss on sale of assets income tax expense was lower in 2009 as a result of a decrease in operating income as discussed above and a decrease in the effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits 

revenue price and volume variances 

below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances 

 

  

  

  

  natural gas revenues 

the decrease in natural gas revenue of 271 million excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses discussed above is almost entirely due to the sale of our canadian properties and a decrease in realized natural gas prices that was essentially offset by an increase in natural gas production this increase in natural gas 

  

 48  

production was primarily a result of increased production in the north region associated with the initiation of production in susquehanna county pennsylvania in the third quarter of 2008 and increased drilling in the marcellus shale prospect in susquehanna county as well as increased natural gas production in the south region associated with the properties we acquired in east texas in august 2008 and drilling in the angie field partially offsetting these production gains were decreases in production in canada due to the sale of substantially all of our canadian properties in april 2009 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

the increase in crude oil production partially offset by a decrease in realized crude oil prices resulted in a net revenue increase of 02 million the increase in crude oil production was primarily the result of increased production in the south region associated with the properties we acquired in the east texas acquisition in august 2008 and an increase related to pettet formation production in the angie field partially offset by a decrease in production in canada due to the sale of substantially all of our canadian properties in april 2009 

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the decreased brokered natural gas margin of 55 million is a result of a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase price partially offset by an increase in volumes brokered 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

   

 49  

operating and other expenses 

 

 total costs and expenses from operations decreased by 331 million in 2009 from 2008 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 interest expense net 

interest expense net increased by 226 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the 492 million principal amount of debt we issued in our july and december 2008 private 

  

 50  

placements weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately 166 million during 2009 compared to approximately 172 million during 2008 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 40 during 2009 compared to approximately 48 during 2008 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased by 494 million due to a decrease in our pretax income the effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 336 and 370 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable 

the capital markets continue to be volatile with periods of easy access and times with unfavorable conditions as a result of the volatility in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings we may at times experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances based on recent financings at this time we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by market events 

derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks as of december 31 2010 we had 11 derivative contracts open four natural gas price swap arrangements six natural gas basis swaps arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement during 2010 we entered into a total of six new derivative contracts including one crude oil swap contract for 2010 four natural gas swap contracts for 2011 and one crude oil collar contract for 2011 

  

 51  

as of december 31 2010 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 

 

 the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain  loss column in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2010 and include the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

during 2010 natural gas price swaps covered 359 bcf or 29 of our 2010 gas production at an average price of 930 per mcf we had two crude oil price swaps covering 730 mbbl or 90 of our 2010 oil production at an average price of 10425 per bbl 

during 2010 we also entered into crude oil swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2010 production natural gas swaps to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production and crude oil price collars to hedge our price exposure on our 2011 production in addition we also have natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting 

we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of montreal jpmorgan bank of america and bnp paribas 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair market value of financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments 

  

 52  

the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to the us 

we use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair values of longterm debt are as follows

 item 1 business tableend overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties located in north america in 2009 we restructured our operations by combining our rocky mountain and appalachian areas to form the north region and combining the anadarko basin with our texas and louisiana areas to form the south region certain prior period amounts and historical descriptions have been reclassified to reflect this reorganization operationally we now have two primary regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania 

in 2009 energy commodity prices recovered from the price levels experienced during the second half of 2008 our 2009 average realized natural gas price was 747 per mcf 11 lower than the 2008 average realized price of 839 per mcf our 2009 average realized crude oil price was 8552 per bbl 4 lower than the 2008 average realized price of 8911 per bbl these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives zerocost collars or swaps for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to the “results of operations” section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

in 2009 our investment program totaled 6404 million including lease acquisition 1457 million and drilling and facilities 4011 million programs our capital spending was funded largely through cash flow from operations and to a lesser extent borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

we remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity including cash resources and available credit we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

in april 2009 we sold substantially all of our canadian properties to a private canadian company see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details in april 2009 we also entered into a new revolving credit facility and terminated our prior credit facility see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

in august 2008 we completed the acquisition of producing properties leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east texas the “east texas acquisition” we paid total net cash consideration of approximately 6040 million see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details in order to finance the east texas acquisition we completed a public offering of 5002500 shares of our common stock in june 2008 receiving net proceeds of 3135 million see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details and we closed a private placement in july 2008 of 425 million principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

on an equivalent basis our production level in 2009 increased by 8 from 2008 we produced 1030 bcfe or 2821 mmcfe per day in 2009 as compared to 952 bcfe or 2601 mmcfe per day in 2008 natural gas production increased to 979 bcf in 2009 from 904 bcf in 2008 primarily due to increased production in the north region associated with the increased drilling program in susquehanna county pennsylvania as well as increased natural gas production in the south region associated with the properties we acquired in the east texas acquisition in august 2008 and drilling in the angie field in east texas partially offsetting these production gains were decreases in production in canada due to the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 as well as reduced drilling activity in oklahoma and wyoming oil production increased by 36 mbbls from 782 mbbls in 

  

index to financial statements 2008 to 818 mbbls in 2009 due primarily to increased production in the south region associated with the properties we acquired in the east texas acquisition in august 2008 and an increase related to pettet development in the angie field partially offset by a decrease in production in canada due to the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we drilled 143 gross wells 119 net with a success rate of 95 compared to 432 gross wells 355 net with a success rate of 97 for the prior year in 2010 we plan to drill approximately 136 gross wells 1239 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and to a lesser extent in east texas 

our 2009 total capital and exploration spending was 6404 million compared to 15 billion of total capital and exploration spending in 2008 in both 2009 and 2008 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2010 funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and increased borrowings under our credit facility if required for 2010 the north region is expected to receive approximately 69 of the anticipated capital program with the remaining 31 dedicated to the south region in 2010 we plan to spend approximately 585 million on capital and exploration activities 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 2060 bcfe at december 31 2009 of which 98 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 6 from 1942 bcfe at december 31 2008 on the strength of results from our drilling program in 2009 we had a net downward revision of 2001 bcfe primarily due to i downward revisions of 1016 bcfe due to lower 2009 oil and natural gas prices compared to 2008 and ii downward revisions of 1204 bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the securities and exchange commission’s sec new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology partially offset by 219 bcfe of positive performance revisions 

the following table presents certain reserve production and well information as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to ten years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established we own leasehold rights on approximately 29 million gross acres in addition we own fee interest in approximately 02 million gross acres primarily in west virginia our two largest fields brachfield southeast in east texas and dimock in susquehanna county pennsylvania each contain more than 15 of our proved reserves in addition we are focusing significant 

  

index to financial statements drilling and production activity in the angie field area of east texas these three fields combined make up approximately 43 of our proved reserves 

the following table presents certain information with respect to our principal properties as of and for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

 north region 

the north region is comprised of the appalachian and rocky mountains areas in april 2009 we sold substantially all of our canadian properties to a private canadian company our activities in the appalachian area are concentrated primarily in northeast pennsylvania and in west virginia our activities in the rocky mountains area are concentrated in the green river and washakie basins in wyoming and the paradox basin in colorado this region is managed from our office in pittsburgh pennsylvania in this region our assets include a large acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity 

capital and exploration expenditures for 2009 were 3803 million or 60 of our total 2009 capital and exploration expenditures compared to 4837 million for 2008 or 32 of our total 2008 capital and exploration expenditures this decrease in spending was substantially driven by a 695 million decrease in drilling and facilities costs yearoveryear and the sale of our canadian properties in april 2009 for 2010 we have budgeted approximately 402 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

at december 31 2009 we had 4141 wells 35369 net of which 3681 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals in the appalachian area that include the big lime weir berea and devonian including marcellus shale formations at depths primarily ranging from 950 to 9080 feet with an average depth of approximately 3950 feet in the rocky mountains area principal producing intervals are in the almond frontier dakota and honaker trail formations at depths ranging from 4200 to 14375 feet with an average depth of approximately 10950 feet average net daily production in 2009 for the north region was 1366 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2009 was 492 bcf and 125 mbbls respectively 

while natural gas production volumes from north region reservoirs are on balance lower on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states the productive life of north region reserves is relatively long at december 31 2009 we had 13461 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the north region constituting 65 of our total proved reserves developed and undeveloped reserves made up 8500 bcfe and 4961 bcfe of the total proved reserves for the north region respectively 

in 2009 we drilled 62 wells 594 net in the north region of which 61 wells 593 net were development and extension wells in 2010 we plan to drill approximately 100 wells 100 net primarily in the dimock field in northern pennsylvania 

in 2009 we produced and marketed approximately 321 barrels of crude oilcondensatengl per day in the north region at market responsive prices 

  

index to financial statements ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operated a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3165 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2009 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the north region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

the principal markets for our north region natural gas are in the northeastern and northwestern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system approximately 61 of our natural gas sales volume in the north region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one to three years in addition spot market sales are made at indexbased prices under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately one percent of north region production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually 

south region 

our development exploitation exploration and production activities in the south region are primarily concentrated in east and south texas oklahoma and north louisiana a regional office in houston manages the operations principal producing intervals are in the cotton valley haynesville pettit and james lime formations in north louisiana and east texas the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas and the chase morrow and chester formations in the anadarko basin in oklahoma at depths ranging from 1300 to 16970 feet with an average depth of approximately 8750 feet 

capital and exploration expenditures were 2376 million for 2009 or 37 of our total 2009 capital and exploration expenditures compared to 10223 million for 2008 or 68 of our total 2008 capital and exploration expenditures this decrease in capital spending is primarily due to 6040 million paid in 2008 for the east texas acquisition and a decrease of 1769 million in total drilling of the total company yearoveryear decrease in capital and exploration expenditures approximately 93 was attributable to the decrease in the south region spending for 2010 we have budgeted approximately 181 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region our 2010 south region drilling program will emphasize activity primarily in east texas 

we had 1753 wells 12302 net in the south region as of december 31 2009 of which 1342 wells are operated by us average daily production in 2009 was 1455 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2009 was 488 bcf and 720 mbbls respectively 

  

index to financial statements at december 31 2009 we had 7138 bcfe of proved reserves 95 natural gas in the south region which represented 35 of our total proved reserves developed and undeveloped reserves made up 4747 bcfe and 2391 bcfe of the total proved reserves for the south region respectively 

in 2009 we drilled 81 wells 592 net in the south region of which 75 wells 553 net were development and extension wells in 2010 we plan to drill 36 wells 24 net primarily in east texas including the minden and angie fields 

our principal markets for the south region natural gas are in the industrialized gulf coast area and the midwestern united states we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies currently approximately 89 of our natural gas sales volumes in the south region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one year or greater the remaining 11 of our sales volumes are sold at indexbased prices under shortterm agreements the south region properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

in 2009 we produced and marketed approximately 1966 barrels of crude oilcondensatengl per day in the south region at market responsive prices 

risk management 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2009 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar and swap agreements for portions of our 2009 through 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively in addition we entered into natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting in 2008 and 2007 we employed price collars and swaps to hedge our price exposure on our production the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place 

for 2009 collars covered 48 of natural gas production and had a weightedaverage floor of 940 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1239 per mcf for 2009 swaps covered 16 of natural gas production and 45 of crude oil production and had a weightedaverage price of 1218 per mcf and 12525 per bbl respectively 

as of december 31 2009 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 

 

 our decision to hedge 2010 and 2012 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows us to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production 

  

index to financial statements we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives

proved undeveloped reserves 

at december 31 2009 we had 7352 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves during 2009 we converted 707 bcfe of reserves from proved undeveloped to proved developed an additional 96 bcfe of reserves associated with seven wells drilled in 2009 remain proved undeveloped as a result of the additional capital required to complete the wells during 2009 total capital related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves was 1026 million we had a downward revision of total proved reserves of 2001 bcfe primarily due to i downward revisions of 1016 bcfe due to lower 2009 oil and natural gas prices compared to 2008 and ii downward revisions of 1204 bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the sec’s new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology partially offset by 219 bcfe of positive performance revisions in accordance with the new rules we priced proved oil and gas reserves using the 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month within the 12month period prior to the end of the reporting period 

as of december 31 2009 we have 159 bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves representing less than 1 of our total proved reserves that will require more than five years to develop due to coal mining operations or delays associated with an environment impact statement required to drill on federal land in wyoming an environmental impact study on federal land represents 19 bcfe and the following table summarizes the reserves impacted by mining operations in west virginia

 competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that in the north region our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming year and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources 

other business matters 

major customer 

in 2009 two customers accounted for approximately 13 and 11 respectively of the company’s total sales in 2008 one customer accounted for approximately 16 of the company’s total sales in 2007 no customer accounted for more than 10 of the company’s total sales 

  

index to financial statements seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc and new regulations that require certain noninterstate pipelines to post daily scheduled volume information and design capacity for certain points on their systems the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc’s regulations 

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees 

  

index to financial statements function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines we have completed 100 of the required initial inspection baseline assessment of our pipeline systems in west virginia in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections in july 2009 dot issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to update its reporting requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines on december 3 2009 dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2012 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and 

  

index to financial statements the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in march 2006 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 13 percent should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2006 another ferc matter that may impact our transportation costs relates to a recent policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or potential income tax liability” to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income we currently do not transport any of our oil or natural gas liquids on a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the ferc’s policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

  

index to financial statements superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore many of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however bills have recently been introduced in congress that would subject hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the safe drinking water act if adopted these bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive moreover the bills introduced in congress would require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids many of which are proprietary to the service companies that perform the hydraulic fracturing operations such disclosure could make it easier for third parties to initiate litigation against us in the event of perceived problems with drinking water wells in the vicinity of an oil or gas well or other alleged environmental problems in addition to these federal legislative proposals some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations including but not limited to requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in high 

  

index to financial statements volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations if these types of conditions are adopted we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells 

greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere the us congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 for example the 110th session of congress considered various bills that proposed a “cap and trade” scheme of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that generally would ban emissions above a defined reducing annual cap covered parties would be authorized to emit greenhouse emissions through the acquisition and subsequent surrender of emission allowances that may be traded or acquired on the open market in addition at least 17 states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs require either major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries or gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved 

depending on the particular program we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations or from combustion of oil or natural gas we produce although we would not be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated producers of oil and gas a stringent greenhouse gas control program could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce 

also in the wake of the us supreme court’s decision in april 2007 in massachusetts v environmental protection agency the epa has begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions even though congress has yet to adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases in late 2009 the epa issued a “mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases” final rule which establishes a new comprehensive regulation and reporting scheme for operators of stationary sources emitting certain levels of greenhouse gases and a final rule finding that certain current and projected levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations please read “item 1a risk factors—climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for oil and gas”

 item 1a risk factors tableend natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile natural gas prices have declined from approximately 13 per mmbtu in mid 2008 to an average price of 399 per mmbtu in 2009 oil prices have declined from record levels in mid 2008 of approximately 145 per barrel to an average price of 62 per barrel in 2009 the forward price for both natural gas and oil currently stands at rates higher than those realized in 2009 depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be 

  

index to financial statements encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base 

  

index to financial statements the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board fasb in accounting standards codification 932 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed producing reserves as of december 31 2009 will increase at an estimated rate of 4 during 2010 and then decline at estimated rates of 20 12 and 11 during 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective often we acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties if an acquired property is not performing as originally estimated we may have an impairment which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert management’s attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert management’s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 

  

   

index to financial statements the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas largely coastal waters which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2009 we owned or operated approximately 3500 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 

bills have recently been introduced in congress that would subject hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the safe drinking water act if adopted these bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive moreover the bills introduced in congress would require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids many of which are proprietary to the service companies that perform the hydraulic fracturing operations such disclosure could make it easier for third parties to initiate litigation against us in the event of perceived problems with drinking water wells in the vicinity of an oil or gas well or other alleged environmental problems in addition to these federal legislative proposals some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing operations including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations if these types of conditions are adopted we could be subject to increased costs and possibly limits on the productivity of certain wells 

  

index to financial statements we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 15 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 5 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2009 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operator’s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator’s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many 

  

index to financial statements different types of derivatives available in 2009 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar and swap agreements for portions of our 2009 through 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively in addition we entered into natural gas basis swaps covering a portion of anticipated 2012 production which do not qualify for hedge accounting the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 

  

  

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and gas that we produce 

there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases on september 22 2009 the epa issued a “mandatory reporting of greenhouse 

  

index to financial statements gases” final rule “reporting rule” the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epa’s endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however the epa must now finalize motor vehicle greenhouse gases standards the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil finally according to the epa the final motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources moreover in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it international discussions are currently underway to develop a treaty to replace the kyoto protocol after its expiration in 2012 while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas 

the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year 2011 includes certain provisions that if passed as originally submitted will have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

on february 1 2010 the office of management and budget released a summary of the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year 2011 the proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes the provisions include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred increases in the taxation of foreign source income levy of an excise tax on gulf of mexico oil and gas production repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these provisions become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter 

  

index to financial statements the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors’ duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 

  

  

  

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

commitment and contingency reserves 

when deemed necessary we establish reserves for certain legal proceedings the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately 09 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in presenting the geographic areas in which we conduct our operations these areas consist of the north comprised of the east and rocky mountain areas and south comprised of the gulf coast and anadarko areas in previous periods we presented the geographic areas as east gulf coast west and canada 

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

  

index to financial statements we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively within the united states in april 2009 we sold substantially all of our canadian properties to a private canadian company 

overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in the continental us we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

at cabot we evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time at any one time one or more of these may not be economically feasible 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2009 commodity index prices in general traded in a range significantly below recent highs however our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 747 per mcf and 8552 per bbl respectively in 2009 and were significantly increased by our positions from our derivative instruments which contributed approximately 45 of our realized revenues in 2009 in an effort to manage commodity price risk we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see “risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business” and “risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable” in item 1a 

the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2008 and 2009 “index” represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2008” and “2009” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements as applicable 

 

   

index to financial statements prices for crude oil rose to record high levels in 2008 but experienced significant declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 prices improved during 2009 the tables below contain the nymex monthly average crude oil price index and our realized per barrel bbl crude oil prices by month for 2008 and 2009 the “2008” and “2009” price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements 

 

 we reported earnings of 143 per share or 1483 million for 2009 a decrease from the 210 per share or 2113 million reported in 2008 natural gas revenues decreased from 2008 to 2009 as a result of decreased commodity market prices partially offset by increased natural gas production and favorable natural gas hedge settlements crude oil revenues remained flat from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to increased crude oil production and favorable oil hedge settlements offset by a decrease in realized prices prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments decreased by 11 for natural gas and 4 for oil 

we drilled 143 gross wells with a success rate of 95 in 2009 compared to 432 gross wells with a success rate of 97 in 2008 total capital and exploration expenditures decreased by 8406 million to 6404 million in 2009 compared to 14810 million including the east texas acquisition in 2008 this decrease was largely due to the 604 million acquisition of east texas assets in 2008 and a decrease of 2319 million in total drilling we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2010 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately 585 million any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 

our 2010 strategy will remain consistent with 2009 we will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity including cash resources and available credit in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and to a lesser extent east texas we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2009 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations and to a lesser extent the sales of properties during the year and borrowings under our revolving credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our development and exploratory expenditures in addition to payments for debt service debt issuance costs contributions to our pension plan and dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

  

index to financial statements we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years commodity prices have recently experienced increased volatility due to adverse market conditions in our economy in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see “results of operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate credit availability and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 

 

 operating activities key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased by 204 million over 2008 this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues partially offset by lower operating interest and tax expense average realized natural gas prices decreased by 11 in 2009 compared to 2008 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 4 over the same period equivalent production volumes increased by 8 in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may continue to decline during 2010 

for 2009 we had natural gas price swaps covering 161 bcf of our 2009 gas production at an average price of 1218 per mcf and natural gas price collars covering 473 bcf of our 2009 gas production with a weightedaverage floor of 940 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1239 per mcf as of december 31 2009 we have natural gas price swaps covering 193 bcf of our 2010 gas production at an average price of 930 per mcf and no natural gas price collars accordingly based on our current hedge position we will be more subject to the effects of natural gas price volatility in 2010 than in 2009 in addition given the current market for derivatives if we were to hedge all our 2010 production we would expect our realized prices to be lower than our 2009 realized prices 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased by 1723 million over 2007 this increase was mainly due to an increase in net income the receipt of cash of 202 million in 2008 in connection with the settlement of a dispute and an increase of 137 million in cash received for income tax refunds in addition cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of other working capital changes average realized natural gas prices increased by 16 in 2008 over 2007 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 33 over the same period equivalent production volumes increased by 11 in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of higher natural gas production 

see “results of operations” for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 

  

index to financial statements and cash flows due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 9213 million from 2008 to 2009 and increased by 8624 million from 2007 to 2008 the decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due to a decrease of 8628 million in acquisitions and capital expenditures and an increase of 781 million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of 196 million in exploration expenditures in august 2008 we completed the acquisition of producing properties leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east texas for total net cash consideration of approximately 6040 million 

the increase from 2007 to 2008 was due to an increase of 8660 million in capital expenditures including an increase of approximately 6018 million primarily due to the 6040 million east texas acquisition and an increase of 1305 million related to unproved leasehold acquisitions primarily in northeast pennsylvania in addition there were 50 million of lower proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offsetting these increases to cash used in investing activities were decreased exploration expenditures of 86 million in 2008 compared to 2007 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 8984 million from 2008 to 2009 this was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings from debt of 787 million partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of 208 million and a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock of 3161 million primarily due to our june 2008 issuance of 5002500 shares of common stock in a public offering common stock proceeds and debt borrowings in 2008 were largely used to finance the acquisition of east texas properties and undeveloped acreage cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs and dividends increased by a total of 64 million partially offset by an increase of 31 million in the tax benefit associated with stockbased compensation 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 7230 million from 2007 to 2008 this was primarily due to an increase in debt consisting of our july 2008 and december 2008 private placements of debt 492 million and an increase of 45 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility additionally net proceeds from the sale of common stock increased by 3111 million primarily due to the june 2008 issuance of common stock the tax benefit for stockbased compensation increased by 107 million from 2007 to 2008 but was partially offset by an increase in dividends and capitalized debt issuance costs paid 

at december 31 2009 we had 143 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 39 in april 2009 we entered into a new revolving credit facility and terminated our prior credit facility the new credit facility provides for an available credit line of 500 million and contains an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to 600 million if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash existing cash and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position at the same time we will closely monitor the capital markets 

in july 2008 we completed a private placement of 425 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixedrate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 651 consisting of amounts due in july 2018 2020 and 2023 in december 2008 we completed a private placement of 67 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 978 fixedrate notes due in december 2018 please refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

in june 2008 we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5002500 shares of common stock at a price to us of 6266 per share we received 3135 million in net 

  

index to financial statements proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions these net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east texas acquisition which closed in the third quarter of 2008 immediately prior to and in connection with this issuance we retired 5002500 shares of treasury stock which had a weightedaverage purchase price of 1646 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

  

 for the year ended december 31 2009 we paid dividends of 124 million 003 per share on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2009 

 

  

 we plan to drill approximately 136 gross wells 1239 net in 2010 compared with 143 gross wells 1185 net drilled in 2009 the number of net wells we plan to drill in 2010 is up slightly from 2009 this 2010 drilling 

  

index to financial statements program includes approximately 585 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 6404 million in 2009 this decline is primarily due to lower projected lease acquisition expenditures we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization dda rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods in 2010 management expects an increase in our dda rate due to higher capital costs partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years and increased lease acquisition costs in pennsylvania this change is currently estimated to be approximately 11 greater than 2009 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

contractual obligations 

our material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 are set forth in the following table 

 

  

   amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2009 was 297 million up from 280 million at december 31 2008 primarily due to 13 million of accretion expense during 2009 as well as 04 million of drilling additions 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the most significant policies are discussed below 

  

index to financial statements oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

since 1990 100 of our reserves have been reviewed by miller  lents ltd an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate in 2009 we had a net downward revision of 2001 bcfe primarily due to i downward revisions of 1016 bcfe due to lower 2009 oil and natural gas prices compared to 2008 and ii downward revisions of 1204 bcfe due to the removal of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled for development beyond five years primarily due to the application of the sec’s new oil and gas reserve calculation methodology partially offset by 219 bcfe of positive performance revisions in accordance with the new rules we priced proved oil and gas reserves using the 12month average oil and gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month within the 12month period prior to the end of the reporting period we did not record significant reserve revisions during 2008 and 2007 for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the “supplemental oil and gas information” 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves which is utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 007 to 009 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 002 to 004 per mcfe impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under accounting standards codification asc 360 “property plant and equipment” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used 16 at december 31 2009 is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil in 2009 2008 and 2007 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

  

index to financial statements costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed during the latter part of 2008 and during 2009 commodity prices declined at a significant rate as the global economy struggled with a worldwide recession this price environment has resulted in reduced capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts discussed above when assessing the impairment of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 193 million or decrease by approximately 138 million respectively per year 

in the past based on the customary terms of the leases the average leasehold life in the south region has been shorter than the average life in the north region average property lives in the north and south regions have been five and three years respectively as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we follow the accounting prescribed in asc 815 under asc 815 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective under asc 815 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations 

fair value measurements 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted those provisions of asc 820 “fair value measurements and disclosures” that were required to be adopted which excluded certain non financial assets and liabilities effective january 1 2009 we applied all of the provisions of asc 820 and this adoption did not have a material impact on any of our financial statements except for our impairment of oil and gas properties see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the future areas that could cause an impact would primarily be limited to asset impairments including longlived assets asset retirement obligations and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination if any as defined in asc 820 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 

we utilize market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable we attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs we are able to classify fair value balances based 

  

index to financial statements on the observability of those inputs asc 820 establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements and accordingly level 1 measurements should be used whenever possible 

as of december 31 2009 we had 1147 million of financial assets or 3 of our total assets classified as level 3 this was entirely comprised of our derivative receivable balance from our oil and gas cash flow hedges during 2009 realized gains of 2409 million were recognized in other comprehensive income derivative settlements during the year totaled 3950 million the fair values of our natural gas and crude oil price collars and swaps are valued based upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements and are designated as level 3 such quotes have been derived using a blackscholes model for the active oil and gas commodities market that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term these estimates are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness we adjust the fair value quotes received by our counterparties to take into account either the counterparties’ nonperformance risk or our own nonperformance risk we measured the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions the resulting reduction to the net receivable derivative contract position was 02 million in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank additional disclosures are required for transactions measured at fair value and we have included these disclosures in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

longterm employee benefit costs 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of highquality fixed income securities in order to select the discount rate we use benchmarks such as the moody’s aa corporate rate which was 549 as of december 31 2009 and the citigroup pension liability index which was 596 as of december 31 2009 we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 575 at december 31 2009 is reasonable 

in order to value our pension liabilities we use the irs 2009 static mortality table based on the demographics of our benefit plans we have also assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2009 the assumed rate of increase was 10 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the longterm to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

  

index to financial statements we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan we attempt to maximize return over the longterm subject to appropriate levels of risk one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors’ 500 index over the longterm we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the longterm we establish the longterm expected rate of return by developing a forwardlooking longterm expected rate of return assumption for each asset class taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation in our pension calculations we have used eight percent as the expected longterm return on plan assets for 2009 2008 and 2007 a monte carlo simulation was run using 5000 simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration which has been determined to be approximately 15 years this model uses historical data for the period of 19262007 for stocks bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns the median rate of return or return that we expect to achieve over 50 percent of the time is approximately nine percent we expect to achieve at a minimum approximately seven percent annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the longterm at least 75 percent of the time we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 

we generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately 50 to 80 for equity securities and approximately 20 to 40 for fixed income securities large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65 of the portfolio small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30 and 15 respectively of the portfolio fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40 of our portfolio the account will typically be fully invested however as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure part of the account may be invested in money market investments up to 20 one percent of the portfolio is invested in shortterm funds at the designated bank to meet the cash flow needs of the plan no prohibited investments including direct or indirect investments in commodities commodity futures derivatives short sales real estate investment trusts letter stock restricted stock or other private placements are allowed without prior committee approval 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under asc 718 for stock options and similar equity instruments under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

stock options and stock appreciation rights sars are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date the grant date fair value is calculated by using a blackscholes model that incorporates assumptions for stock price volatility risk free rate of return expected dividend and expected term the expected term was derived by reviewing minimum and maximum expected term outputs from the blackscholes model based on award type and employee type this term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding the stock price volatility was calculated using our historical closing stock price data for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award the risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the us treasury nominal 10 within the expected term as measured on the grant date the expected dividend percentage assumes that we will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter expense is recorded based on a gradedvesting schedule over a three year service period with onethird of the award becoming exercisable each year on the anniversary date of the grant the forfeiture rate is determined based on the forfeiture history by type of award and by the group of individuals receiving the award 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock units and certain performance share awards which contain vesting restrictions based either on operating income or internal performance metrics are measured 

  

index to financial statements based on the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date restricted stock awards primarily vest either at the end of a three year service period or on a gradedvesting basis of onethird at each anniversary date over a three year service period the annual forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards ranges from 0 to 71 based on approximately ten years of our history for this type of award to various employee groups performance shares that vest based on operating income or operating cash flow metrics vest on a gradedvesting basis of onethird at each anniversary date over a three year service period and no forfeiture rate is assumed performance shares that vest based on internal metrics vest at the end of a three year performance period and an annual forfeiture rate of 52 is assumed expense for restricted stock units is recorded immediately as these awards vest immediately restricted stock units are granted only to our directors and no forfeiture rate is assumed 

we grant another type of performance share award to executive employees that vest at the end of a three year performance period based on the comparative performance of our stock measured against sixteen other companies in our peer group depending on our performance an aggregate of up to 100 of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in common stock plus up to an additional 100 of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in cash these awards are accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components a monte carlo model is used to value the liability component as well as the equity portion of the certain awards on the date of grant the four primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the riskfree rate volatility of returns correlation in movement of total shareholder return and the expected dividend an interpolated riskfree rate was generated from the federal reserve website for constant maturity treasuries for one and two year bonds as of the reporting date set equal to the remaining duration of the performance period volatility was set equal to the annualized daily volatility for the remaining duration of the reporting period ending on the reporting date correlation in movement of total shareholder return was determined based on a correlation matrix that was created which identifies total shareholder return correlations for each pair of companies in the peer group including us the paired returns in the correlation matrix ranged from approximately 52 to approximately 86 for us and our peer group the expected dividend is calculated using our annual dividends paid 012 per share for 2009 divided by the december 31 2009 closing price of our stock 4359 based on these inputs discussed above a ranking was projected identifying our rank relative to the peer group for each award period no forfeiture rate is assumed for this type of award expense related to these awards can be volatile based on our comparative ranking at the end of each quarter 

we used the shortcut approach to derive our initial windfall tax benefit pool we chose to use a onepool approach which combines all awards granted to employees including nonemployee directors 

on january 16 2008 our board of directors adopted a supplemental employee incentive plan the plan was intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for fulltime nonofficer employees by providing for cash payments in the event our common stock reached specified trading prices the bonus payout of a minimum of 50 of an employee’s base salary was triggered if for any 20 trading days which need not be consecutive that fell within a period of 60 consecutive trading days occurring on or before november 1 2011 the closing price per share of our common stock equaled or exceeded the final price goal of 60 per share the plan also provided that an interim distribution of 10 of an employee’s base salary would be paid to eligible employees upon achieving the interim price goal of 50 per share prior to december 31 2009 

on the january 16 2008 adoption date of the plan our closing stock price was 4071 on april 8 2008 and subsequently on june 2 2008 we achieved the interim and final target goals and total distributions of 157 million were paid in 2009 no further distributions will be made under this plan 

on july 24 2008 our board of directors adopted a second supplemental employee incentive plan “plan ii” plan ii is similar to the january 2008 supplemental incentive plan however the final target is that the closing price per share of our common stock must equal or exceed the price goal of 105 per share on or before june 20 2012 under plan ii each eligible employee may receive upon approval by the compensation 

  

index to financial statements committee a distribution of 50 of his or her base salary or 30 of base salary if we paid interim distributions upon the achievement of the interim price goal discussed below plan ii provides that a distribution of 20 of an eligible employee’s base salary upon achieving the interim price goal of 85 per share on or before june 30 2010 the compensation committee can increase the 50 or 20 payment as it applies to any employee payments under this plan will partially be paid within 15 business days after achieving the target and the remaining portion will be paid based on a separate payment date as described in plan ii 

these awards under both plans discussed above have been accounted for as liability awards under asc 718 the total expense for 2009 and 2008 was 12 million and 159 million respectively and is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations for further information regarding the supplemental employee incentive plans and our other stockbased compensation awards please refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production” “natural gas marketing gathering and transportation” “federal regulation of petroleum” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 in addition we are required to maintain an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of 15 to 10 and a current ratio of 10 to 10 our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of 15 to 10 at december 31 2009 we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in “capital resources and liquidity” 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see “risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under asc 360 “property plant and equipment” because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index falls the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price 

  

index to financial statements risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

settlement of dispute in december 2008 we settled a dispute with a third party and as a result recorded a gain of 519 million approximately 325 million aftertax the dispute involved the propriety of possession of our intellectual property by a third party the settlement was comprised of 202 million in cash paid by the third party to us and 317 million related to the fair value of unproved property rights transferred by the third party to us the fair market value of the unproved property rights was determined based on observable market costs and conditions over a recent time period values were prorated by property based on the primary term remaining on the properties 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in july 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc 105 “generally accepted accounting principles” establishing the accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles gaap as the sole source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap the codification was not intended to change us gaap however references to various accounting pronouncements and literature will now differ from what was previously being used in practice authoritative literature is now referenced by topic rather than by type of standard as of july 1 2009 the fasb no longer issues statements interpretations staff positions or eitf abstracts the fasb now communicates new accounting standards by issuing an accounting standards update asu all guidance in the codification has an equal level of authority asc 105 is effective for financial statements that cover interim and annual periods ending after september 15 2009 and supersedes all accounting standards in us gaap aside from those issued by the sec there was no impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of the codification 

in february 2008 the fasb issued an amendment to asc 820 “fair value measurements and disclosures” which granted a one year deferral to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis to comply with asc 820 effective january 1 2009 we applied these amendments of asc 820 discussed above and there was no material impact on our financial statements except for our impairment of oil and gas properties for further information please refer to note 2 and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted amendments that the fasb made to asc 260 “earnings per share” regarding determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities the adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our financial statements for further information please refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in march 2008 the fasb amended the disclosure requirements prescribed in asc 815 “derivatives and hedging” we adopted these amendments as of january 1 2009 the principal impact was to require the expansion of our disclosure regarding our derivative instruments for further information please refer to “derivative instruments and hedging activity” in note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb amended guidance in asc 820 regarding determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly if an entity determines that either the volume or level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased from normal conditions or that price quotations or observable inputs are not associated with orderly transactions increased analysis and management judgment will be required to estimate fair value the objective in fair value measurement remains unchanged from what is prescribed in asc 820 and should be reflective of the current exit price disclosures in interim and annual periods must include inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value along with any changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period in 

  

index to financial statements addition disclosures for debt and equity securities must be provided on a more disaggregated basis these amendments became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 and did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2009 the fasb amended asc 825 “financial instruments” to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for publicly traded companies for both interim and annual periods historically these disclosures were only required annually the interim disclosures are intended to provide financial statement users with more timely and transparent information about the effects of current market conditions on an entity’s financial instruments that are not otherwise reported at fair value these amendments became effective for interim reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 comparative disclosures are only required for periods ending after the initial adoption there was no material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of the adoption for further information please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb amended the otherthantemporary impairment guidance for debt securities in asc 320 “investments—debt and equity securities” to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of otherthantemporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements there were no amendments made to the recognition and measurement guidance for equity securities but a new method of recognizing and reporting for debt securities was established disclosure requirements for impaired debt and equity securities have been expanded significantly and are now required quarterly as well as annually these amendments became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 and did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows comparative disclosures are only required for periods ending after the initial adoption 

in june 2009 the fasb amended asc 855 “subsequent events” to require entities to disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events and whether the date corresponds with the release of their financial statements in addition a new concept of financial statements being “available to be issued” was introduced these amendments became effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 and did not have any impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2009 the fasb issued asu no 200905 “fair value measurement and disclosures measuring liabilities at fair value” which provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available asu no 200905 specifies that in cases where a quoted price in an active market is not available a valuation technique should be applied that uses either the quote of the liability when traded as an asset the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets or another valuation technique consistent with existing fair value measurement guidance valuation methods discussed include using an income approach such as a present value technique or a market approach based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability entities are not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability asu no 200905 is codified in asc 82010 and is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance there was no impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of the adoption of asu no 200905 for further information please refer to note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2008 the sec issued release no 338995 “modernization of oil and gas reporting” which amends the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in regulations sk and sx as well as adding a section to regulation sk subpart 1200 to codify the revised disclosure requirements in securities act industry guide 2 which has been phased out release no 338995 is intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves energy companies affected by release no 338995 are required to price proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the 12month period prior to the end of the reporting period unless

index to financial statements results of operations 

2009 and 2008 compared 

we reported net income for 2009 of 1483 million or 143 per share during 2008 we reported net income of 2113 million or 210 per share net income decreased in 2009 by 630 million primarily due to a decrease in operating revenues an increase in depreciation depletion and amortization an increase in interest expense an increase in exploration expense and an increase in direct operations also impacting net income in 2008 was a gain on the settlement of a dispute these decreases and increases were partially offset by decreased operating and income tax expenses decreased brokered natural gas cost decreased impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets decreased impairments of unproved properties decreased general and administrative expense and loss on sale of assets operating revenues decreased by 665 million largely due to decreases in brokered natural gas and natural gas production revenues operating expenses decreased by 331 million between periods due primarily to decreases in impairments of unproved properties and oil and gas properties brokered natural gas costs taxes other than income and general and administrative expenses partially offset by increased depreciation depletion and amortization exploration expense and direct operations in addition net income was impacted in 2009 by higher interest expense decreased income tax expense and to a lesser extent loss on sale of assets income tax expense was lower in 2009 as a result of a decrease in operating income as discussed above and a decrease in the effective tax rate the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits 

natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 747 per mcf for 2009 compared to 839 per mcf for 2008 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 380 per mcf in 2009 and by 020 per mcf in 2008 the following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in fair value of our basis swaps of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2009 which has been included within natural gas production revenues in the consolidated statement of operations there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

   

index to financial statements  the decrease in natural gas production revenue of 271 million excluding the impact of the unrealized gains and losses discussed above is almost entirely due to the sale of our canadian properties a decrease in realized natural gas prices in all regions was essentially offset by an increase in natural gas production this increase in natural gas production was primarily a result of increased production in the north region associated with the initiation of production in susquehanna county pennsylvania in the third quarter of 2008 and increased drilling in the marcellus shale prospect in susquehanna county as well as increased natural gas production in the south region associated with the properties we acquired in east texas in august 2008 and drilling in the angie field partially offsetting these production gains were decreases in production in canada due to the sale of substantially all of our canadian properties in april 2009 

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

   

index to financial statements the decreased brokered natural gas margin of 55 million is a result of a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase price partially offset by an increase in volumes brokered 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 8552 per bbl for 2009 compared to 8911 per bbl for 2008 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 2825 per bbl in 2009 and decreased the price by 633 per bbl in 2008 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in crude oil and condensate derivative fair value in 2009 or 2008 

 

 the increase in crude oil production partially offset by a decrease in realized crude oil prices in the north and canada resulted in a net revenue increase of 02 million the increase in crude oil production was primarily the result of increased production in the south region associated with the properties we acquired in the east texas acquisition in august 2008 and an increase related to pettet development in the angie field partially offset by a decrease in production in canada due to the sale of substantially all of our canadian properties in april 2009 

  

index to financial statements impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of montreal bnp paribas jpmorgan chase key bank and morgan stanley 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations decreased by 331 million in 2009 from 2008 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

 interest expense net 

interest expense net increased by 226 million from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the 492 million principal amount of debt we issued in our july and december 2008 private placements weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately 166 million during 2009 compared to approximately 172 million during 2008 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to approximately 40 during 2009 compared to approximately 48 during 2008 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased by 494 million due to a decrease in our pretax income the effective tax rates for 2009 and 2008 were 336 and 370 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an overall reduction in state deferred tax liabilities and tax benefits associated with foreign tax credits 

2008 and 2007 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2008 of 2113 million or 210 per share during 2007 we reported net income of 1674 million or 173 per share this increase of 439 million in net income was primarily due to an increase in operating revenues and gains on asset sales and settlements partially offset by increased operating interest and income tax expenses operating revenues increased by 2136 million largely due to increases in both natural gas production revenues and brokered natural gas revenues and crude oil and condensate revenues operating expenses increased by 1559 million between periods due to increases in all categories of operating expenses other than exploration expense in addition net income was impacted by an increase in gain on sale of assets and gain on settlement of dispute of 396 million as well as an increase in expenses of 534 million resulting from a combination of increased income tax expense and interest and other expenses income tax expense was higher in 2008 as a result of higher income before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition to an increase in the effective tax rate 

  

index to financial statements natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 839 per mcf for 2008 compared to 723 per mcf for 2007 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 020 per mcf in 2008 and by 099 per mcf in 2007 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 the increase in natural gas production revenue of 1771 million is due to the increase in realized natural gas sales prices in addition to an increase in natural gas production natural gas production in the south region increased due to increased production in the minden field largely due to the properties we acquired in east texas in august 2008 as well as increased drilling in the county line field in addition natural gas production increased in the north region associated with an increase in the drilling program and increased drilling activity in west virginia and northeastern pennsylvania canada increased due to drilling in the hinton field 

  

index to financial statements brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the increased brokered natural gas margin of 24 million is a result of an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price partially offset by a decrease in the volumes brokered in 2008 over 2007 

crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 8911 per bbl for 2008 compared to 6716 per bbl for 2007 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which decreased the price by 633 per bbl in 2008 and by 097 per bbl in 2007 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in crude oil and condensate derivative fair value in 2008 or 2007 

 

   

index to financial statements  the increase in realized crude oil prices partially offset by a decrease in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 144 million the decrease in oil production is mainly the result of a natural decline in crude oil production in the north and south regions 

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased by 1559 million in 2008 from 2007 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

 interest expense net 

interest expense net increased by 192 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the debt we issued in our july and december 2008 private placements and to a lesser extent higher average credit facility borrowings offset in part by a lower weightedaverage interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings and lower outstanding borrowings on our 719 fixed rate debt weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately 172 million during 2008 compared to approximately 52 million during 2007 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 48 during 2008 from 72 during 2007 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 342 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax income the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 370 and 350 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a one time benefit for state taxes in 2007 of approximately 28 million attributable to favorable treatment of the gain from the sale of south louisiana properties in 2006 and a reduction in special deductions in 2008

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable 

the debt and equity markets have recently experienced unfavorable conditions which may affect our ability to access those markets as a result of the volatility and disruption in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings we may experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances at this time we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent market events we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our lenders in our revolving credit facility 

  

index to financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks at december 31 2009 we had 12 cash flow hedges open 11 natural gas price swap arrangements and one crude oil price swap arrangement during 2009 we entered into six new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas production for 2012 these natural gas basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting under asc 815 these natural gas basis swaps mitigate the risk associated with basis differentials that may expand or increase over time thus reducing the exposure and risk of basis fluctuations 

as of december 31 2009 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives 

 

 the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain column in the tables above represent our total unrealized gain position at december 31 2009 and do not include the impact of nonperformance risk also impacting the total unrealized net gain reflecting the net receivable position in accumulated other comprehensive income  loss in the consolidated balance sheet is a reduction of 02 million related to our assessment of our counterparties’ nonperformance risk this risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

during 2009 four natural gas price swaps covered 16079 mmcf or 16 of our 2009 gas production at an average price of 1218 per mcf 

we had one crude oil price swap covering 365 mbbl or 45 of our 2009 oil production at a price of 12525 per bbl 

  

index to financial statements from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us during 2009 14 natural gas price collars covered 47253 mmcf or 48 of our 2009 gas production with a weightedaverage floor of 940 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1239 per mcf 

we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair market value of financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the year end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes to new issues secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair values of all of the fixedrate notes excluding the credit facility are based on interest rates currently available to us the credit facility approximates fair value because this instrument bears interest at rates based on current market rates 

we use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt

 item 1 business tableend overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties located in north america our four principal areas of operation are the appalachian basin onshore gulf coast including south and east texas and north louisiana the rocky mountains and the anadarko basin we also operate in the deep gas basin of western canada operationally we have four regional offices located in houston texas charleston west virginia denver colorado and calgary alberta 

in 2008 energy commodity prices increased to alltime high levels for the first half of the year and then quickly declined to 2007 levels during the second half of 2008 our 2008 average realized natural gas price was 839 per mcf 16 higher than the 2007 average realized price of 723 per mcf our 2008 average realized crude oil price was 8911 per bbl 33 higher than the 2007 average realized price of 6716 per bbl these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives zerocost collars or swaps for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to the “results of operations” section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

in 2008 we pursued and completed the largest investment program in our history totaling 14810 million this included our largest producing property acquisition 6250 million lease acquisition 1527 million and drilling and facilities 6243 million programs the producing property and lease acquisition activity were funded by issuances of new longterm debt and common stock during the year the capital spending excluding the acquisition activity was funded largely through cash flow from operations and to a lesser extent borrowings on our revolving credit facility 

we intend to manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity and we intend to maintain spending discipline we believe these strategies continue to be appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and we believe our balance sheet and availability under our credit facility provide sufficient liquidity to pursue our 2009 program 

in august 2008 we completed the acquisition of producing properties leasehold acreage and a natural gas gathering infrastructure in east texas the “east texas acquisition” we paid total net cash consideration of approximately 6040 million see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details in order to finance the east texas acquisition we completed a public offering of 5002500 shares of our common stock in june 2008 receiving net proceeds of 3135 million see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details and we closed a private placement in july 2008 of 425 million principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

on an equivalent basis our production level in 2008 increased by 11 from 2007 we produced 952 bcfe or 2601 mmcfe per day in 2008 as compared to 855 bcfe or 2341 mmcfe per day in 2007 natural gas production increased to 904 bcf in 2008 from 805 bcf in 2007 primarily due to 1 increased natural gas production in the gulf coast region due to increased production in the minden field largely due to the properties we acquired in the east texas acquisition in august 2008 and increased drilling in the county line field 2 increased production in the west region associated with an increase in the drilling program 3 increased production in the east region due to increased drilling activity in west virginia and northeastern pennsylvania and 4 increased production in canada due to increased drilling activity in the hinton field oil production decreased by 41 mbbls from 823 mbbls in 2007 to 782 mbbls in 2008 due primarily to natural declines in the gulf coast and west regions 

  

index to financial statements for the year ended december 31 2008 we drilled 432 gross wells 355 net with a success rate of 97 compared to 461 gross wells 391 net with a success rate of 96 for the prior year in 2009 we plan to drill approximately 148 gross wells 1223 net the number of wells we plan to drill in 2009 is down from 2008 primarily due to lower commodity prices resulting from the global decline in economic activity as well as our ongoing strategy of managing our capital investment program within anticipated cash flow we plan to concentrate our capital program for 2009 in east texas and northeast pennsylvania where opportunities for growth are currently concentrated 

our 2008 capital and exploration spending was 15 billion compared to 6362 million of total capital and exploration spending in 2007 in both 2008 and 2007 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2009 funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and increased borrowings under our credit facility if required we may also reduce our budgeted capital and exploration spending to maintain sufficient liquidity we remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position for 2009 the gulf coast and east regions are expected to receive approximately 90 of the anticipated capital program with the majority of the remainder dedicated to the west region we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm in 2009 we plan to spend approximately 475 million on capital and exploration activities 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 1942 bcfe at december 31 2008 of which 97 were natural gas this reserve level was up by 20 from 1616 bcfe at december 31 2007 on the strength of results from our drilling program the increase in our capital spending and the east texas acquisition 

the following table presents certain reserve production and well information as of december 31 2008 

 

  

  our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to ten years these properties are held for longer periods if production is established we own leasehold rights on approximately 30 million gross acres in addition we own fee interest in approximately 02 million gross acres primarily in west virginia our ten largest fields which are fields with 25 or greater of total company proved reserves make up approximately 53 of total company proved reserves 

  

index to financial statements the following table presents certain information with respect to our principal properties as of and for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

 east region 

our east region activities are concentrated primarily in west virginia and pennsylvania this region is managed from our office in charleston west virginia in this region our assets include a large acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity 

capital and exploration expenditures for 2008 were 3696 million or 24 of our total 2008 capital and exploration expenditures compared to 1786 million for 2007 or 28 of our total 2007 capital and exploration expenditures this increase was substantially driven by a 1031 million increase in lease acquisition costs yearoveryear for 2009 we have budgeted approximately 200 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

at december 31 2008 we had 3382 wells 31626 net of which 3268 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include the big lime weir berea and devonian including marcellus shale formations at depths primarily ranging from 1100 to 9500 feet with an average depth of approximately 4100 feet average net daily production in 2008 was 691 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2008 was 252 bcf and 23 mbbls respectively 

while natural gas production volumes from east reservoirs are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states the productive life of east region reserves is relatively long at december 31 2008 we had 8718 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the east region constituting 45 of our total proved reserves developed and undeveloped reserves made up 6134 bcfe and 2584 bcfe of the total proved reserves for the east region respectively while no properties are individually significant to our company as a whole the sissonville pineville loganholdendingess big creek hernshawbullcreek and huff creek fields in west virginia and the dimock field in the susquehanna area of pennsylvania are included in our ten largest fields and together contain approximately 30 of our total company proved equivalent reserves 

  

index to financial statements in 2008 we drilled 212 wells 2054 net in the east region of which 208 wells 2014 net were development and extension wells in 2009 we plan to drill approximately 63 wells 628 net primarily in the dimock field 

in 2008 we produced and marketed approximately 62 barrels of crude oilcondensatengl per day in the east region at market responsive prices 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operated a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3200 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2008 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the east region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

the principal markets for our east region natural gas are in the northeast united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system 

approximately 70 of our natural gas sales volume in the east region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one year or greater in addition spot market sales are made at indexbased prices under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately one percent of east production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually

in 2008 we produced and marketed approximately 59 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the canada region at market responsive prices 

risk management 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2008 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar and swap agreements for portions of our 2008 through 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively in 2007 and 2006 we primarily employed price collars to hedge our price exposure on our production the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place 

for 2008 collars covered 60 of natural gas production and had a weightedaverage floor of 853 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1070 per mcf at december 31 2008 natural gas price collars for the year ending december 31 2009 will cover 47253 mmcf of production at a weightedaverage floor of 940 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1239 per mcf for 2008 collars covered 47 of crude oil production and had a floor of 6000 per bbl and a ceiling of 8000 per bbl 

for 2008 swaps covered 11 of natural gas production and had a weightedaverage price of 1027 per mcf at december 31 2008 natural gas price swaps for the years ending december 31 2009 and 2010 will cover 16079 mmcf and 19295 mmcf of production respectively at a weightedaverage price of 1218 per mcf and 1143 per mcf respectively for 2008 a swap covered 12 of crude oil production and had a fixed price of 12715 per bbl crude oil price swaps for the years ending december 31 2009 and 2010 will cover 365 mbbls each at a fixed price of 12525 per bbl and 12500 per bbl respectively our decision to hedge 2009 and 2010 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows us to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production during january 2009 we entered into basis swaps in the gulf coast region that will cover 16079 mmcf of anticipated 2012 natural gas production at fixed basis differentials per mcf of 026 to 027 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives

index to financial statements competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that in the east region our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming year and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources 

other business matters 

major customer 

in 2008 one customer accounted for approximately 16 of our total sales in 2007 and 2006 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market 

  

index to financial statements manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc and new regulations that require certain noninterstate pipelines to post daily scheduled volume information and design capacity for certain points on their systems the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the ferc’s regulations 

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines we have completed 100 of the required initial inspection baseline assessment of our pipeline systems in west virginia in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections in september 2008 as mandated by this statute dot issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish new rules that would require pipeline operators to amend their existing written operations and maintenance procedures operator qualification programs and emergency plans to assure pipeline safety and integrity we are not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of these rules on our facilities or our business 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what 

  

index to financial statements proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in march 2006 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 13 percent should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2006 another ferc matter that may impact our transportation costs relates to a recent policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or potential income tax liability” to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the ferc’s policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or 

  

index to financial statements other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released 

oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile natural gas price have declined from approximately 13 per mmbtu in july 2008 to approximately 450 per mmbtu as of february 1 2009 oil prices have declined from record levels in july 2008 of approximately 145 per barrel to approximately 40 per barrel as of february 1 2009 depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

  

index to financial statements our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 69 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures 

our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed producing reserves as of december 31 2008 will decline at estimated rates of 21 17 12 and 11 during 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities 

successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and potential 

  

index to financial statements environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective often we acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert management’s attention away from our existing operations 

the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert management’s attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include 

 

  

 the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas largely coastal waters which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2008 we owned or operated approximately 3500 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

  

index to financial statements we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 15 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 48 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2008 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operator’s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator’s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

  

index to financial statements we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2008 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar and swap agreements covering portions of our 2008 production and anticipated 2009 and 2010 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 

  

  

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

  

index to financial statements provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan because of our stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our certificate of incorporation 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors’ duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 

  

  

  

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders 

the global financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 

the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our business and our financial condition and we may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like or need to raise financing which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us additionally market conditions could have an impact on our commodity hedging arrangements if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection additionally the current economic situation could lead to further reduced demand for oil and natural gas or lower prices for oil and natural gas or both which could have a negative impact on our revenues

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business all known liabilities are accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss while the outcome and impact of such legal proceedings on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow operating results however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved 

commitment and contingency reserves 

when deemed necessary we establish reserves for certain legal proceedings the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately 21 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

while the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow operating results however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively within the united states and canada 

  

index to financial statements overview 

cabot oil  gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

at cabot there are three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and acquisition opportunities depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time at any one time one or more of these may not be economically feasible 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2007 and most of 2008 the futures market reported strong natural gas and crude oil contract prices during the fourth quarter of 2008 commodity prices experienced a sharp decline our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 839 per mcf and 8911 per bbl respectively in 2008 these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments in an effort to manage commodity price risk we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price swaps and collars these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy and assisted in the increase in our realized natural gas price from 2007 to 2008 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see “risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business” and “risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable” in item 1a 

the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2007 and 2008 “index” represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2007” and “2008” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements as applicable 

 

   

index to financial statements prices for crude oil maintained strength in 2007 and rose to record high levels in 2008 but experienced significant declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 the tables below contain the nymex monthly average crude oil price index and our realized per barrel bbl crude oil prices by month for 2007 and 2008 the “2007” and “2008” price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements 

 

 we reported earnings of 210 per share or 2113 million for 2008 an increase from the 173 per share or 1674 million reported in 2007 natural gas revenues increased from 2007 to 2008 as a result of favorable natural gas hedge settlements increased commodity market prices and increased natural gas production crude oil revenues increased from 2007 to 2008 primarily due to increased realized prices partially offset by a reduction in crude oil production prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments increased by 16 for natural gas and 33 for oil 

we drilled 432 gross wells with a success rate of 97 in 2008 compared to 461 gross wells with a success rate of 96 in 2007 total capital and exploration expenditures increased by 8448 million to 14810 million including the east texas acquisition in 2008 compared to 6362 million in 2007 we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2009 will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately 475 million any additional needs will be funded by borrowings from our credit facility we have reduced and may continue to reduce our budgeted capital and exploration spending to maintain sufficient liquidity 

our 2009 strategy will remain consistent with 2008 we will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we intend to manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity and we intend to maintain spending discipline in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the east and gulf coast regions we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and that this activity will continue to add shareholder value over the longterm 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2008 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production the private placements of debt completed in july and december 2008 the sale of common stock and to a lesser extent borrowings under our revolving credit facility and asset sales cash flows provided by operating activities borrowings the sale of common stock and proceeds from asset sales were primarily used to fund our development including acquisitions and to a lesser extent exploratory expenditures in addition to paying dividends and debt issuance costs see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

  

index to financial statements we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years commodity prices have recently experienced increased volatility due to adverse market conditions in our economy in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see “results of operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 

our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual the recent financial and credit crisis has reduced credit availability and liquidity for some companies however we believe we have adequate liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 

 

 operating activities key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 increased by 1723 million over 2007 this increase was mainly due to an increase in net income the receipt of cash of 202 million in 2008 in connection with the settlement of a dispute and an increase of 137 million in cash received for income tax refunds in addition cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of other working capital changes average realized natural gas prices increased by 16 in 2008 over 2007 and average realized crude oil prices increased by 33 over the same period equivalent production volumes increased by 11 in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of higher natural gas production we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may be lower in 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 increased by 1050 million over 2006 this increase was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for current income taxes from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the 2006 payment of approximately 102 million related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale as well as our 2007 tax net operating loss position and the receipt in 2007 of 296 million in federal tax refunds relating to our 2006 tax return average realized natural gas prices increased by one percent in 2007 over 2006 and average realized crude oil prices increased by three percent over the same period equivalent production decreased by three percent in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a decrease in crude oil production offset in part by an increase in natural gas production 

see “results of operations” for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending including the east texas acquisition and new leases in both pennsylvania and east texas and exploration expenses we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities increased by 8624 million from 2007 to 2008 and increased by 4026 million from 2006 to 2007 the increase from 2007 to 2008 was due 

  

index to financial statements to an increase of 8660 million in capital expenditures including an increase of approximately 6018 million primarily due to the 6040 million east texas acquisition and an increase of 1305 million related to unproved leasehold acquisitions primarily in northeast pennsylvania in addition there were 50 million of lower proceeds from the sale of assets in 2008 compared to 2007 partially offsetting these increases to cash used in investing activities were decreased exploration expenditures of 86 million in 2008 compared to 2007 

the increase in cash flows used in investing activities from 2006 to 2007 was due to a decrease of 3224 million in 2007 in proceeds from the sale of assets and an increase of 898 million in 2007 in capital expenditures partially offset by reduced exploration expenses of 96 million 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 7230 million from 2007 to 2008 this was primarily due to an increase in debt consisting of our july 2008 and december 2008 private placements of debt 492 million and an increase of 45 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility additionally net proceeds from the sale of common stock increased by 3111 million primarily due to the june 2008 issuance of common stock the tax benefit for stockbased compensation increased by 107 million from 2007 to 2008 but was partially offset by an increase in dividends and capitalized debt issuance costs paid 

cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 2430 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a 2100 million increase in debt principally related to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility in addition 465 million of treasury stock was purchased in 2006 compared with none in 2007 partially offsetting these increases in cash provided by financing activities were a 95 million reduction in the tax benefit for stockbased compensation lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options and higher dividend payments 

at december 31 2008 we had 185 million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 37 in december 2008 the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the commitment period for lenders holding approximately 90 of the aggregate commitments from december 2009 to october 2010 the december amendment added an accordion feature to allow us if the existing banks or new banks agree to increase the available credit line from 350 million to 450 million the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer and other assets we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our liquidity at the same time we will closely monitor the capital markets as a result of market conditions and our increased level of borrowings we may experience increased costs associated with future debt 

in july 2008 we completed a private placement of 425 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixedrate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 651 consisting of amounts due in july 2018 2020 and 2023 in december 2008 we completed a private placement of 67 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured 978 fixedrate notes due in december 2018 please refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

in june 2008 we entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 5002500 shares of common stock at a price to us of 6266 per share this aggregate share amount included 652500 shares of common stock that were issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares we received 3135 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions these net proceeds were used temporarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility prior to funding a portion of the purchase price of our east texas acquisition which closed in the third quarter of 2008 immediately prior to and in connection with this issuance we retired 5002500 shares of treasury stock which had a weightedaverage purchase price of 1646 

  

index to financial statements capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

  

 for the year ended december 31 2008 we paid dividends of 121 million on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 after the march 2007 2for1 stock split the dividend was increased to 003 per share per quarter or a 50 increase from presplit levels 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2008 

 

  

 we plan to drill approximately 148 gross wells 1223 net in 2009 compared with 432 gross wells 355 net drilled in 2008 the number of wells we plan to drill in 2009 is down from 2008 in each of our operating regions due to the underlying economic fundamentals which have significantly reduced commodity prices this 2009 drilling program includes approximately 475 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 1481 million in 2008 we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

  

index to financial statements there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization dda rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in future periods in 2009 management expects an increase in our dda rate due to higher capital costs partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years this change is currently estimated to be approximately 13 greater than 2008 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

contractual obligations 

our known material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 are set forth in the following table 

 

  

   amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2008 was 280 million up from 247 million at december 31 2007 primarily due to 12 million of accretion expense during 2008 as well as 22 million of drilling additions 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the most significant policies are discussed below 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic 

  

index to financial statements geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

since 1990 100 of our reserves have been reviewed by miller  lents ltd an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the “supplemental oil and gas information” 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves which is utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 009 to 010 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 005 to 006 impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a leasebylease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used 13 at december 31 2008 is based on management’s belief that this rate is commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil in 2008 2007 and 2006 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline there could be a significant revision in the future 

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the regions has not significantly changed during the last six months of 2008 commodity prices declined at a significant rate as the global economy struggled with a worldwide recession this price environment has resulted in reduced capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts discussed above when assessing the impairment of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 133 million or decrease by approximately 107 million respectively per year 

  

index to financial statements in the past the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions average property lives in the east gulf coast and west regions have been five four and seven years respectively average property lives in canada are estimated to be five years as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 133 under sfas no 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective under sfas no 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations 

fair value measurements 

effective january 1 2008 we adopted those provisions of sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” that were required to be adopted this adoption did not have a material impact on any of our financial statements as defined in sfas no 157 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the transaction is based on a hypothetical transaction in the principal or most advantageous market considered from the perspective of the market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 

we utilize market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable we attempt to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs we are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs sfas no 157 establishes a formal fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements and accordingly level 1 measurements should be used whenever possible 

as of december 31 2008 we had 3552 million of assets or 10 of our total assets classified as level 3 this was entirely comprised of our derivative receivable balance from our oil and gas cash flow hedges during 2008 realized gains of 3479 million were recognized in other comprehensive income derivative settlements during the year totaled 130 million the fair values of our natural gas and crude oil price collars and swaps are valued based upon quotes obtained from counterparties to the agreements and are designated as level 3 such quotes have been derived using a blackscholes model for the active oil and gas commodities market that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term although we utilize multiple quotes to assess the reasonableness of our values we have not attempted to obtain sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these derivative contracts as level 2 we adjust the fair value quotes received by our counterparties to take into account either the counterparties’ nonperformance risk or our own nonperformance 

  

index to financial statements risk we measured the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions and made a reduction to our derivative receivable in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank additional disclosures are required for transactions measured at fair value and we have included these disclosures in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

longterm employee benefit costs 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of highquality fixed income securities in order to select the discount rate we use benchmarks such as the moody’s aa corporate rate which was 554 as of december 31 2008 and the citigroup pension liability index which was 587 as of december 31 2008 we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 575 at december 31 2008 is reasonable 

in order to value our pension liabilities we use the rp2000 combined mortality table based on the demographics of our benefit plans we have also assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2008 the assumed rate of increase was 90 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the longterm to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan we attempt to maximize return over the longterm subject to appropriate levels of risk one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors’ 500 index over the longterm we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the longterm we establish the longterm expected rate of return by developing a forwardlooking longterm expected rate of return assumption for each asset class taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation in our pension calculations we have used eight percent as the expected longterm return on plan assets for 2008 2007 and 2006 a monte carlo simulation was run using 5000 simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration which has been determined to be approximately 15 years this model uses historical data for the period of 19262007 for stocks bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns the median rate of return or return that we expect to achieve over 50 percent of the time is approximately nine percent we expect to achieve at a minimum approximately 7 annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the longterm at least 75 percent of the time we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 

  

index to financial statements we generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately 50 to 80 for equity securities and approximately 20 to 40 for fixed income securities large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65 of the portfolio small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30 and 15 respectively of the portfolio fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40 of our portfolio the account will typically be fully invested however as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure part of the account may be invested in money market investments up to 20 one percent of the portfolio is invested in shortterm funds at the designated bank to meet the cash flow needs of the plan no prohibited investments including direct or indirect investments in commodities commodity futures derivatives short sales real estate investment trusts letter stock restricted stock or other private placements are allowed without prior committee approval 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation under a fair value based method of accounting for stock options and similar equity instruments under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 

stock options and stock appreciation rights sars are granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date the grant date fair value is calculated by using a blackscholes model that incorporations assumptions for stock price volatility risk free rate of return expected dividend and expected term the expected term was derived by reviewing minimum and maximum expected term outputs from the blackscholes model based on award type and employee type this term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding the stock price volatility was calculated using our historical closing stock price data for the period associated with the expected term through the grant date of each award the risk free rate of return percentages are based on the continuously compounded equivalent of the us treasury nominal 10 within the expected term as measured on the grant date the expected dividend percentage assumes that we will continue to pay a consistent level of dividend each quarter expense is recorded based on a gradedvesting schedule over a three year service period with onethird of the award becoming exercisable each year on the anniversary date of the grant the forfeiture rate is determined based on the forfeiture history by type of award and by the group of individuals receiving the award 

the fair value of restricted stock awards restricted stock units and certain performance share awards which contain vesting restrictions based either on operating income or internal performance metrics are measured based on the average of the high and low trading price of our stock on the grant date restricted stock awards primarily vest either at the end of a three year service period or on a gradedvesting basis of onethird at each anniversary date over a three year service period the annual forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards ranges from 0 to 72 based on approximately ten years of our history for this type of award to various employee groups performance shares that vest based on operating income vest on a gradedvesting basis of onethird at each anniversary date over a three year service period and no forfeiture rate is assumed performance shares that vest based on internal metrics vest at the end of a three year performance period and an annual forfeiture rate of 45 is assumed expense for restricted stock units is recorded immediately as these awards vest immediately restricted stock units are granted only to our directors and no forfeiture rate is assumed 

we grant another type of performance share award to executive employees that vest at the end of a three year performance period based on the comparative performance of our stock measured against sixteen other companies in our peer group depending on our performance up to 100 of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in stock plus an additional 100 of the fair market value of a share of our stock may be payable in cash these awards are accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components a monte 

  

index to financial statements carlo model is used to value the liability component as well as the equity portion of the certain awards on the date of grant the four primary inputs for the monte carlo model are the riskfree rate volatility of returns correlation in movement of total shareholder return and the expected dividend the riskfree rate was generated from the federal reserve website for constant maturity treasuries for one and two year bonds and is set equal to the yield for the period over the remaining duration of the performance period on treasury securities as of the reporting date volatility was set equal to the annualized daily volatility measured over a historic one and two year period ending on the reporting date correlation in movement of total shareholder return was determined based on a correlation matrix that was created which identifies total shareholder return correlations for each pair of companies in the peer group including us the paired returns in the correlation matrix ranged from approximately 71 to approximately 89 for us and our peer group the expected dividend is calculated using our dividends paid 012 for 2008 divided by the december 31 2008 closing price of our stock 2600 based on these inputs discussed above a ranking was projected identifying our rank relative to the peer group no forfeiture rate is assumed for this type of award expense related to these awards can be volatile based on our comparative ranking at the end of each quarter 

we used the shortcut approach to derive our initial windfall tax benefit pool we chose to use a onepool approach which combines all awards granted to employees including nonemployee directors 

on january 16 2008 our board of directors adopted a supplemental employee incentive plan the plan was intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for fulltime nonofficer employees by providing for cash payments in the event our common stock reached specified trading prices the bonus payout of a minimum of 50 of an employee’s base salary was triggered if for any 20 trading days which need not be consecutive that fell within a period of 60 consecutive trading days occurring on or before november 1 2011 the closing price per share of our common stock equaled or exceeded the final price goal of 60 per share the plan also provided that an interim distribution of 10 of an employee’s base salary would be paid to eligible employees upon achieving the interim price goal of 50 per share prior to december 31 2009 

on the january 16 2008 adoption date of the plan our closing stock price was 4071 on april 8 2008 and subsequently on june 2 2008 we achieved the interim and final target goals and total distributions of 157 million were paid in 2009 no further distributions will be made under this plan 

on july 24 2008 our board of directors adopted a second supplemental employee incentive plan “plan ii” plan ii is similar to the january 2008 supplemental incentive plan however the final target is that the closing price per share of our common stock must equal or exceed the price goal of 105 per share on or before june 20 2012 under plan ii each eligible employee may receive upon approval by the compensation committee a distribution of 50 of his or her base salary or 30 of base salary if we paid interim distributions upon the achievement of the interim price goal discussed below plan ii provides that a distribution of 20 of an eligible employee’s base salary upon achieving the interim price goal of 85 per share on or before june 30 2010 the compensation committee can increase the 50 or 20 payment as it applies to any employee payments under this plan will partially be paid within 15 business days after achieving the target and the remaining portion will be paid based on a separate payment date as described in plan ii 

these awards under both plans discussed above have been accounted for as liability awards under sfas no 123r and the total expense for 2008 was 159 million for further information regarding the supplemental employee incentive plans and our other stockbased compensation awards please refer to note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other issues and contingencies 

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production” “natural gas marketing gathering and 

  

index to financial statements transportation” “federal regulation of petroleum” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 our senior notes require us to maintain a ratio of cash and proved reserves to indebtedness and other liabilities of 15 to 10 at december 31 2008 we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in “capital resources and liquidity” 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see “risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2008 the sec issued release no 338995 “modernization of oil and gas reporting” which amends the oil and gas disclosures for oil and gas producers contained in regulations sk and sx as well as adding a section to regulation sk subpart 1200 to codify the revised disclosure requirements in securities act industry guide 2 which is being phased out the goal of release no 338995 is to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves energy companies affected by release no 338995 will be required to price proved oil and gas reserves using the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the 12month period prior to the end of the reporting period unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based on future conditions sec release no 338995 is effective beginning january 1 2010 we are currently evaluating what impact release no 338995 may have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

index to financial statements in june 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no emerging issues task force eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” under this fsp unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether they are paid or unpaid are considered participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method fsp no eitf 0361 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and interim periods within those years in addition all prior period earnings per share data presented should be adjusted retrospectively and early application is not permitted we do not believe that fsp no eitf 0361 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” which identifies a consistent framework for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements for nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap the current gaap hierarchy was criticized due to its complexity ranking position of fasb statements of financial accounting concepts and the fact that it is directed at auditors rather than entities sfas no 162 will be effective 60 days following the sec’s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section 411 “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles” the fasb does not expect that sfas no 162 will have a change in current practice and we do not believe that sfas no 162 will have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” which amends sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” enhanced disclosures to improve financial reporting transparency are required and include disclosure about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the financial statements how derivative instruments are accounted for and how derivatives affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows a tabular format including the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses disclosure about credit riskrelated derivative features and crossreferencing within the footnotes are also new requirements sfas no 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 with early application and comparative disclosures encouraged but not required we have not yet adopted sfas no 161 we do not believe that there will be an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas no 141r was issued in an effort to continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures it changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods certain of these changes will introduce more volatility into earnings the acquirer must now record all assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value and related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than the previous method of being capitalized as part of the acquisition sfas no 141r also impacts the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions including those that close before the effective date of sfas no 141r the definitions of a “business” and a “business combination” have been expanded resulting in more transactions qualifying as business combinations sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 31 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited we cannot predict the impact that the adoption of sfas no 141r will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to any acquisitions completed after december 31 2008

results of operations 

2008 and 2007 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2008 of 2113 million or 210 per share during 2007 we reported net income of 1674 million or 173 per share this increase of 439 million in net income was primarily due to an increase in operating revenues and gains on asset sales and settlements partially offset by increased operating interest and income tax expenses operating revenues increased by 2136 million largely due to increases in both natural gas production revenues and brokered natural gas revenues and crude oil and condensate revenues operating expenses increased by 1559 million between periods due to increases in all categories of operating expenses other than exploration expense in addition net income was impacted by an increase in gain on sale of assets and gain on settlement of dispute of 396 million as well as an increase in expenses of 534 million resulting from a combination of increased income tax expense and interest and other expenses income tax expense was higher in 2008 as a result of higher income before income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition to an increase in the effective tax rate 

natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 839 per mcf for 2008 compared to 723 per mcf for 2007 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 020 per mcf in 2008 and by 099 per mcf in 2007 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

   

index to financial statements  the increase in natural gas production revenue of 1771 million is due to the increase in realized natural gas sales prices in addition to an increase in natural gas production natural gas production in the gulf coast region increased due to increased production in the minden field largely due to the properties we acquired in east texas in august 2008 as well as increased drilling in the county line field in addition natural gas production increased in the west region associated with an increase in the drilling program increased in the east region as a result of increased drilling activity in west virginia and northeastern pennsylvania canada increased due to drilling in the hinton field 

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the increased brokered natural gas margin of 24 million is a result of an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price partially offset by a decrease in the volumes brokered in 2008 over 2007 

  

index to financial statements crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 8911 per bbl for 2008 compared to 6716 per bbl for 2007 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which decreased the price by 633 per bbl in 2008 and by 097 per bbl in 2007 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in crude oil and condensate derivative fair value in 2008 or 2007 

 

 the increase in realized crude oil prices partially offset by a decrease in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 144 million the decrease in oil production is mainly the result of a natural decline in crude oil production in the gulf coast and west regions 

  

index to financial statements impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas price agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are jpmorgan chase morgan stanley bnp paribas goldman sachs and bank of montreal 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased by 1559 million in 2008 from 2007 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

 interest expense net 

interest expense net increased by 192 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased interest expense related to the debt we issued in our july and december 2008 private placements and to a lesser extent higher average credit facility borrowings offset in part by a lower weightedaverage interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings and lower outstanding borrowings on our 719 fixed rate debt weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately 172 million during 2008 compared to approximately 52 million during 2007 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 48 during 2008 from 72 during 2007 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 342 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax income the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 370 and 350 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a one time benefit for state taxes in 2007 of approximately 28 million attributable to favorable treatment of the gain from the sale of south louisiana properties in 2006 and a reduction in special deductions in 2008 

2007 and 2006 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2007 of 1674 million or 173 per share during 2006 we reported net income of 3212 million or 332 per share this decrease of 1538 million in net income was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of 2542 million resulting from the gain on sale of assets of 2312 million included in 2006 related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale partially offset by a 992 million decrease in income tax expense and a 12 million decrease in interest and other expenses in 2007 

the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a decrease in 2007 of 2186 million in gain on sale of assets primarily from the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale additionally there was a 298 million decrease in 2007 in operating revenues and an increase of 58 million in operating expenses the decrease in operating revenues was largely the result of lower oil production in the gulf coast region primarily as a result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased dda and impairment expenses offset in part by reduced exploration and general and administrative expenses 

  

index to financial statements natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 723 per mcf for 2007 compared to 713 per mcf for 2006 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 099 per mcf in 2007 and 035 per mcf in 2006 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended december 31 2007 or 2006 

 

 the increase of 135 million in natural gas production revenue is due to an increase in realized natural gas sales prices as well as increased natural gas production natural gas revenues increased in all regions except for the gulf coast region in 2007 over 2006 after removing from the 2006 results 705 million of natural gas revenues and 9037 mmcf of natural gas production associated with properties in the gulf coast region sold in the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale total natural gas revenue would have increased by 840 million or 17 and natural gas production would have increased by 9791 mmcf or 14 from 2006 to 2007 

  

index to financial statements brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the increased brokered natural gas margin of approximately 11 million is driven by an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price partially offset by a decrease in the volumes brokered in 2007 over 2006 

  

index to financial statements crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 6716 per bbl for 2007 the 2007 price includes the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which decreased the price by 097 per bbl our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 6503 per bbl for 2006 there was no realized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2006 there was no unrealized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2007 or 2006 

 

 the decrease in the realized crude oil production partially offset by the increase in realized prices resulted in a net revenue decrease of approximately 361 million the decrease in oil production is mainly the result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale in the gulf coast region after removing from the 2006 results 474 million of crude oil revenues and 707 mbbls of crude oil production associated with properties in the gulf coast region sold in the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale total crude oil revenue would have increased by 112 million or 26 and crude oil production would have increased by 124 mbbls or 18 from 2006 to 2007 

  

index to financial statements impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased by 58 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements  interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased by 11 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a lower weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility a lower outstanding principal amount of our 719 fixed rate debt and lower weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility as well as increased income related to fin 48 as discussed below these decreases to interest expense were offset in part by decreased regulatory capitalized interest on our pipeline in the east region weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately 52 million during 2007 compared to approximately 61 million during 2006 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 72 during 2007 from 79 during 2006 in addition interest expense decreased due to the reversal of interest payable on a previous uncertain tax position during 2007 we recorded net interest income related to fin 48 of 13 million with no amount recorded in 2006 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased by 992 million due to a comparable decrease in our pretax income primarily as a result of the decrease in the gain on sale of assets the effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 350 and 371 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in our overall state income tax rate for 2007

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices are volatile and unpredictable 

the debt and equity markets have recently experienced unfavorable conditions which may affect our ability to access those markets as a result of the volatility and disruption in the capital markets and our increased level of borrowings we may experience increased costs associated with future borrowings and debt issuances at this time we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent market events we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our lenders in our revolving credit facility 

derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk 

  

index to financial statements management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks at december 31 2008 we had 26 cash flow hedges open 14 natural gas price collar arrangements 10 natural gas price swap arrangements and two crude oil price swap arrangements at december 31 2008 a 3552 million 2231 million net of tax unrealized gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  loss along with a 2647 million shortterm derivative receivable and a 905 million longterm derivative receivable 

the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income  loss the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 there was no ineffectiveness recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 

during the second quarter of 2008 in anticipation of the east texas acquisition we entered into 12 contracts for natural gas price swaps and three contracts for crude oil swaps 2009 and 2010 contracts included in the amounts discussed above for the remainder of 2008 and extending through 2010 for the purpose of reducing commodity price risk associated with anticipated production after the transaction closing 

based upon estimates at december 31 2008 we would expect to reclassify to the consolidated statement of operations over the next 12 months 1662 million in aftertax income associated with commodity hedges this reclassification represents the net shortterm receivable associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december 31 2008 related to anticipated 2009 production 

hedges on production—swaps 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 

during 2008 natural gas price swaps covered 9821 mmcf or 11 of our 2008 gas production at an average price of 1027 per mcf during 2008 we entered into natural gas price swaps covering a portion of our anticipated 2008 2009 and 2010 production including production related to the east texas acquisition 

at december 31 2008 we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering a portion of our anticipated 2009 and 2010 production as follows 

 

 we had one crude oil price swap covering 92 mbbl or 12 of our 2008 production at a price of 12715 per bbl during 2008 we entered into crude oil price swaps covering a portion of our anticipated 2008 2009 and 2010 production 

  

index to financial statements at december 31 2008 we had open crude oil price swap contracts covering a portion of our anticipated 2009 and 2010 production as follows 

 

 hedges on production—options 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us during 2008 natural gas price collars covered 54173 mmcf or 60 of our 2008 gas production with a weightedaverage floor of 853 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1070 per mcf 

at december 31 2008 we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering a portion of our anticipated 2009 production as follows 

 

 during 2008 an oil price collar covered 366 mbbls or 47 of our 2008 crude oil production with a floor of 6000 per bbl and a ceiling of 8000 per bbl 

we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 

the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain columns in the tables above represent our total unrealized gain position at december 31 2008 also impacting the total unrealized net gain reflecting the net receivable position in accumulated other comprehensive income  loss in the consolidated balance sheet is a reduction of 51 million related to our assessment of our counterparties’ nonperformance risk this risk was evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions 

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

fair market value of financial instruments 

the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate 

  

index to financial statements and the year end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes to new issues secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes excluding the credit facility are based on interest rates currently available to us the credit facility approximates fair value because this instrument bears interest at rates based on current market rates 

we use available marketing data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt

 item 1 business tableend overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties located in north america our five principal areas of operation are the appalachian basin onshore gulf coast including south and east texas and north louisiana the rocky mountains the anadarko basin and the deep gas basin of western canada operationally we have four regional offices located in houston texas charleston west virginia denver colorado and calgary alberta 

net income for 2007 of 1674 million or 173 per share was lower than the prior year’s net income of 3212 million or 332 per share by 1538 million or 48 the yearoveryear net income decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on sale of assets of 2312 million 1445 million net of tax in 2006 related to the disposition of our offshore portfolio and certain south louisiana properties to a third party which was substantially completed in 2006 the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale and to a lesser extent lower operating revenues as discussed below additionally operating expenses increased by 58 million between 2006 and 2007 principally due to increased depreciation depletion and amortization costs and impairment charges partially offset by lower exploration and general and administrative expenses these lower operating revenues and increased operating expenses along with a 12 million decrease in interest and other expense reduced income before income taxes by 2530 million and consequently decreased income tax expense by 992 million also contributing to the decrease in income taxes was the decrease in the effective tax rate primarily due to a reduction in our overall state income tax liability for 2007 relating to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale

index to financial statements operating revenues decreased by 298 million or four percent over the prior year as described below natural gas production revenues increased by 135 million or two percent over the prior year due to an increase in realized natural gas prices and an increase in natural gas production in the west region east region and canada partially offset by decreased natural gas production in the gulf coast region as a result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale crude oil and condensate revenues decreased by 362 million or 40 over the prior year mainly due to decreased crude oil and condensate production in the gulf coast region as a result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale partially offset by an increase in crude oil realized prices excluding 705 million and 474 million respectively of natural gas and crude oil revenues from our 2006 results that were attributable to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale natural gas revenues for 2007 would have increased by 17 and crude oil revenues would have increased by 26 brokered natural gas revenues decreased by 05 million due to a decrease in brokered volumes offset in part by an increase in sales price 

in 2007 energy commodity prices remained strong throughout the year our 2007 average realized natural gas price was 723 per mcf one percent higher than the 2006 average realized price of 713 our 2007 average realized crude oil price was 6716 per bbl three percent higher than the 2006 average realized price of 6503 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives zerocost collars or swaps for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to the “results of operations” section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k our balance sheet strengthened by the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale and a hedge position covering approximately half of our anticipated production at levels exceeding our budgeted prices allowed us to once again expand our capital program in 2007 we pursued and completed the largest investment program in our history 6362 million which was funded largely through cash flow from operations and to a lesser extent borrowings on our revolving credit facility we believe our balance sheet and availability under our credit facility provides sufficient liquidity to pursue our 2008 program and evaluate other opportunities 

on an equivalent basis our production level in 2007 decreased by three percent from 2006 we produced 855 bcfe or 2341 mmcfe per day in 2007 as compared to 882 bcfe or 2417 mmcfe per day in 2006 natural gas production increased to 805 bcf in 2007 from 797 bcf in 2006 primarily due to increased production in the west and east regions associated with an increase in the drilling program and an increase in canada due to increased pipeline capacity and drilling activity in the hinton field partially offset by a decline in gulf coast production excluding 90 bcf of natural gas production sold in the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale total natural gas production would have increased by 14 gulf coast natural gas production decreased from 299 bcf in 2006 to 268 bcf in 2007 primarily due to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale excluding 90 bcf of production sold in that sale gulf coast production would have increased 28 in 2007 over 2006 primarily due to increased drilling in the minden angie county line and mccampbell fields and recompletions in the raymondville field oil production decreased by 582 mbbls from 1405 mbbls in 2006 to 823 mbbls in 2007 due primarily to a decrease in production in the gulf coast region excluding 707 mbbls of crude oil production related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale oil production would have increased by 18 from 2006 to 2007 mainly due to an increase in drilling and workover activity in the mccampbell field and to a lesser extent in the minden field oil production increased slightly in the east region and in canada and decreased by 17 in the west region due to natural decline excluding 133 bcfe of equivalent production sold in the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale total equivalent production would have increased by 106 bcfe or 14 

a portion of our production was covered by oil and gas hedge instruments throughout 2006 and 2007 again during 2007 as in 2006 we employed the use of collars to hedge our price exposure on our production in addition at the end of 2007 we employed the use of cash flow swaps to cover a portion of our 2008 natural gas production for 2007 collars covered 53 of natural gas production and had a weightedaverage floor of 899 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1219 per mcf at december 31 2007 approximately 38 of the anticipated 2008 natural gas production is hedged using collars with a weightedaverage floor of 817 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1014 per mcf swaps as of december 31 2007 cover approximately six percent of our anticipated 2008 natural gas production with a weightedaverage price of 744 per mcf for 2007 collars covered 44 of crude oil production with a floor of 6000 per bbl and a ceiling of 8000 per bbl at december 31 2007 approximately 49 of our anticipated crude oil production is hedged for 2008 with a floor of

index to financial statements 6000 per bbl and a ceiling of 8000 per bbl as of december 31 2007 no derivatives are in place for 2009 our decision to hedge 2008 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows us to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production 

for the year ended december 31 2007 we drilled 461 gross wells 391 net with a success rate of 96 compared to 387 gross wells 307 net with a success rate of 96 for the prior year in 2008 we plan to drill approximately 419 gross wells 366 net the number of wells we plan to drill in 2008 is down from 2007 primarily due to lower planned activity in the rocky mountains area based on lower natural gas prices and lower planned activity in canada based on uncertainty around royalties and exchange rates our 2007 capital and exploration spending was 6362 million compared to 5375 million of total capital and exploration spending in 2006 in both 2007 and 2006 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2008 funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and increased borrowings if required we remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results and selectively pursuing impact exploration opportunities as we accelerate drilling on our accumulated acreage position for 2008 the gulf coast region will start the year with the largest allocation of capital followed by the east the west and canada we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term in 2008 we plan to spend approximately 490 million on capital and exploration activities 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 1616 bcfe at december 31 2007 of which 97 was natural gas this reserve level was up by 14 percent from 1416 bcfe at december 31 2006 on the strength of results from our drilling program and the increase in our capital spending 

the following table presents certain reserve production and well information as of december 31 2007 

 

  

  on september 29 2006 we substantially completed the sale of our offshore portfolio and certain south louisiana properties to phoenix exploration company lp phoenix for a gross sales price of 3400 million we received approximately 3333 million in net proceeds from the sale in addition to the net gain of 2312 million 1445 million net of tax recorded in 2006 we recorded a net gain of 123 million 77 million net of tax in the consolidated statement of operations in 2007 which included cash proceeds of 58 million received in the first quarter of 2007 21 million in purchase price adjustments and 44 million that had been deferred until legal title to certain properties could be assigned 

our interest in both developed and undeveloped properties is primarily in the form of leasehold interests held under customary mineral leases these leases provide us the right in general to develop oil andor natural gas on the properties their primary terms range in length from approximately three to seven years these properties are

index to financial statements east region 

our east region activities are concentrated primarily in west virginia this region is managed from our office in charleston west virginia in this region our assets include a large acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity 

capital and exploration expenditures for 2007 were 1786 million or 28 of our total 2007 capital and exploration expenditures compared to 1454 million for 2006 or 27 of our total 2006 capital and exploration expenditures of the total company yearoveryear increase in capital and exploration expenditures 23 was attributable to an increase in the east region spending for 2008 we have budgeted approximately 189 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

at december 31 2007 we had 3178 wells 29622 net of which 3085 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include the big lime weir berea and devonian shale formations at depths primarily ranging from 1000 to 9500 feet with an average depth of approximately 4000 feet average net daily production in 2007 was 671 mmcfe natural gas and crude oilcondensatengl production for 2007 was 244 bcf and 26 mbbls respectively 

while natural gas production volumes from east reservoirs are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states the productive life of east region reserves is relatively long at december 31 2007 we had 7784 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the east region constituting 48 of our total proved reserves developed and undeveloped reserves made up 5512 bcfe and 2272 bcfe of the total proved reserves for the east region respectively while no properties are individually significant to our company as a whole the sissonville pineville loganholdendingess big creek hernshawbullcreek and huff creek fields in west virginia are included in our ten largest fields and together contain approximately 29 of our total company proved equivalent reserves 

in 2007 we drilled 254 wells 2446 net in the east region of which 250 wells 2408 net were development and extension wells in 2008 we plan to drill approximately 265 wells 2585 net primarily in west virginia including the sissonville pineville loganholdendingess big creek huff creek and hernshawbullcreek fields 

in 2007 we produced and marketed approximately 71 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the east region at market responsive prices 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operated a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2007 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the east region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

  

 9  

index to financial statements the principal markets for our east region natural gas are in the northeast united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system 

approximately 70 of our natural gas sales volume in the east region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one year or greater in addition spot market sales are made at indexbased prices under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately two percent of east production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually 

gulf coast region 

our development exploitation exploration and production activities in the gulf coast region are primarily concentrated in east and south texas and north louisiana a regional office in houston manages the operations principal producing intervals are in the cotton valley and james lime formations in north louisiana and east texas and the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas at depths ranging from 2200 to 17700 feet with an average depth of approximately 10800 feet

risk management 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2007 we employed natural gas price collar and swap agreements and crude oil price collar agreements for portions of our 2007 and 2008 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place in 2006 and 2005 we also employed natural gas and crude oil price collar agreements additionally in 2005 we employed natural gas price swap agreements at december 31 2007 we have natural gas price collar and swap arrangements and crude oil price collar arrangements in place for 2008 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review 

  

 20  

index to financial statements and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas the ferc established new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increases the penalties for violations of the nga 

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established interim rules governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates and has initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether to make those rules permanent the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation

index to financial statements establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections we have substantially completed the required initial inspection baseline assessment of our pipeline systems in west virginia and expect to complete that assessment within the required timeline we are not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of these rules on our facilities or our business 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in march 2006 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 13 percent should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2006 

another ferc proceeding that may impact our transportation costs relates to an ongoing proceeding to determine whether and to what extent pipelines should be permitted to include in their transportation rates an allowance for income taxes attributable to noncorporate partnership interests following a court remand the ferc has established a policy that a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity is entitled to a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or potential income tax liability” to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the ferc’s new policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 

  

 22  

index to financial statements also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed 

oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act  the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 

these factors include

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 

   

 25  

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

   

 26  

index to financial statements these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

high demand for field services and equipment and the ability of suppliers to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our natural gas and oil properties 

due to current industry demands well service providers and related equipment and personnel are in short supply this may cause escalating prices delays in drilling and other exploration activities the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries such pressures would likely increase the actual cost of services extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to any accidents sustained from the over use of equipment and inexperienced personnel 

our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 69 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures

index to financial statements our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed producing reserves as of december 31 2007 will decline at estimated rates of three percent 15 13 and 10 during 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

from time to time we may identify and evaluate opportunities to acquire natural gas and oil properties we may not be able to successfully consummate any acquisition to acquire producing natural gas and oil properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or to integrate the properties into our operations profitably 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas largely coastal waters which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2007 we owned or operated approximately 3300 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

  

 28  

index to financial statements we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 15 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 47 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2007 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operator’s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator’s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2007 we employed natural gas price collar and swap agreements and crude oil price collar agreements covering portions of our 2007 production and anticipated 2008 production to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether 

  

 29  

index to financial statements the market price of natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 

  

  

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan because of our stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

  

 30  

index to financial statements the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our certificate of incorporation 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors’ duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 

  

  

  

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

west virginia royalty litigation 

in december 2001 we were sued by two royalty owners in west virginia state court for an unspecified amount of damages the plaintiffs requested class certification and alleged that we failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas that we had taken improper deductions from the royalty and that we failed to properly inform royalty owners of the deductions the plaintiffs also claimed that they are entitled to a 18th royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement that we reached with columbia gas transmission corporation in 1995 bankruptcy proceedings the court entered an order on june 1 2005 granting the motion for class certification 

the parties reached a tentative settlement in 2007 pursuant to which we paid 116 million into a trust fund which will disburse the settlement proceeds to the class members upon final approval of the settlement by the court these restricted cash funds are held by a financial institution in west virginia under the joint custody of the plaintiffs and us these funds have been classified within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet subsequent to reaching the tentative settlement it was determined that an additional payment of 04 million 

  

 31  

index to financial statements would be required to account for production from new wells that came online during the process of settlement negotiations and were not included in the volumes upon which the 116 million settlement was reached the additional funds bring the total to be paid by us to 120 million 

in the tentative settlement we also agreed with the class members to a methodology for payment of future royalties and the reporting format such methodology will take the tentative settlement was not to be final or binding until approved by the court the hearing for final approval of the settlement was held on february 12 2008 the court approved the final settlement at the hearing upon filing of the written order of approval by the court the process will begin for distribution of the settlement proceeds from the trust we had provided a reserve sufficient to cover the amount agreed upon to settle this litigation 

commitment and contingency reserves 

we have established reserves for certain legal proceedings the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately 84 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

while the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow operating results however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively within the united states and canada 

overview 

cabot oil  gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

at cabot there are three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock and to a lesser extent acquisition opportunities depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time at any one time one or more of these may not be economically feasible 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2006 and 2007 the futures market reported strong natural gas and crude oil contract prices our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 723 per mcf and 6716 per bbl respectively in 2007 these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments in an effort to manage commodity price risk we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy and assisted in the increase in our realized natural gas price from 2006 to 2007 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see “risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business” and “risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable” in item 1a

index to financial statements the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2006 and 2007 “index” represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2006” and “2007” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements as applicable 

 

 we reported earnings of 173 per share or 1674 million for 2007 this is down from the 332 per share or 3212 million reported in 2006 earnings decreased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the 2312 million 1445 million net of tax gain recorded in 2006 related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale natural gas revenues increased from 2006 to 2007 as a result of an increase in realized prices resulting from favorable natural gas hedge settlements and increased natural gas production crude oil revenues decreased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to decreased gulf coast production related primarily to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments increased by one percent for natural gas and three percent for oil 

we drilled 461 gross wells with a success rate of 96 in 2007 compared to 387 gross wells with a success rate of 96 in 2006 total capital and exploration expenditures increased by 987 million to 6362 million in 2007 compared to 5375 million in 2006 we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in 2008 will be sufficient to fund a substantial portion of our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately 490 million any additional needs will be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 

our 2008 strategy will remain consistent with 2007 we will remain focused on our strategy of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our accumulated acreage position additionally we will continue to add to our acreage position in certain areas for future drilling opportunities in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions we believe that these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current industry environment and that this activity will continue to add shareholder value over the long term 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read “forwardlooking information” for further details

index to financial statements financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2007 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production and borrowings under our revolving credit facility cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund development and to a lesser extent exploratory expenditures and to pay dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see “results of operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 

working capital is also substantially influenced by these variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 

 

 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 increased by 1050 million over 2006 this increase was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for current income taxes from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to the 2006 payment of approximately 102 million related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale as well as our 2007 tax net operating loss position and the receipt in 2007 of 296 million in federal tax refunds relating to our 2006 tax return key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased by one percent in 2007 over 2006 and average crude oil realized prices increased by three percent over the same period equivalent production decreased by three percent in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of a decrease in crude oil production offset in part by an increase in natural gas production we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 decreased by 75 million over 2005 this decrease was primarily due to an increase in current income tax expense partially offset by an increase in earnings and an increase in working capital changes the increase in cash paid for income taxes from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to the december 2006 payment of approximately 102 million related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale other factors impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased six percent over 2005 while crude oil realized prices increased 47 over the same period equivalent production increased by five percent in 2006 compared to 2005 

see “results of operations” for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities increased by 4026 million from 2006 to 2007 and decreased by 2248 million from 2005 to 2006 the increase from 2006 to 2007 was due to a decrease of 3224 million in 2007 in proceeds from the sale of assets and an increase of 898 million in 2007 in capital expenditures partially offset by reduced exploration expenses of 96 million 

  

 38  

index to financial statements cash flows used in investments in capital and exploration expenditures were 5168 million in 2006 compared to 4131 million used in 2005 in response to higher commodity prices this increase of 1037 million in investments in capital and exploration expenses was entirely offset by the increase of 3285 million in proceeds from the sale of assets primarily as a result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale 

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were 1044 million for 2007 and contained a net increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by dividend payments cash flows used in financing activities were 1385 million for 2006 and were comprised of payments made to decrease outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility to purchase treasury stock and to pay dividends partially offsetting these cash uses were inflows from the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit received from stockbased compensation cash flows provided by financing activities were 482 million for 2005 resulting from borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments 

at december 31 2007 we had 140 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 69 the credit facility provides for an available credit line of 250 million which can be expanded up to 350 million either with the existing banks or new banks the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer and other assets the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december 2009 we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings if necessary our capital requirements including potential acquisitions 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may purchase shares of common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions there is no expiration date associated with the authorization we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2007 all purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of december 31 2007 was 4795300 see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

  

 for the year ended december 31 2007 we paid dividends of 107 million on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 after the march 2007 2for1 stock split the dividend was increased to 003 per share per quarter or a 50 increase from presplit levels 

  

 39  

index to financial statements increase in authorized shares 

on may 4 2006 our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 80 million to 120 million shares we correspondingly increased the number of shares of series a junior participating preferred stock reserved for issuance from 800000 to 1200000 the shares of series a junior participating preferred stock are issuable pursuant to our rights agreement with the bank of new york as rights agent 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2007 

 

 we plan to drill approximately 419 gross wells 366 net in 2008 compared with 461 gross wells 391 net drilled in 2007 the number of wells we plan to drill in 2008 is down from 2007 primarily due to lower planned activity in the rocky mountains area based on lower natural gas prices and lower planned activity in canada based on uncertainty around royalties and exchange rates this 2008 drilling program includes approximately 490 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 6362 million in 2007 we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization dda rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period in 2008 management expects an increase in our dda rate due to higher capital costs partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last four years this change is currently estimated to be approximately five percent greater than 2007 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

contractual obligations 

our known material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

during 2006 we assisted certain nonexecutive employees in obtaining loans to purchase interests offered under our mineral royalty and overriding royalty interest plan by providing a guarantee of repayment should the nonexecutive employee fail to repay the loan the repayment term for all of these loans was five years the outstanding loan balances were approximately 03 million in the aggregate as of december 31 2006 and the fair value of these guarantees were immaterial to our financial statements there were no outstanding loan balances as of december 31 2007 all loans were collateralized by the interests transferred to the employees in the producing properties 

  

 40  

index to financial statements a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 are set forth in the following table 

 

  

   amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2007 was 247 million up from 227 million at december 31 2006 primarily due to 10 million of accretion expense during 2007 as well as 16 million of drilling additions 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the most significant policies are discussed below 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds 

since 1990 100 of our reserves have been reviewed by miller  lents ltd an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the “supplemental oil and gas information” 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves which is utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower 

  

 41  

index to financial statements market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 008 to 009 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 001 to 002 impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a leasebylease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows in 2007 2006 and 2005 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 86 million or decrease by approximately 65 million respectively per year 

in the past the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions average property lives in the east gulf coast and west regions have been six four and seven years respectively average property lives in canada are estimated to be five years as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 133 under sfas no 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective under sfas no 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations

index to financial statements longterm employee benefit costs 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of highquality fixed income securities in order to select the discount rate we use benchmarks such as the moody’s aa corporate rate which was 58 as of december 31 2007 and the citigroup pension liability index which was 648 as of december 31 2007 we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 60 at december 31 2007 is reasonable 

in order to value our pension liabilities we use the rp2000 combined mortality table this is a widely accepted table used for valuing pension liabilities this table represents a more recent and conservative mortality table than the 1983 group annuity mortality table and appears to be an appropriate table based on the demographics of our benefit plans another consideration that is made is a salary scale selection we have assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2007 the assumed rate of increase was 90 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan we attempt to maximize return over the longterm subject to appropriate levels of risk one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors’ 500 index over the long term we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the longterm in our pension calculations we have used eight percent as the expected longterm return on plan assets for 2007 2006 and 2005 a monte carlo simulation was run using 5000 simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration which has been determined to be approximately 16 years this model uses historical data for the period of 19262003 for stocks bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns the median rate of return or return that we expect to achieve over 50 percent of the time is approximately nine percent we expect to achieve a minimum 64 annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term at least 75 percent of the time in addition the actual rate of return on plan assets annualized over the past ten years is approximately six percent we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results 

we generally target a portfolio of assets utilizing equity securities fixed income securities and cash equivalents that are within a range of approximately 50 to 80 for equity securities and approximately 20 to 40 for fixed income securities large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65 of the portfolio small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30 and 15 respectively of the portfolio fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40 of our portfolio the account will typically be fully invested however as a temporary investment or an asset protection measure part of the account may be

stockbased compensation 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the accounting policies described in sfas no 123r “share based payment revised 2004” we chose to use the modified prospective method of transition and accordingly no adjustments to prior period financial statements were made prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stockbased compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” under this method we recognized compensation cost as the excess if any of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock in addition sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” outlines a fair value based method of accounting for stock options or similar equity instruments under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used 

one primary difference in our method of accounting after the adoption of sfas no 123r is that unvested stock options are now expensed as a component of stockbased compensation cost in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations this expense is based on the fair value of the award at the original grant date and is recognized over the vesting period prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we included this amount as a proforma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the expense resulting from the expensing of stock options was 01 million and 03 million for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively another change relates to the accounting for our performance share awards certain of these awards are now accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components a monte carlo model is used to value the liability component rather than accounting for the award using the average closing stock price at the end of each reporting period all other awards are accounted for in substantially the same way as they were or would have been in prior periods with the exception of the differences noted below 

other differences in the way we account for stockbased compensation after january 1 2006 result from the application of a forfeiture rate to all grants rather than only recording actual forfeitures as they occur we are now required to estimate forfeitures on all equitybased compensation and adjust periodic expense upon adoption we did not report a cumulative effect adjustment for these forfeitures as the amount was immaterial in addition this change in accounting for forfeitures resulted in an immaterial change in overall compensation cost for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 furthermore we are required to expense certain awards to retirementeligible employees in the month an employee becomes retirement eligible depending on the structure of each individual plan the retirementeligibility provision only applies to new grants that were awarded after january 1 2006 the total expense that we recognized related to restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights granted to retirementeligible employees in 2007 and 2006 was 06 million in each year 

we issued stock appreciation rights to executive officers for the first time during the first quarter of 2006 the grant date fair value of these awards is measured using a blackscholes model and compensation cost is expensed over the three year gradedvesting service period expense related to these awards was 15 million and 10 million before the effect of taxes for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

in addition two new types of performance shares were issued to employees during 2007 and 2006 during 2007 we issued to executive officers a new type of performance share award that vests depending on our operating income these awards vest based on a threeyear graded vesting service period vesting onethird on each anniversary date following the date of grant provided that we have positive operating income if we do not have positive operating income for the year preceding a vesting date then the portions of the award that would have vested on that date will be forfeited compensation cost related to these new operatingincome based performance

index to financial statements share awards granted to employees was 17 million before the effect of taxes for 2007 a second new type of performance share award issued to nonexecutive employees for the first time in 2006 and again in 2007 measures our performance based on three internal metrics rather than a peer group’s stock performance which we use to measure certain other performance share awards these awards cliff vest at the end of the three year service period compensation cost related to these internalmetric based performance share awards granted to employees was 47 million and 14 million before the effect of taxes for 2007 and 2006 respectively total performance share expense related to all types of performance share awards before the effect of taxes was 94 million for 2007 and 129 million for 2006 a 06 million 04 million net of tax cumulative effect charge incurred during the first quarter of 2006 is included in 2006 performance share expense within general and administrative expenses due to its immateriality as a result of changes made in our accounting for performance shares for further information on the accounting for these and our other stockbased compensation awards please refer to notes 1 and 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

during the third quarter of 2006 we adopted the provisions outlined under financial accounting standard board fasb staff position fsp fas no 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards” which discusses accounting for taxes for stock awards using the apic pool concept we made a one time election as prescribed under the fsp to use the shortcut approach to derive the initial windfall tax benefit pool we chose to use a onepool approach which combines all awards granted to employees including nonemployee directors 

our compensation committee of our board of directors made one modification to our stock option awards in 2005 it approved the acceleration to december 15 2005 of the vesting of 198799 unvested stock options awarded in february 2003 under our second amended and restated 1994 longterm incentive plan and 24500 unvested stock options awarded in april 2004 under our 2004 incentive plan 

the 198799 shares awarded to employees under the 1994 plan at an exercise price of 1532 would have vested in february 2006 the 24500 shares awarded to nonemployee directors under the 2004 plan at an exercise price of 2332 would have vested 12250 shares in each of april 2006 and april 2007 the decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options which we believed to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative burden associated with our adoption of sfas no 123r the accelerated vesting of the options did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for 2005 the acceleration of vesting reduced our compensation expense related to these options by approximately 02 million for 2006 

uncertain tax positions 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation number fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” this adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements this interpretation provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions as defined in sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under fin 48 we now conduct a twostep process for accounting for income tax uncertainties first we perform an analysis to determine if a threshold condition of “more likely than not” is met to determine whether any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position should be recognized in the financial statements next if the recognition threshold is met we measure the amount of the uncertain tax position to be recognized based on additional guidance prescribed in fin 48 under fin 48 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement guidance is also provided regarding derecognition classification interest and penalties interim period accounting transition and increased disclosure of these uncertain tax position for further information regarding the adoption of fin no 48 please refer to note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

corporate income tax  we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum

index to financial statements tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions for corporations other than integrated oil companies the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference cannot reduce a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production” “natural gas marketing gathering and transportation” “federal regulation of petroleum” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at december 31 2007 we are in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in “capital resources and liquidity” 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see “risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collars and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in our not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 51” sfas no 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest previously commonly referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary is an ownership

index to financial statements interest in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements the presentation of the consolidated income statement has been changed by sfas no 160 and consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest is now required to be reported separately previously net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest was typically reported as an expense or other deduction in arriving at consolidated net income and was often combined with other financial statement amounts in addition the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent must be clearly identified labeled and presented in the equity in the consolidated financial statements separately from the parent’s equity subsequent changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for consistently and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated any retained noncontrolling equity interest in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value expanded disclosures including a reconciliation of equity balances of the parent and noncontrolling interest are also required sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited prospective application is required at this time we do not have any material noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries therefore we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 160 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas no 141r was issued in an effort to continue the movement toward the greater use of fair values in financial reporting and increased transparency through expanded disclosures it changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods certain of these changes will introduce more volatility into earnings the acquirer must now record all assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value and related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than the previous method of being capitalized as part of the acquisition sfas no 141r also impacts the annual goodwill impairment test associated with acquisitions including those that close before the effective date of sfas no 141r the definitions of a “business” and a “business combination” have been expanded resulting in more transactions qualifying as business combinations sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 31 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited we cannot predict the impact that the adoption of sfas no 141r will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to any acquisitions completed after december 31 2007 

in may 2007 the fasb issued fsp no fin 481 “definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48” which amends fin 48 and provides guidance concerning how an entity should determine whether a tax position is “effectively” rather than the previously required “ultimately” settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits in addition fsp no fin 481 provides guidance on determining whether a tax position has been effectively settled the guidance in fsp no fin 481 is effective upon the initial january 1 2007 adoption of fin 48 companies that have not applied this guidance must retroactively apply the provisions of this fsp to the date of the initial adoption of fin 48 we have adopted fsp no fin 481 and no retroactive adjustments were necessary 

in april 2007 the fasb issued fsp no fin 391 “amendment of fasb interpretation no 39” to amend fin 39 “offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts” the terms “conditional contracts” and “exchange contracts” used in fin 39 have been replaced with the more general term “derivative contracts” in addition fsp no fin 391 permits the offsetting of recognized fair values for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against fair values of derivatives under certain circumstances such as under master netting arrangements additional disclosure is also required regarding a company’s accounting policy with respect to offsetting fair value amounts the guidance in fsp no fin 391 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 with early application allowed the effects of initial adoption should be recognized as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application for all periods presented we do not believe that the adoption of fsp no fin 391 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

index to financial statements specified dates to measure certain eligible financial instruments at fair value the objective of this statement is to reduce volatility in preparer reporting that may be caused as a result of measuring related financial assets and liabilities differently and to expand the use of fair value measurements the provisions of the statement apply only to entities that elect to use the fair value option and to all entities with availableforsale and trading securities additional disclosures are also required for instruments for which the fair value option is elected sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 no retrospective application is allowed except for companies that choose to adopt early at the effective date companies may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date and the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value must be reported as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings since we have not elected to adopt the fair value option for eligible items we do not believe that sfas no 159 will have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which establishes a formal framework for measuring fair values of assets and liabilities in financial statements that are already required by united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be measured at fair value sfas no 157 clarifies guidance in fasb concepts statement con no 7 which discusses present value techniques in measuring fair value additional disclosures are also required for transactions measured at fair value sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 in november 2007 the fasb granted a one year deferral to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to comply with sfas no 157 we do not believe that sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

results of operations 

2007 and 2006 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2007 of 1674 million or 173 per share during 2006 we reported net income of 3212 million or 332 per share this decrease of 1538 million in net income was primarily due to a decrease in operating income of 2542 million resulting from the gain on sale of assets of 2312 million included in 2006 related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale partially offset by a 992 million decrease in income tax expense and a 12 million decrease in interest and other expenses in 2007 

the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a decrease in 2007 of 2186 million in gain on sale of assets primarily from the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale additionally there was a 298 million decrease in 2007 in operating revenues and an increase of 58 million in operating expenses the decrease in operating revenues was largely the result of lower oil production in the gulf coast region primarily as a result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increased dda and impairment expenses offset in part by reduced exploration and general and administrative expenses

index to financial statements natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 723 per mcf for 2007 compared to 713 per mcf for 2006 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which increased the price by 099 per mcf in 2007 and 035 per mcf in 2006 there was no revenue impact from the unrealized change in natural gas derivative fair value for the years ended december 31 2007 or 2006 

 

 the increase of 135 million in natural gas production revenue is due to an increase in realized natural gas sales prices as well as increased natural gas production natural gas revenues increased in all regions except for the gulf coast region in 2007 over 2006 after removing from the 2006 results 705 million of natural gas revenues and 9037 mmcf of natural gas production associated with properties in the gulf coast region sold in the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale total natural gas revenue would have increased by 840 million or 17 and natural gas production would have increased by 9791 mmcf or 14 from 2006 to 2007 

  

 49  

index to financial statements brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the increased brokered natural gas margin of approximately 11 million is driven by an increase in sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase price partially offset by a decrease in the volumes brokered in 2007 over 2006

index to financial statements crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 6716 per bbl for 2007 the 2007 price includes the realized impact of derivative instrument settlements which decreased the price by 097 per bbl our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 6503 per bbl for 2006 there was no realized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2006 there was no unrealized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2007 or 2006 

 

 the decrease in the realized crude oil production partially offset by the increase in realized prices resulted in a net revenue decrease of approximately 362 million the decrease in oil production is mainly the result of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale in the gulf coast region after removing from the 2006 results 474 million of crude oil revenues and 707 mbbls of crude oil production associated with properties in the gulf coast region sold in the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale total crude oil revenue would have increased by 112 million or 26 and crude oil production would have increased by 124 mbbls or 18 from 2006 to 2007

index to financial statements impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased by 58 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows

 interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased by 11 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a lower weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility a lower outstanding principal amount of our 719 fixed rate debt and lower weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility as well as increased income related to fin 48 as discussed below these decreases to interest expense were offset in part by decreased regulatory capitalized interest on our pipeline in the east region weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on daily balances were approximately 52 million during 2007 compared to approximately 61 million during 2006 the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility decreased to 72 during 2007 from 79 during 2006 in addition interest expense decreased due to the reversal of interest payable on a previous uncertain tax position during 2007 we recorded net interest income related to fin 48 of 13 million with no amount recorded in 2006 

income tax expense 

income tax expense decreased by 992 million due to a comparable decrease in our pretax income primarily as a result of the decrease in the gain on sale of assets the effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 350 and 371 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in our overall state income tax rate for 2007 

2006 and 2005 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2006 of 3212 million or 332 per share during 2005 we reported net income of 1484 million or 152 per share net income increased in 2006 by 1728 million primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the gain of 2312 million 1445 million net of tax recorded in 2006 related to the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale as well as an increase in natural gas and oil production revenues this increase is partially offset by an increase in total operating expenses of 410 million and an increase of 1015 million in income tax expense operating income increased by 2702 million compared to the prior year from 2587 million in 2005 to 5289 million in 2006

index to financial statements natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price for 2006 including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 713 per mcf compared to 674 per mcf for the prior year these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which increased these prices by 035 per mcf in 2006 and reduced these prices by 133 per mcf in 2005 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2005 there was no unrealized impact from the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2006 these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in natural gas production revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

 the increase in natural gas production revenue is due to the increase in natural gas sales production and to a lesser extent the increase in realized natural gas prices production increased in all regions and prices were up in the gulf coast and west the increase in the total realized natural gas price and production resulted in a net revenue increase of 700 million excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments this growth primarily resulted from our 2005 and 2006 drilling programs which focused on projects in basins traditionally known for gas development including the east region the minden field in the gulf coast and canada this natural gas production increase includes the effects of the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale for the year ended december 31 2006 natural gas volumes from the properties sold in the third quarter 2006 disposition were 9037 mmcf and natural gas revenues from those properties were approximately 705 million

our average total company realized crude oil sales price for 2006 was 6503 per bbl there was no realized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2006 our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 4419 per bbl for 2005 including the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced the price by 993 per bbl the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 55 million for the year ended december 31 2005 there was no unrealized impact from the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2006 these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in crude oil and condensate revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

 the increase in the realized crude oil price offset by the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 145 million excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of decreased gulf coast production from the 2006 south louisiana and offshore properties sale in the third quarter of 2006 and the continued natural decline of the clf lease in south louisiana which was part of the sale for the year ended december 31 2006 crude oil and condensate volumes from the properties sold in the third quarter disposition were 707 mbbls and crude oil and condensate revenues from those properties were approximately 474 million

 we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased by 410 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the primary reasons for this fluctuation were as follows

 interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased by 34 million due to lower borrowings on our 719 fixed rate debt and increased interest on our short term investments as well as the commencement of regulatory interest capitalization on our pipeline in the east region offset partially by higher average credit facility borrowings as well as an increasing interest rate environment weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances were approximately 61 million during 2006 compared to 32 million during 2005 in addition the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility increased to 79 during 2006 from 69 during the prior year 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 1015 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax income primarily as a result of the gain on the sale of assets recorded in the third quarter of 2006 the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 371 and 372 respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production under our revolving credit agreement the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100 of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges at december 31 2007 we had 16 cash flow hedges open 12 natural gas price collar arrangements three natural gas swap arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement at december 31 2007 a 73 million 46 million net of tax unrealized gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income along with a 127 million shortterm derivative receivable and a 54 million shortterm derivative liability the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective

index to financial statements portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate during 2007 and 2006 there was no ineffectiveness recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2005 a 66 million gain was recorded as a component of revenue which reflected the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in the fair value of all other derivatives 

assuming no change in commodity prices after december 31 2007 we would expect to reclassify to the consolidated statement of operations over the next 12 months 46 million in aftertax income associated with commodity hedges this reclassification represents the net shortterm receivable associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december 31 2007 related to anticipated 2008 production 

hedges on production – swaps 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures during 2007 we did not enter into any natural gas price swaps covering our 2007 production 

at december 31 2007 we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering a portion of our 2008 production as follows 

 

 hedges on production – options 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us during 2007 natural gas price collars covered 42533 mmcf of our gas production or 53 of our gas production with a weightedaverage floor of 899 per mcf and a weightedaverage ceiling of 1219 per mcf

at december 31 2007 we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering a portion of our 2008 production as follows 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

 item 1 business tableend overview 

cabot oil  gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties located in north america our five principal areas of operation are the appalachian basin the gulf coast including south and east texas and north louisiana the rocky mountains the anadarko basin and the deep gas basin of western canada operationally we have four regional offices located in houston texas charleston west virginia denver colorado and calgary alberta 

net income for 2006 of 3212 million or 664 per share exceeded the prior year’s net income of 1484 million or 304 per share by 1728 million or 116 over the prior year net income the yearoveryear net income increase was achieved primarily due to the recognition of a gain of 2312 million 1445 million net of tax in 2006 related to the disposition of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties along with higher realized natural gas and crude oil production revenues as a result of more favorable settlements of production hedges on natural gas and increases in crude oil prices these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses of 410 million between 2005 and 2006 higher operating expenses were principally due to increased depreciation depletion and amortization costs general and administrative expenses and direct operations expenses in addition income tax expenses increased by 1015 million primarily as a result of the gain on the disposition of properties discussed above at december 31 2006 our debttototalcapital ratio was 20 down from 36 at the end of 2005 

operating revenues increased by 792 million or 12 over the prior year due to increased natural gas production as well as strong realized commodity prices natural gas production revenues increased by 689 million or 14 over the prior year due to increased natural gas production in all regions as well as higher realized natural gas prices crude oil and 

  

 3  

index to financial statements condensate revenues increased by 90 million or 11 over the prior year due primarily to an increase in crude oil prices somewhat offsetting the crude oil price increase was the decrease in crude oil production of approximately 19 in 2006 both of these increases were net of the effect of the loss of production due to the sale of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties at the end of the third quarter of 2006 in addition crude oil revenues for 2005 included an unrealized gain on crude oil derivatives of 55 million and there was no unrealized impact in 2006 brokered natural gas revenues decreased by 49 million due to a decrease in sales price partially offset by an increase in brokered volumes 

in 2006 energy commodity prices remained strong throughout the year our 2006 realized natural gas price was 713 per mcf six percent higher than the 2005 realized price of 674 our realized crude oil price was 6503 per bbl 47 higher than the 2005 realized price of 4419 these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments costless collars or swaps for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to the “results of operations” section in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the continued strength in the forward curve above historical levels and our receivable hedge position allowed us to pursue our largest organic capital program ever in 2006 this program included a significant level of drilling and investment in new leaseholds for the future while operating cash flow for the year did not cover this capital program the proceeds from the sale of assets allowed us to fund our investment plans we believe that as a result of the activity in 2006 we have the financial and operational flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 

on an equivalent basis our production level in 2006 increased by five percent from 2005 we produced 882 bcfe or 2417 mmcfe per day in 2006 as compared to 844 bcfe or 2311 mmcfe per day in 2005 natural gas production increased to 797 bcf in 2006 from 739 bcf in 2005 with increases in natural gas production occurring in all regions this growth primarily resulted from our 2005 and 2006 drilling programs which focused on projects in basins traditionally known for gas development highlights included the east region the minden field in the gulf coast and canada this natural gas production increase includes the effects of the divestiture of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties oil production decreased by 334 mbbls from 1739 mbbls in 2005 to 1405 mbbls in 2006 due primarily to a decrease in production in the gulf coast region resulting from the continued natural decline of the clf lease in south louisiana as well as the sale in september 2006 of this lease and other offshore and certain south louisiana properties 

a portion of our production was covered by oil and gas hedge instruments throughout 2006 again during 2006 as in 2005 we employed the use of collars to hedge our price exposure on our production for 2006 collars covered 34 of the natural gas production and had a weighted average floor of 825 per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of 1274 per mcf at december 31 2006 approximately 49 of the anticipated 2007 natural gas production is hedged with a weighted average floor of 899 per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of 1219 per mcf for 2006 collars covered 26 of the crude oil production with an average floor of 5000 per bbl and an average ceiling of 7600 per bbl at december 31 2006 approximately 47 of our anticipated crude oil production is hedged for 2007 with a weighted average floor of 6000 per bbl and a weighted average ceiling of 8000 per bbl as of december 31 2006 no derivatives are in place for 2008 our decision to hedge 2007 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows us to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production with greater volumes hedged for 2007 than in 2006 and hedged levels at higher prices the market would have to soften considerably for us not to match 2006 realized prices in 2007 

for the year ended december 31 2006 we drilled 387 gross wells with a success rate of 96 compared to 316 gross wells with a success rate of 95 for the prior year in 2007 we plan to drill approximately 440 gross wells 

our 2006 capital and exploration spending was 5375 million compared to 4256 million of total capital and exploration spending in 2005 total 2005 capital and exploration spending included 731 million primarily in the gulf coast to acquire proved producing properties we remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results and selectively pursuing impact exploration opportunities as we accelerate drilling on our accumulated acreage position in 2006 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions and we plan to continue to do so in 2007 for 2007 the east region will start the year with the largest allocation of capital followed by the gulf coast the west and canada this is the first time since 1997 that the gulf coast is not the leading capital allocation recipient we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term in 2007 we plan to spend approximately 434 million on capital and exploration activities

index to financial statements our proved reserves totaled approximately 1416 bcfe at december 31 2006 of which 97 was natural gas this reserve level was up by six percent from 1331 bcfe at december 31 2005 on the strength of results from our drilling program and the increase in our capital spending the reserve levels set forth below reflect the impact of approximately 68 bcfe of proved reserves at december 31 2005 associated with the offshore and certain south louisiana properties sold at the end of the third quarter of 2006 

the following table presents certain reserve production and well information as of december 31 2006 

 

  

  

 sale of properties 

on september 29 2006 we substantially completed the sale of our offshore portfolio and certain south louisiana properties to phoenix exploration company lp phoenix for a gross sales price of 3400 million the properties sold included proved reserves of approximately 98 bcfe as of the august 1 2006 effective date including 68 bcfe of proved reserves recorded as of december 31 2005 and had average daily production for the first nine months of 2006 of 474 mmcfe 

pursuant to the asset purchase agreement for the sale dated august 25 2006 the gross sales price was offset by the net cash flow from operation of the properties from august 1 2006 through the closing date and other purchase price adjustments the net proceeds from the sale were used to add funding to our capital program repurchase shares of common stock repay outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility and pay taxes related to the transaction also pursuant to the agreement we entered into certain commodity price swaps on behalf of phoenix at closing on september 29 2006 these derivative instruments were assigned to phoenix and we were released from all rights and obligations with respect thereto there was no ultimate impact on our financial statements due to the existence of these swaps 

through december 31 2006 the company had received approximately 3275 million in net proceeds from the sale which reflects the 3400 million gross sales price reduced by purchase price adjustments of 40 million as well as amounts attributable to consents and preferential rights expected to be settled in the first quarter of 2007 of 85 million a net gain of 2312 million 1445 million net of tax was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in 2006 and an additional gain of approximately 12 million is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2007 in connection with the closing of certain property sales to phoenix for which third party consents including deferred amounts had not been obtained as of december 31 2006 and sales to other parties that exercised their contractual preferential rights this gain will be subject to customary purchase price adjustments

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operated a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 2700 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2006 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the east region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

the principal markets for our east region natural gas are in the northeast united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system 

approximately 65 of our natural gas sales volume in the east region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one year or greater in addition spot market sales are made at indexbased prices under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately two percent of east production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2006 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor in 2005 we employed natural gas and crude oil price collars along with natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place at december 31 2006 we have natural gas and crude oil price collar arrangements in place for 2007 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

reserves 

current reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves at december 31 2006 

 

  

  

 the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum engineers miller and lents concluded the following in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues we used appropriate engineering geologic and evaluation principles in making our estimates and projections and our total proved reserves are reasonable for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those filed by us with other federal agencies during 2006 we filed estimates of our oil and gas reserves for the year 2005 with the department of energy these estimates differ by 5 percent or less from the reserve data presented our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of december 2006 if we had considered the impact of our hedging activities which were in a receivable position at december 31 2006 in our proved reserves there would not have been any significant effect

index to financial statements competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that in the east region our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming year and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources particularly in the west and gulf coast regions and canada 

other business matters 

major customer 

in 2006 no customer accounted for more than 10 of our total sales in each of 2005 and 2004 approximately 11 of our total sales were made to one customer 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas and the ferc has been directed to establish new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold the 2005 act also significantly increases the penalties for violations of the nga 

  

 15  

index to financial statements our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established interim rules governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates and has initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider whether to make those rules permanent the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 which reauthorizes the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposes enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines establishes increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and establishes a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections  in addition beginning in october 2005 the dot’s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration commenced a rulemaking proceeding to develop rules that would better distinguish onshore gathering lines from production facilities and transmission lines and to develop safety requirements better tailored to gathering line risks on march 15 2006 the dot revised its regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines we are not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of these new rules on our facilities or our business 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions 

  

 16  

index to financial statements and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in march 2006 to implement this required fiveyearly redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 13 percent should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2006 

another ferc proceeding that may impact our transportation costs relates to an ongoing proceeding to determine whether and to what extent pipelines should be permitted to include in their transportation rates an allowance for income taxes attributable to noncorporate partnership interests following a court remand the ferc has established a policy that a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity is entitled to a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or potential income tax liability” to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the ferc’s new policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

  

 17  

index to financial statements superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed 

oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act  the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had 374 active employees we recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we maintain with our employees overall we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory the company and its employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors tableend natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 

   

 19  

index to financial statements   

  

  

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

high demand for field services and equipment and the ability of suppliers to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our natural gas and oil properties 

due to current industry demands well service providers and related equipment and personnel are in short supply this may cause escalating prices delays in drilling and other exploration activities the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries such pressures would likely increase the actual cost of services extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to any accidents sustained from the over use of equipment and inexperienced personnel 

reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic engineering and production data as a result estimates of different engineers may vary in addition the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the degree of uncertainty varies among the four regions in which we operate the estimation of reserves for certain properties sold 

  

 20  

index to financial statements in 2006 as well as a small number of properties currently held in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than in canada and the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 

 

  

  

  

 results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 69 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

from time to time we may identify and evaluate opportunities to acquire natural gas and oil properties we may not be able to successfully consummate any acquisition to acquire producing natural gas and oil properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or to integrate the properties into our operations profitably 

  

 21  

index to financial statements we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas largely coastal waters which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2006 we owned or operated approximately 2900 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operator’s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator’s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 22  

index to financial statements our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours particularly in the rocky mountains midcontinent canada and gulf coast areas these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2006 we primarily employed natural gas and crude oil price collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor in addition we employed natural gas and crude oil price swap agreements during 2005 the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place 

these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 

  

  

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities 

  

 23  

index to financial statements integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan because of our stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our certificate of incorporation 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors’ duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 

  

  

  

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

west virginia royalty litigation 

in december 2001 we were sued by two royalty owners in west virginia state court for an unspecified amount of damages the plaintiffs have requested class certification and allege that we failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas that we had taken improper deductions from the royalty and that we failed to properly inform royalty owners of the deductions the plaintiffs also claimed that they are entitled to a 18th royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement that we reached with columbia gas transmission corporation in 1995 bankruptcy proceedings 

discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the state court have been ongoing the court entered an order on june 1 2005 granting the motion for class certification the parties have negotiated a modification to the order which will result in the dismissal of the claims related to the gas sales contract settlement in connection with the columbia gas transmission bankruptcy proceedings and that will limit the claims to those arising on and after december 17 1991 the court postponed the trial date from april 17 2006 in light of the case involving an unrelated party pending before the west virginia supreme court of appeals described below we intend to challenge the class certification order by filing a petition for writ of prohibition with the west virginia supreme court of appeals 

the west virginia supreme court of appeals issued a decision in 2006 in a case against another producer the tawney case that raised some of the same issues as are raised in our case this recent decision may negatively impact some of the defenses we have raised in our litigation with respect to the issue of deductibility of postproduction expenses under certain leases but we believe that in a significant number of leases we have lease language factual distinctions and defenses that are not implicated by the ruling 

the tawney case involves claims concerning the deductibility of postproduction expenses and the failure to properly inform issues shared with our case but also involves additional claims not raised in our case the most significant additional claims are related to sales under longterm fixedprice agreements at prices considered significantly below market value as well as claims for certain volume reductions and unmetered production the tawney case went to trial in january 2007 and the jury returned a verdict against the producer for 130 million in compensatory damages and 270 million in punitive damages judgment has not yet been entered in the tawney case and an appeal is expected we are closely monitoring developments in the tawney case and we continue to investigate how this recent ruling may impact our defense of our case the case against us has been reactivated to the docket and trial is set for august 13 2007 

we are vigorously defending the case a reserve has been established that management believes is adequate based on its estimate of the probable outcome of this case

index to financial statements texas title litigation 

on january 6 2003 we were served with plaintiffs second amended original petition in romeo longoria et al v exxon mobil corporation et al in the 79th judicial district court of brooks county texas plaintiffs filed their second supplemental original petition on november 12 2004 and their third supplemental original petition on february 22 2005 which added wynncrosby 1996 ltd and dominion oklahoma texas exploration  production inc plaintiffs filed their third amended original petition on february 21 2006 which incorporated all prior supplemental petitions plaintiffs allege that they are the owners of a onehalf undivided mineral interest in and to certain lands in brooks county texas cody energy llc our subsidiary acquired certain leases and wells in 1997 and 1998 

the plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in minerals and all improvements on the lands on which we acquired these leases the plaintiffs also assert claims for trespass to try title action to remove a cloud on the title failure to properly account for royalty fraud trespass and conversion all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages plaintiffs claim that they acquired title to the property by adverse possession plaintiffs also assert the discovery rule and a claim of fraudulent concealment to avoid the affirmative defense of limitations in august 2005 the case was abated until late february 2006 during which time the parties were allowed to amend pleadings or add additional parties to the litigation plaintiffs did not join additional parties by the abatement deadline defendants including us reurged our motion to dismiss and on april 5 2006 the court granted the motion dismissing the oil company defendants without prejudice because all defendants were not dismissed at that time the order dismissing us was not then final a motion to finalize the proceedings in the trial court via severance of the dismissed defendants was filed april 25 2006 and the remaining defendants moved to join the motions that led to the dismissal of us in 2006 the court dismissed the claims plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal although the record is not yet complete and therefore specific appellate deadlines have not been set we expect that following briefing and oral argument the appellate court will issue its decision by the end of 2007 or early 2008 

raymondville area 

in april 2004 our wholly owned subsidiary cody energy llc filed suit in state court in willacy county texas against certain of our coworking interest owners in the raymondville area located in kenedy and willacy counties in early 2003 we had proposed a new prospect under the terms of the joint operating agreement some of the coworking interest owners elected not to participate the initial well was successful and subsequent wells have been drilled to exploit the discovery made in the first well 

the working interest owners who elected not to participate notified us that they believed that they had the right to participate in wells drilled after the initial well we contend that the working interest owners that elected not to participate are required to assign their interest in the prospect to those who elected to participate the defendants filed a counter claim against us and one of the defendants filed a lien against our interest in the leases in the raymondville area 

we have signed a settlement agreement with certain of the defendants representing approximately three percent of the interest in the area cody and the remaining defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment in august 2005 the trial judge entered an order granting our motion for summary judgment requiring the remaining defendant to assign to us all of its interest in the prospect and to remove the lien filed against our interest 

on july 12 2006 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire all of the defendant’s interest in the raymondville field the agreement would make the summary judgment ruling by the trial judge a final order dismiss with prejudice all pending counter claims filed by such defendant and remove the lien against our properties filed by such defendant we completed the acquisition in the third quarter of 2006 the lien has been removed the summary judgment has become a final order and all of the defendant’s claims have been dismissed

index to financial statements commitment and contingency reserves 

we have established reserves for certain legal proceedings the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately 91 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

while the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow operating results however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively within the united states and canada 

overview 

cabot oil  gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

at cabot there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital drilling opportunities acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time at any one time one or more of these may not be economically feasible 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2005 and 2006 the futures market reported strong natural gas and crude oil contract prices our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 713 per mcf and 6503 per bbl respectively in 2006 these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments in an effort to manage commodity price risk we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars these financial instruments are an important element of our risk management strategy and assisted in the increase in our realized natural gas price from 2005 to 2006 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see “risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business” and “risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable” in item 1a

index to financial statements the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2005 and 2006 “index” represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2005” and “2006” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements as applicable 

 

 prices for crude oil have continued to maintain strength in 2005 and rose further in 2006 the tables below contain the nymex monthly average crude oil price index and our realized per barrel bbl crude oil prices by month for 2005 and 2006 the “2005” and “2006” price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements 

 

 we reported earnings of 664 per share or 3212 million for 2006 this is up from the 304 per share or 1484 million reported in 2005 earnings increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the 2312 million 1445 million net of tax gain recorded in 2006 related to the sale of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties in addition the stronger price environment favorable natural gas hedge settlements and increased natural gas production were primary contributors to the earnings increase due to the increase in natural gas and oil revenues prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments rose six percent for natural gas and 47 for oil 

we drilled 387 gross wells with a success rate of 96 in 2006 compared to 316 gross wells with a 95 success rate in 2005 total capital and exploration expenditures increased by 1119 million to 5375 million in 2006 of which 67 million was for property acquisitions compared to 4256 million in 2005 of which 731 million was for property acquisitions we believe our operating cash flow in 2007 will be sufficient to fund a substantial portion of our budgeted capital and exploration spending of approximately 434 million with minimal borrowings from our credit facility 

our 2007 strategy will remain consistent with 2006 we will remain focused on our strategies of pursuing lower risk drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results and selectively pursuing impact exploration opportunities as we accelerate drilling on our accumulated acreage position in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary sources of cash in 2006 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production and proceeds from the sale of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties and to a lesser extent proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock plans we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years working capital is also substantially influenced by these variables during 2005 approximately 14 bcfe of expected production in our gulf coast region was deferred due to the impacts of hurricanes katrina and rita these hurricanes did not have a material adverse impact on our capital resources nor liquidity fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see “results of operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures and to pay dividends proceeds from the disposition of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties were used to fund additional capital expenditures reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to purchase treasury stock proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans and the tax benefit of stock based compensation during 2006 partially offset our repurchase of 1088500 treasury shares of common stock at a weighted average purchase price of 4271 see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

 

 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 decreased by 75 million over 2005 this decrease was primarily due to an increase in current income tax expense related to the sale of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties partially offset by an increase in earnings and an increase in working capital changes other factors impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased six percent over 2005 while crude oil realized prices increased 47 over the same period equivalent production increased by five percent in 2006 compared to 2005 while we believe 2007 commodity production may exceed 2006 levels we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased 915 million over 2004 this increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices key components impacting net operating cash flows were commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased 30 over 2004 while crude oil realized prices increased 40 over the same period production volumes declined slightly with a less than one percent reduction of equivalent production in 2005 compared to 2004 see “results of operations” for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

investing activities the primary uses of cash in investing activities were capital spending and exploration expenses we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices due to the volatility of commodity prices our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 2248 million from 2005 to 2006 and increased by 1568 million from 2004 to 2005 cash flows used in investments in capital and exploration expenditures were 5168 million in 2006 compared to 4131 million used in 2005 in response to higher commodity prices this increase of 1037 million in investments in capital and exploration expenses was entirely offset by the increase of 3285 million in proceeds from the sale of assets primarily as a result of the sale of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties 

the increase from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the east region and the rocky mountains area of our west region in response to higher commodity prices our continued drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase in addition we spent 731 million in proved property acquisitions primarily in the gulf coast 

  

 33  

index to financial statements financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were 1385 million for 2006 and were comprised of payments made to decrease outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility to purchase treasury stock and to pay dividends partially offsetting these cash uses were inflows from the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit received from stockbased compensation cash flows provided by financing activities were 482 million for 2005 resulting from borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments cash flows used in financing activities for 2004 were 84 million resulting from proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments 

at december 31 2006 we had 10 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility the credit facility provides for an available credit line of 250 million which can be expanded up to 350 million either with the existing banks or new banks the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer and other assets the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december 2009 we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings if necessary our capital requirements including potential acquisitions 

in august 1998 we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions as a result of the 3for2 stock split effected in march 2005 this figure was adjusted to three million shares in october 2006 we announced that our board of directors increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for repurchase by an additional two million shares for a total of five million shares during 2006 we repurchased 1088500 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 4271 all purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions there is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase our securities the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of december 31 2006 was 2397650 see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

  

 for the year ended december 31 2006 we paid dividends of 78 million on our common stock a regular dividend of 004 per share of common stock or 0027 per share for dividends prior to the 3for2 stock split as adjusted for the split has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990 

  

 34  

index to financial statements increase in authorized shares 

on may 4 2006 our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 80 million to 120 million shares we correspondingly increased the number of shares of series a junior participating preferred stock reserved for issuance from 800000 to 1200000 the shares of series a junior participating preferred stock are issuable pursuant to our rights agreement with the bank of new york as rights agent 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2006 

 

 we plan to drill approximately 440 gross wells in 2007 compared with 387 gross wells drilled in 2006 this 2007 drilling program includes approximately 434 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 5375 million in 2006 we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization dda rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period in 2007 management expects an increase in our dda rate due to higher capital costs partially as a result of inflationary cost pressures in the industry over the last three years and downward reserve revisions this change is currently estimated to be approximately 15 greater than 2006 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

contractual obligations 

our known material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 

during 2006 we assisted certain nonexecutive employees in obtaining loans to purchase interests offered under our mineral royalty and overriding royalty interest plan by providing a guarantee of repayment should the nonexecutive employee fail to repay the loan the repayment term for all of these loans is five years all loans are collateralized by the interests transferred to the employees in the producing properties the outstanding loan balances are approximately 03 million in the aggregate and the fair value of these guarantees are immaterial to our financial statements 

  

 35  

index to financial statements a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 are set forth in the following table 

 

  

  

  

 amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2006 was 227 million down from 430 million at december 31 2005 primarily due to the sale of the offshore and certain south louisiana properties during the end of the third quarter of 2006 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the most significant policies are discussed below 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the degree of uncertainty varies among the four regions in which we operate the estimation of reserves for certain properties sold in 2006 as well as a small number of properties currently held in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than in canada and the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 

 

  

  

  

   

 36  

index to financial statements since 1990 100 of our reserves have been reviewed by miller  lents ltd an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the “supplemental oil and gas information” 

our rate of recording dda expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves which is utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 005 to 006 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 001 impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our dda rate 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a leasebylease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows in 2006 2005 and 2004 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 21 million or decrease by approximately 20 million respectively per year 

in the past the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions average property lives in the east gulf coast and west regions have been six three and seven years respectively average property lives in canada are estimated to be four years as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 133 under sfas no 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other 

  

 37  

index to financial statements comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective under sfas no 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate in the consolidated statement of operations 

longterm employee benefit costs 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of highquality fixed income securities in order to select the discount rate we use benchmarks such as the moody’s aa corporate rate which was 58 annualized for 2006 and the citigroup pension liability index which was 59 at the end of 2006 we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 575 at december 31 2006 is reasonable 

in order to value our pension liabilities we use the rp2000 combined mortality table this is a widely accepted table used for valuing pension liabilities this table represents a more recent and conservative mortality table than the 1983 group annuity mortality table and appears to be an appropriate table based on the demographics of our benefit plans another consideration that is made is a salary scale selection we have assumed that salaries will increase four percent based on our expectation of future salary increases 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2006 the assumed rate of increase was 80 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan we attempt to maximize return over the longterm subject to appropriate levels of risk one of our plan objectives is that the performance of the equity portion of the pension plan exceed the standard and poors’ 500 index by a minimum of two percent annually over the long term we also seek to achieve a minimum five percent annual real rate of return above the rate of inflation on the total portfolio over the longterm in our pension calculations we have used eight percent as the expected longterm return on plan assets for 2006 2005 and 2004 a monte carlo simulation was run using 5000 simulations based upon our actual asset allocation and liability duration which has been determined to be approximately 16 years this model uses historical data for the period of 19262003 for stocks bonds and cash to determine the best estimate range of future returns the median rate of return or return that we expect to achieve over 50 percent of the time is approximately nine percent we expect to achieve a minimum 64 annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term at least 75 percent of the time in addition the actual rate of return on plan assets annualized over the past ten years is approximately six percent we believe that the eight percent chosen is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results

stockbased compensation 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the accounting policies described in sfas no 123r “share based payment revised 2004” we chose to use the modified prospective method of transition and accordingly no adjustments to prior period financial statements were made prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stockbased compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” under this method we recognized compensation cost as the excess if any of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock in addition sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” outlines a fair value based method of accounting for stock options or similar equity instruments under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used 

one primary difference in our method of accounting after the adoption of sfas no 123r is that unvested stock options are now expensed as a component of stockbased compensation cost in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations this expense is based on the fair value of the award at the original grant date and is recognized over the vesting period prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we included this amount as a proforma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the expense resulting from the expensing of stock options was 03 million for the year ended december 31 2006 another change relates to the accounting for our performance share awards certain of these awards are now accounted for by bifurcating the equity and liability components a monte carlo model is used to value the liability component rather than accounting for the award using the average closing stock price at the end of each reporting period all other awards are accounted for in substantially the same way as they were or would have been in prior periods with the exception of the differences noted below 

other differences in the way we account for stockbased compensation after january 1 2006 result from the application of a forfeiture rate to all grants rather than recording actual forfeitures as they occur we are now required to estimate forfeitures on all equitybased compensation and adjust periodic expense upon adoption we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment for these forfeitures as the amount was immaterial in addition this change in accounting for forfeitures resulted in an immaterial change in overall compensation cost for the year ended december 31 2006 furthermore we are required to expense certain awards to retirementeligible employees in the month an employee becomes retirement eligible depending on the structure of each individual plan the retirementeligibility provision only applies to new grants that were awarded after january 1 2006 the total expense that we recognized related to restricted stock awards granted to retirementeligible employees in 2006 was 06 million 

we issued stock appreciation rights to executive employees for the first time during the first quarter of 2006 the grant date fair value of these awards is measured using a blackscholes model and compensation cost is expensed over the three year gradedvesting service period expense related to these awards was 10 million before the effect of taxes for 2006 in addition a new type of performance share was issued to nonexecutive employees these awards measure our performance based on three internal metrics rather than a peer group’s stock performance which we use to measure our other performance share awards these awards cliff vest at the end of the three year service period compensation cost related to these new internalmetric based performance share awards granted to

index to financial statements employees was 14 million before the effect of taxes for 2006 in addition we incurred a 06 million 04 million net of tax cumulative effect charge in the first quarter of 2006 which is included within general and administrative expenses due to its immateriality as a result of changes made in our accounting for performance shares for further information on the accounting for these and our other stockbased compensation awards please refer to notes 1 and 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

during the third quarter of 2006 we adopted the provisions outlined under fasb staff position fsp fas no 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards” which discusses accounting for taxes for stock awards using the apic pool concept we made a one time election as prescribed under the fsp to use the shortcut approach to derive the initial windfall tax benefit pool we chose to use a onepool approach which combines all awards granted to employees including nonemployee directors 

our compensation committee of our board of directors made one modification to our stock option awards in 2005 it approved the acceleration to december 15 2005 of the vesting of 198799 unvested stock options awarded in february 2003 under our second amended and restated 1994 longterm incentive plan and 24500 unvested stock options awarded in april 2004 under our 2004 incentive plan 

the 198799 shares awarded to employees under the 1994 plan at an exercise price of 1532 would have vested in february 2006 the 24500 shares awarded to nonemployee directors under the 2004 plan at an exercise price of 2332 would have vested 12250 shares in each of april 2006 and april 2007 the decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options which we believed to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative burden associated with our adoption of sfas no 123r the accelerated vesting of the options did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for 2005 the acceleration of vesting reduced our compensation expense related to these options by approximately 02 million for 2006 

other issues and contingencies 

corporate income tax  we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions for corporations other than integrated oil companies the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference cannot reduce a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production” “natural gas marketing gathering and transportation” “federal regulation of petroleum” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 “business” for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the companys various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at december 31 2006 we are in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in “capital resources and liquidity”

index to financial statements operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see “risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collars and in previous years swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instrumentsan amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” sfas no 155 amends sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” and also resolves issues addressed in sfas no 133 implementation issue no d1 “application of statement 133 to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets” sfas no 155 was issued to eliminate the exemption from applying sfas no 133 to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for in a similar fashion regardless of the instrument’s form we do not believe that our financial position results of operations or cash flows will be impacted by sfas no 155 as we do not currently hold any hybrid financial instruments 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin no 48 provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions as defined in sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin no 48 prescribes a twostep process for accounting for income tax uncertainties first a threshold condition of “more likely than not” should be met to determine whether any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position should be recognized in the financial statements if the recognition threshold is met fin no 48 provides additional guidance on measuring the amount of the uncertain tax position guidance is also provided regarding derecognition classification interest and penalties interim period accounting transition and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions fin no 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are completing our evaluation of the impact of the adoption of fin no 48 and believe that the impact will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which establishes a formal framework for measuring fair values of assets and liabilities in financial statements that are already required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be measured at fair value sfas no 157 clarifies guidance in 

  

 41  

index to financial statements fasb concepts statement con no 7 which discusses present value techniques in measuring fair value additional disclosures are also required for transactions measured at fair value no new fair value measurements are prescribed and sfas no 157 is intended to codify the several definitions of fair value included in various accounting standards however the application of this statement may change current practices for certain companies sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating what impact sfas no 157 may have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet and the recognition through other comprehensive income of gains losses prior service costs and credits net of tax arising during the period but not included as a component of periodic benefit cost in addition the measurement date of plan assets and obligations must be as of a company’s balance sheet date additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements are required and guidance is prescribed regarding the selection of discount rates to be used in measuring the benefit obligation for public companies the effective date of sfas no 158 is as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december 15 2006 the effective date of the new measurement date provision is for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 however our measurement date is currently our balance sheet date so no change will be required the incremental effect of sfas no 158 as discussed in note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements was an increase to total longterm liabilities of 217 million an increase to current liabilities of 06 million an increase to total assets of 82 million and a decrease to total stockholders’ equity of 141 million based on actuarial reports as of december 31 2006 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” in an effort to address diversity in the accounting practice of quantifying misstatements and the potential for improper amounts on the balance sheet prior to the issuance of sab no 108 the two methods used for quantifying the effects of financial statement errors were the “rollover” and “iron curtain” methods under the “rollover” method the primary focus is the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements the criticism of this method is that misstatements can accumulate on the balance sheet on the other hand the “iron curtain” method focuses on the effect of correcting the ending balance sheet with less importance on the reversing effects of prior year errors in the income statement sab no 108 establishes a “dual approach” which requires the quantification of the effect of financial statement errors on each financial statement as well as related disclosures public companies are required to record the cumulative effect of initially adopting the “dual approach” method in the first year ending after november 16 2006 by recording any necessary corrections to asset and liability balances with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings the use of this cumulative effect transition method also requires detailed disclosures of the nature and amount of each error being corrected and how and when they arose we have adopted the provisions of sab no 108 and there was no impact to our financial position results of operations and cash flows as a result of this pronouncement

index to financial statements natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price for 2006 including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 713 per mcf compared to 674 per mcf for the prior year these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which increased these prices by 035 per mcf in 2006 and reduced these prices by 133 per mcf in 2005 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2005 there was no unrealized impact from the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2006 these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in natural gas production revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

 the increase in natural gas production revenue is due to the increase in natural gas sales production and to a lesser extent the increase in realized natural gas prices production increased in all regions and prices were up in the gulf coast and west the increase in the total realized natural gas price and production resulted in a net revenue increase of 700 million excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments this growth primarily resulted from our 2005 and 2006 drilling programs which focused on projects in basins traditionally known for gas development including the east region the minden field in the gulf coast and canada this natural gas production increase includes the effects of the divestiture of our offshore and certain south louisiana properties for the year ended december 31 2006 natural gas volumes from the properties sold in the third quarter 2006 disposition were 9037 mmcf and natural gas revenues from those properties were approximately 705 million

 the decreased brokered natural gas margin of 11 million was driven by a decrease in sales price that outpaced the decrease in purchase cost offset in part by an increase in volume

index to financial statements crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price for 2006 was 6503 per bbl there was no realized impact of crude oil derivative instruments in 2006 our average total company realized crude oil sales price was 4419 per bbl for 2005 including the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced the price by 993 per bbl the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 55 million for the year ended december 31 2005 there was no unrealized impact from the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2006 these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in crude oil and condensate revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

 the increase in the realized crude oil price offset by the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 145 million excluding the unrealized impact of derivative instruments the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of decreased gulf coast production from the sale of properties in the third quarter of 2006 and the continued natural decline of the clf lease in south louisiana which was part of the sale for the year ended december 31 2006 crude oil and condensate volumes from the properties sold in the third quarter disposition were 707 mbbl and crude oil and condensate revenues from those properties were approximately 474 million

index to financial statements impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 

other operating revenues 

other operating revenues increased by 62 million from 2005 to 2006 this change was primarily a result of an increase in revenues from net profits interest that originated in 2006 as well as a decrease in our payout liability associated with a favorable legal ruling in the first quarter of 2006 which correspondingly increased other revenues and favorable settlements of state severance tax audits this variance also results to a lesser extent from changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous year period 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased by 410 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the primary reasons for this fluctuation were as follows

index to financial statements   

 interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased by 34 million due to lower borrowings on our 719 fixed rate debt and increased interest on our short term investments as well as the commencement of regulatory interest capitalization on our pipeline in the east region offset partially by higher average credit facility borrowings as well as an increasing interest rate environment weighted average borrowings based on daily balances were approximately 61 million during 2006 compared to 32 million during 2005 in addition the weighted average effective interest rate on the credit facility increased to 79 during 2006 from 69 during the prior year 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased by 1015 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax income primarily as a result of the gain on the sale of assets recorded in the third quarter of 2006 the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 371 and 372 respectively 

2005 and 2004 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2005 of 1484 million or 304 per share during 2004 we reported net income of 884 million or 181 per share operating income increased by 980 million compared to the prior year from 1607 million to 2587 million the increase in operating income from 2004 to 2005 was principally due to an increase in natural gas and oil production revenues partially offset by an increase in total operating expenses net income increased from 2004 to 2005 by 600 million due to an increase in operating income partially offset by an increase of 376 million in income tax expense

index to financial statements natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 674 per mcf compared to 520 per mcf for the comparable period of the prior year these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 133 per mcf in 2005 and 076 per mcf in 2004 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 11 million and 09 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in natural gas production revenues in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

 the increase in natural gas production revenue is due substantially to the increase in natural gas sales prices in addition the slight increase in production was due to the successful drilling programs in the east west and canada partially offsetting this was the decrease in the gulf coast production the increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the increase in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 1193 million

 the increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 139 million the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of the decrease in the gulf coast region production due to the continued natural decline of the clf lease in south louisiana as well as the impact of hurricanes which included the shutting in and deferring of production at the breton sound offshore lease one of our largest areas of offshore oil production

other operating revenues 

other operating revenues decreased 36 million this change was primarily a result of an increase in our payout liability associated with the reduction of our interest due to customary reversionary interest owned by others which correspondingly decreased other operating revenues in addition our revenues from net profits interest declined over the prior year this revenue variance also results to a lesser extent from changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous year 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased 545 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production under our revolving credit agreement the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100 of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges at december 31 2006 we had 20 cash flow hedges open 19 natural gas price collar arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement at december 31 2006 an 820 million 512 million net of tax unrealized gain was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income along with an 820 million shortterm derivative receivable the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate 

assuming no change in commodity prices after december 31 2006 we would expect to reclassify to the consolidated statement of operations over the next 12 months 512 million in aftertax income associated with commodity hedges this reclassification represents the net shortterm receivable associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december 31 2006 related to anticipated 2007 production

index to financial statements hedges on production  options 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us during 2006 natural gas price collars covered 27179 mmcf of our gas production or 34 of our gas production with a weighted average floor of 825 per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of 1274 per mcf during 2006 an oil price collar covered 365 mbbl of our crude oil production or 26 of our crude oil production with an average floor of 5000 per mbbl and an average ceiling of 7600 per mbbl 

at december 31 2006 we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our 2007 production as follows 

 

 at december 31 2006 we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering our 2007 production as follows 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

overview 

cabot oil  gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration development acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties located in north america the five principal areas of operation are appalachian basin rocky mountains anadarko basin onshore and offshore the texas and louisiana gulf coast and the gas basin of western canada operationally we have four regional offices located in houston texas charleston west virginia denver colorado and calgary alberta 

net income for 2005 of 1484 million or 304 per share exceeded the prior year’s net income of 884 million or 181 per share by 600 million or 123 per share the per share data for 2004 has been adjusted for the 3for2 split of our stock that occurred in march 2005 the yearoveryear net income increase was achieved due to higher natural gas and crude oil production revenues primarily as a result of higher commodity prices partially offset by higher operating expenses and taxes operating revenues increased by 1524 million or 29 due to strong commodity prices natural gas production revenues increased by 1195 million over the prior year crude oil and condensate revenues and brokered natural gas revenues also increased by 142 million and 223 million respectively partially offsetting these increased revenues operating expenses increased by 545 million between 2005 and 2004 this increase was principally due to increased exploration costs brokered natural gas costs and taxes other than income net income in 2005 was also reduced by an increase in income tax expense of 376 million at december 31 2005 our debttototalcapital ratio was 36 down slightly from 37 at the end of 2004 

natural gas production increased to 739 bcf in 2005 from 728 bcf in 2004 this growth resulted from our 2004 and 2005 drilling programs which focused on natural gas projects especially in the east on an equivalent basis our production level in 2005 was down slightly from 2004 we produced 844 bcfe or 2311 mmcfe per day in 2005 as compared to 848 bcfe or 2323 mmcfe per day in 2004 the growth in natural gas production was offset by the natural decline in oil production in south louisiana as well as the impact of the hurricanes which included the shutting in and deferring of production at the breton sound offshore lease one of our largest areas of offshore oil production 

in 2005 energy commodity prices remained strong throughout the year our 2005 realized natural gas price was 674 per mcf compared to a 2004 price of 520 our realized crude oil price was 4419 per bbl compared to a 2004 price of 3155 these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments this strong price environment allowed us to pursue our largest organic capital program ever while still maintaining our financial flexibility in the current year this flexibility allowed us the ability to acquire additional interests in two fields in the gulf coast we believe that as a result of our strong capital program and financial flexibility we should be able to continue to take advantage of additional attractive acquisition opportunities that may arise 

a portion of our production was covered by oil and gas hedge instruments throughout 2005 to cover production in 2005 and 2006 at december 31 2005 33 and 26 of our natural gas and crude oil anticipated production respectively are hedged for 2006 through the use of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as of december 31 2005 no derivatives are in place for 2007 our decision to hedge 2006 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows us to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production our average hedged prices on natural gas and crude oil for 2006 anticipated production are expected to be higher than comparable prices realized in 2005 

for the year ended december 31 2005 we drilled 316 gross wells with a success rate of 95 compared to 256 gross wells with a success rate of 95 for the prior year in 2006 we plan to drill approximately 391 gross wells 

our proved reserves totaled approximately 1331 bcfe at december 31 2005 of which 95 was natural gas this reserve level was up by 11 from 1202 bcfe at december 31 2004 on the strength of results from our drilling program and the increase in our capital spending 

  

our 2005 capital and exploration spending was 4256 million including 731 million primarily in the gulf coast to acquire proved producing properties compared to 2595 million of total capital and exploration spending in 2004 we remain focused on our strategies of balancing our capital investments between acceptable risk and strongest economics along with balancing longer life investments with impact exploration opportunities in the past we have used a portion of the cash flow from our longlived east and midcontinent natural gas reserves to fund our exploration and development efforts in the gulf coast and rocky mountains areas we have continued that practice and the allocation of capital among regions in 2005 was similar in percentage to the allocation in 2004 with the gulf coast region being allocated an additional 12 in capital over the previous year in 2006 we plan to spend approximately 396 million which includes a layer of investment for new projects or property acquisitions that may arise during the year 

in march 2005 we completed a 3for2 split of our common stock in the form of a stock distribution all common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 3for2 split of our common stock 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information see “forwardlooking information” for further details 

the following table presents certain reserve production and well information as of december 31 2005 

 

   east region 

our east activities are concentrated primarily in west virginia in this region our assets include a large acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity capital and exploration expenditures were 990 million or 23 of our total 2005 capital spending and 752 million or 29 of our total 2004 capital spending for 2006 we have budgeted 1161 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

at december 31 2005 we had 2745 wells 25502 net of which 2657 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include the big lime weir berea and devonian shale formations at depths primarily ranging from 1000 to 9500 feet average net daily production in 2005 was 592 mmcfe while natural gas production volumes from east reservoirs are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states the productive life of east reserves is relatively long at december 31 2005 we had 6374 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the east region constituting 48 of our total proved reserves this region is managed from our office in charleston west virginia 

  

in 2005 we drilled 185 wells 1798 net in the east region of which 182 wells 1768 net were development and extension wells in 2006 we plan to drill approximately 239 wells 

in 2005 we produced and marketed approximately 70 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the east region at market responsive prices 

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2005 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the east region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

the principal markets for our east region natural gas are in the northeast united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system 

approximately 65 of our natural gas sales volume in the east region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one year or greater in addition spot market sales are made under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately 2 of east production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually 

west region

activities in the rocky mountains are concentrated in the green river washakie and big horn basins in wyoming and paradox basin in colorado at december 31 2005 we had 2412 bcfe of proved reserves 95 natural gas in the rocky mountains area or 18 of our total proved reserves capital and exploration expenditures in the rocky mountains were 454 million for 2005 or 11 of our total capital and exploration expenditures and 415 million for 2004 for 2006 we have budgeted 578 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area 

  

we had 576 wells 2524 net in the rocky mountains area as of december 31 2005 of which 295 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in the rocky mountains area are in the almond frontier dakota and honaker trail formations at depths ranging from 5500 to 15000 feet average net daily production in the rocky mountains during 2005 was 373 mmcfe 

in 2005 we drilled 49 wells 161 net in the rocky mountains of which 45 wells 133 net were development wells in 2006 we plan to drill 42 wells 

midcontinent 

our midcontinent activities are concentrated in the anadarko basin in southwest kansas oklahoma and the panhandle of texas capital and exploration expenditures were 237 million for 2005 or 6 of our total 2005 capital and exploration expenditures and 121 million for 2004 for 2006 we have budgeted 331 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area 

as of december 31 2005 we had 680 wells 4718 net in the midcontinent area of which 523 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in the midcontinent are in the chase morrow red fork and chester formations at depths ranging from 2200 to 10000 feet average net daily production in 2005 was 291 mmcfe at december 31 2005 we had 1911 bcfe of proved reserves 97 natural gas in the midcontinent area or 14 of our total proved reserves 

in 2005 we drilled 34 wells 215 net in the midcontinent all of which were development and extension wells in 2006 we plan to drill 42 wells 

our principal markets for west region natural gas are in the northwest and midwest united states we sell natural gas to power generators natural gas processors local distribution companies industrial customers and marketing companies currently approximately 75 of our natural gas production in the west region is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one to three years at indexbased prices another 23 of the natural gas production is sold under shortterm arrangements at indexbased prices and the remaining 2 is sold under certain fixedprice contracts the west region properties are connected to the majority of the midwest and northwest interstate and intrastate pipelines affording us access to multiple markets 

in 2005 we produced and marketed approximately 450 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the west region at market responsive prices 

gulf coast region 

our exploration development and production activities in the gulf coast region are primarily concentrated in north and south louisiana south texas and to a lesser extent the gulf of mexico a regional office in houston manages the operations principal producing intervals are in the cotton valley hosston miocene and frio age formations in louisiana and the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in texas at depths ranging from 3000 to 25000 feet capital and exploration expenditures were 2335 million for 2005 or 55 of our total capital and exploration expenditures and 1126 million for 2004 during 2005 we spent 721 million on proved property acquisitions for 2006 we have budgeted 1544 million of our total budget for capital and exploration expenditures in the region our 2006 gulf coast drilling program will emphasize activity in our focus areas of east texas north louisiana and south texas 

in 2005 we drilled 39 wells 262 net in the gulf coast region of which 23 wells 174 net were development wells in 2006 we plan to drill 55 wells we had 788 wells 5157 net in the gulf coast region as of december 31 2005 of which 582 wells are operated by us average daily production in 2005 was 1021 mmcfe compared to 1153 mmcfe in 2004 the decline is the result of lower production from our properties in south louisiana offset partially by increased production from the coastal texas area at december 31 2005 we had 2409 bcfe of proved reserves 80 natural gas in the gulf coast region which represented 18 of our total proved reserves 

  

our principal markets for gulf coast region natural gas are in the industrialized gulf coast area and the northeast united states we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies currently approximately 50 of our natural gas sales volumes in the gulf coast region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one to three years the remaining 50 of our sales volumes are sold at indexbased prices under shortterm agreements the gulf coast properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

in 2005 we produced and marketed approximately 4100 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the gulf coast region at market responsive prices 

canada region 

our activities in the canada region are managed by a regional office in calgary alberta our canadian exploration development and producing activities are concentrated in the provinces of alberta and british columbia at december 31 2005 we had 203 bcfe of proved reserves 97 natural gas in the canada region constituting 2 of our total proved reserves 

capital and exploration expenditures in canada were 229 million for 2005 or 5 of our total capital and exploration expenditures and 162 million for 2004 for 2006 we have budgeted 307 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area 

we had 20 wells 39 net in the canada region as of december 31 2005 of which 8 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in the canada region are in the falher bluesky cadomin and the swan hills formations at depths ranging from 9500 to 16000 feet average net daily production in canada during 2005 was 34 mmcfe 

in 2005 we drilled 9 wells 35 net in canada of which 5 wells 17 net were development and extension wells in 2006 we plan to drill 13 wells 

in 2005 we produced and marketed approximately 50 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the canada region at market responsive prices 

risk management 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2005 we primarily employed natural gas and crude oil price swap and collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor 

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

  

reserves 

current reserves 

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves at december 31 2005 

 

   the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum engineers miller and lents concluded the following in their judgment 1 we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues 2 we used appropriate engineering geologic and evaluation principles in making our estimates and projections and 3 our total proved reserves are reasonable for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those filed by us with other federal agencies during 2005 we filed estimates of our oil and gas reserves for the year 2004 with the department of energy these estimates differ by 5 percent or less from the reserve data presented our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of december 2005 if we had considered the impact of our hedging activities in our proved reserves there would not have been any significant effect 

for additional information about the risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see “risk factors—reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated” in item 1a

well summary 

the following table presents our ownership at december 31 2005 in productive natural gas and oil wells in the east region consisting of various fields located in west virginia virginia and ohio in the west region consisting of various fields located in oklahoma kansas colorado and wyoming in the gulf coast region consisting primarily of various fields located in louisiana and texas and in the canada region consisting of various fields located in the provinces of alberta and british columbia this summary includes natural gas and oil wells in which we have a working interest 

 

  drilling activity 

we drilled wells participated in the drilling of wells or acquired wells as indicated in the region table below 

 

   

competition 

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery records affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers in the east region who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources particularly in the west and gulf coast regions and canada 

other business matters 

major customer 

in each of 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 11 of our total sales were made to one customer 

seasonality 

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas and the ferc has been directed to establish new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through among other things expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold the 2005 act also significantly increases the penalties for violations of the nga 

  

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also developed rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates and implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter in addition beginning in early 2006 the dot’s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration commenced a rulemaking proceeding to develop rules that would better distinguish onshore gathering lines from production facilities and transmission lines and to develop safety requirements better tailored to gathering line risks we are not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of this rulemaking proposal 

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

federal regulation of petroleum 

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the second of these required reviews commenced in july 2005 where the ferc proposed to continue use of the indexing methodology for a further five year period 

another ferc proceeding that may impact our transportation costs relates to an ongoing proceeding to determine whether and to what extent pipelines should be permitted to include in their transportation rates an allowance for 

  

income taxes attributable to noncorporate partnership interests following a court remand the ferc has established a policy that a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity is entitled to a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an “actual or potential income tax liability” to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income 

we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or the final outcome of the application of the ferc’s new policy on income tax allowances 

environmental regulations 

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

outer continental shelf lands act  the federal outer continental shelf lands act ocsla and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto impose a variety of regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees permit holders and other parties operating on the outer continental shelf specific design and operational standards may apply to outer continental shelf vessels rigs platforms vehicles and structures violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution we believe that we substantially comply with the ocsla and its regulations 

solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner 

  

and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed 

oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

clean water act  the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 cabot oil  gas had 354 active employees we recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we maintain with our employees overall we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory the company and its employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations 

drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity 

our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including 

 

  

  

   

  

 our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil 

reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 

reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic engineering and production data as a result estimates of different engineers may vary in addition the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate the estimation of reserves in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 

 

  

  

  

 results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original 

  

estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 69 may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 

our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable 

in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop economically lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures 

exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 

we are continually identifying and evaluating opportunities to acquire natural gas and oil properties we may not be able to successfully consummate any acquisition to acquire producing natural gas and oil properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or to integrate the properties into our operations profitably 

we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses 

our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 

  

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2005 we owned or operated approximately 3400 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance 

in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 

other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operator’s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator’s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 

the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 

the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 

competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position 

competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours particularly in the rocky mountains midcontinent and gulf coast areas these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 

  

we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil 

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2005 we primarily employed natural gas and crude oil price swap and collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor 

these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when 

 

  

  

 we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 and “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate 

our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed 

we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business 

our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including tax laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities 

  

provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment 

our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and limit stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan because of our stockholder rights plan and these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 

the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our certificate of incorporation 

the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors’ duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability 

 

  

  

  

 this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a defendant in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business all known liabilities are accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss while the outcome and impact of such legal proceedings on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow operating results however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved 

wyoming royalty litigation 

in january 2002 we were sued by 13 overriding royalty owners in wyoming federal district court as reported in previous filings the plaintiffs made claims pertaining to deductions from their overriding royalty and claims concerning penalties for improper reporting as a result of several decisions by the court favorable to us the case was settled in september 2005 with no payment from us and a dismissal with prejudice of all claims by plaintiffs the settlement included provisions for reporting and payment going forward in the third quarter of 2005 management reversed the reserve we had recorded regarding this case which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

west virginia royalty litigation 

in december 2001 we were sued by two royalty owners in west virginia state court for an unspecified amount of damages the plaintiffs have requested class certification and allege that we failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas that we had taken improper deductions from the royalty and failed to properly inform royalty owners of the deductions the plaintiffs also claimed that they are entitled to a 18th royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement that we reached with columbia gas transmission corporation in 1995 bankruptcy proceedings 

discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the state court have been ongoing the court entered an order on june 1 2005 granting the motion for class certification the parties have negotiated a modification to the order which will result in the dismissal of the claims related to the gas sales contract settlement in connection with the columbia gas transmission bankruptcy proceedings and that will limit the claims to those arising on and after december 17 1991 the court has postponed the trial date from april 17 2006 in light of a case pending before the west virginia supreme court of appeals which may decide issues of law that may apply to the issue of deductibility of postproduction expenses we intend to challenge the class certification order by filing a petition for writ of prohibition with the west virginia supreme court of appeals 

we are vigorously defending the case we have established a reserve that management believes is adequate based on their estimate of the probable outcome of this case 

texas title litigation 

on january 6 2003 we were served with plaintiffs’ second amended original petition in romeo longoria et al v exxon mobil corporation et al in the 79th judicial district court of brooks county texas plaintiffs filed their second supplemental original petition on november 12 2004 and their third supplemental original petition on february 22 2005 which added wynncrosby 1996 ltd and dominion oklahoma texas exploration  production inc plaintiffs allege that they are the owners of a onehalf undivided mineral interest in and to certain lands in brooks county texas cody energy llc our subsidiary acquired certain leases and wells in 1997 and 1998 

the plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in minerals and all improvements on the lands on which we acquired these leases the plaintiffs also assert claims for trespass to try title action to remove a cloud on the title failure to properly account for royalty fraud trespass conversion all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages plaintiffs claim that they acquired title to the property by adverse possession plaintiffs also assert the discovery rule and a claim of fraudulent concealment to avoid the affirmative defense of limitations in august 2005 the case was abated until late february 2006 during which time the parties are allowed to amend pleadings or add additional parties to the litigation due to the abatement of the case we have 

  

not had the opportunity to conduct discovery in this matter we estimate that production revenue from this field since cody energy llc acquired title is approximately 157 million and that the carrying value of this property is approximately 336 million 

although the investigation into this claim continues we intend to vigorously defend the case should we receive an adverse ruling in this case an impairment review would be assessed to determine whether the carrying value of the property is recoverable management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable accordingly we have not established a reserve for this matter 

raymondville area 

in april 2004 our wholly owned subsidiary cody energy llc filed suit in state court in willacy county texas against certain of its coworking interest owners in the raymondville area located in kenedy and willacy counties in early 2003 cody had proposed a new prospect under the terms of the joint operating agreement some of the coworking interest owners elected not to participate the initial well was successful and subsequent wells have been drilled to exploit the discovery made in the first well 

the working interest owners who elected not to participate notified cody that they believed that they had the right to participate in wells drilled after the initial well cody contends that the working interest owners that elected not to participate are required to assign their interest in the prospect to those who elected to participate the defendants have filed a counter claim against the company and one of the defendants has filed a lien against cody’s interest in the leases in the raymondville area 

cody has signed a settlement agreement with certain of the defendants representing approximately 3 of the interest in the area cody and the remaining defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment in august 2005 the trial judge entered an order granting cody’s motion for summary judgment requiring the remaining defendant to assign to cody all of its interest in the prospect and to remove the lien filed against cody’s interest the defendant has filed a motion for reconsideration and opposition to proposed order the court has not yet made a decision on these two motions 

commitment and contingency reserves 

we have established reserves for certain legal proceedings the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately 102 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

while the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flow operating results however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil exploration and exploitation exclusively within the united states and canada 

overview 

cabot oil  gas and its subsidiaries are a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration development acquisition exploitation production and marketing of natural gas and to a lesser extent crude oil and natural gas liquids from its properties in north america we also transport store gather and produce natural gas for resale our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

at cabot there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital drilling opportunities acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2004 and 2005 the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices our realized natural gas and crude oil price was 674 per mcf and 4419 per bbl respectively in 2005 these realized prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments in an effort to manage commodity price risk we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps these financial instruments are an element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment 

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see “risk factors—natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business” and “risk factors—our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable” in item 1a 

  

the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated by month over 2004 and 2005 “index” represents the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2004” and “2005” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements as applicable 

 

 prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity price continued to maintain strength in 2004 and rose further in 2005 the tables below contain the nymex monthly average crude oil price index and our realized per barrel bbl crude oil prices by month for 2004 and 2005 the “2004” and “2005” price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements 

 

 we reported earnings of 304 per share or 1484 million for 2005 this is up from the 181 per share or 884 million reported in 2004 the stronger price environment was a primary contributor to the earnings increase due to the increase in natural gas and oil revenues prices including the realized impact of derivative instruments rose 30 for natural gas and 40 for oil 

we drilled 316 gross wells with a success rate of 95 in 2005 compared to 256 gross wells with a 95 success rate in 2004 total capital and exploration expenditures increased by 1661 million to 4256 million of which 731 million was for property acquisitions in 2005 compared to 2595 million for 2004 we believe our operating cash flow in 2006 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately 396 million and again provide excess cash flow any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions to pay current debt due repurchase common stock expand our capital program or other opportunities 

our 2006 strategy will remain consistent with 2005 we will remain focused on our strategies of balancing our capital investments between higher risk projects with the potential for higher returns and lower risk projects with more stable returns along with balancing longer life investments with impact exploration opportunities in the current year we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating regions we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term 

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read “forwardlooking information” for further details 

  

financial condition 

capital resources and liquidity 

our primary source of cash in 2005 was from funds generated from operations as well as borrowings on our revolving credit facility and to a lesser extent proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock plans we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years working capital is also substantially influenced by these variables during 2005 approximately 14 bcfe of expected production in our gulf coast region was deferred due to the impacts of hurricanes katrina and rita these hurricanes did not have a material adverse impact on our capital resources nor liquidity fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see “results of operations” for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures purchase treasury stock and pay dividends proceeds from the exercise of stock options under stock option plans during 2005 partially offset our repurchase of 452300 treasury shares of common stock at a weighted average purchase price of 4241 see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

 

 operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased 915 million over 2004 this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased 30 over 2004 while crude oil realized prices increased 40 over the same period production volumes declined slightly with a less than one percent reduction of equivalent production in 2005 compared to 2004 while we believe 2006 commodity production may exceed 2005 levels we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased 314 million over 2003 this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices key components of net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased 15 over 2003 while crude oil realized prices increased 7 over the same period production volumes declined with a 5 reduction of equivalent production in 2004 compared to 2003 see “results of operations” for a discussion on commodity prices and a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

investing activities the primary uses of cash by investing activities are capital spending and exploration expense we establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices due to the volatility of commodity prices our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities increased for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 in the amounts of 1568 million and 1035 million respectively the increase from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the east region and the rocky mountains area of our west region in response to higher commodity prices our continued drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase in addition we spent 731 million in proved property acquisitions primarily in the gulf coast the increase from 2003 to 2004 was also primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in response to higher commodity prices this increase largely occurred in our east region and the rocky mountains area of our west region our initial drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase 

  

financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were 482 million for the year ended december 31 2005 resulting from borrowings under the credit facility partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 were 84 million this is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 were 907 million this is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of 950 million cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows 

at december 31 2005 we had 90 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility the credit facility provides for an available credit line of 250 million which can be expanded up to 350 million either with the existing banks or new banks the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks’ petroleum engineer and other assets the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december 2009 we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings if necessary our capital requirements including potential acquisitions 

in august 1998 we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions as a result of the 3for2 stock split effected in march 2005 this figure has been adjusted to three million shares during 2005 we repurchased 452300 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 4241 all purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions there is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase our securities the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plan as of december 31 2005 was 1486150 see item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

capitalization 

information about our capitalization is as follows 

 

  for the year ended december 31 2005 we paid dividends of 72 million on our common stock a regular dividend of 004 per share of common stock or 0027 per share for dividends prior to the 3for2 stock split as adjusted for the split has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company 

capital and exploration expenditures 

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding significant oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

  

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2005 

 

 we plan to drill about 391 gross wells in 2006 compared with 316 gross wells drilled in 2005 this 2006 drilling program includes approximately 396 million in total capital and exploration expenditures down from 4256 million in 2005 capital and exploration expenditures in 2005 included a layer of 731 million in proved property acquisitions as shown in the table above we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period in 2006 management expects an increase in our depreciation depletion and amortization rate due to negative reserve revisions and higher capital costs this change may result in an increase of depreciation depletion and amortization of 10 to 15 greater than 2005 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

contractual obligations 

our known material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt firm gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 

a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 are set forth in the following table 

 

      

amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2005 is 430 million 

subsequent to december 31 2005 we entered into an agreement for one additional drilling rig in the gulf coast the total commitment over the next four years is 274 million of which 08 million 91 million 91 million and 84 million will be paid out during the years 2006 2007 2008 and 2009 respectively 

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the most significant policies are discussed below 

oil and gas reserves 

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate the estimation of reserves in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 

 

  

  

  

 since 1990 100 of our reserves have been reviewed by miller  lents ltd an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate we have not been required to record a significant reserve revision in the past three years for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the “supplemental oil and gas information” 

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization expense dda is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves which is utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 005 to 006 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 001 impact on our total dda rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to dda 

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

  

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a leasebylease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows in 2003 we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment review of the kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field in december 2003 our remaining interest in the field was sold for additional discussion on the kurten field impairment see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in 2004 and 2005 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 27 million or decrease by approximately 16 million respectively per year 

in the past the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions average property lives in the gulf coast east and west regions have been four seven and seven years respectively average property lives in canada are estimated to be six years as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas no 133 under sfas no 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective under sfas no 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas no 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue either in natural gas production or crude oil and condensate revenue on the statement of operations 

longterm employee benefit costs 

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates of return published for a theoretical portfolio of highquality fixed income securities in order to select the discount rate we use benchmarks such as the 

  

moody’s aa corporate rate which was 548 annualized for 2005 and the citigroup pension liability index which was 555 for 2005 we look to these benchmarks as well as considering durations of expected benefit payments we have determined based on these assumptions that a discount rate of 55 at december 31 2005 is reasonable 

in order to value our pension liabilities we use the rp2000 mortality table this is a widely accepted table used for valuing pension liabilities this table represents a more recent and conservative mortality table than the prior years’ 1983 group annuity mortality table and appears to be an appropriate table based on the demographics of our benefit plans another consideration that is made is a salary scale selection we have assumed that salaries will increase 4 based on our expectation of future salary increases 

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2005 the assumed rate of increase was 90 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

we have established objectives regarding plan assets in the pension plan in our pension calculations we have used 8 as the expected longterm return on plan assets for 2005 2004 and 2003 however we expect to achieve a minimum 5 annual real rate of return on the total portfolio over the long term we believe that this is a reasonable estimate based on our actual results the actual rate of return on plan assets annualized over the past ten years is approximately 10 

we generally target a portfolio of assets that are within a range of approximately 60 to 80 for equity securities and approximately 20 to 40 for fixed income securities large capitalization equities may make up a maximum of 65 of the portfolio small capitalization equities and international equities may make up a maximum of 30 and 15 respectively of the portfolio fixed income bonds may make up a maximum of 40 of our portfolio 

stockbased compensation 

prior to the issuance of sfas no 123r “share based payment revised 2004” there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stockbased compensation the first method is the intrinsic value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess if any of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock the second method is the fair value method under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period as of december 31 2005 we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method sfas no 123r requires that the fair value of stock options and any other equitybased compensation must be expensed at the grant date to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used we currently expense performance share awards however beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we will be required to expense all stockbased compensation further discussion of sfas no 123r and stock compensation is included in “recently issued accounting pronouncements” 

on october 26 2005 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration to december 15 2005 of the vesting of 198799 unvested stock options awarded in february 2003 under our second amended and restated 1994 longterm incentive plan and 24500 unvested stock options awarded in april 2004 under our 2004 incentive plan 

the 198799 shares awarded to employees under the 1994 plan at an exercise price of 1532 would have vested in february 2006 the 24500 shares awarded to nonemployee directors under the 2004 plan at an exercise price of 2332 would have vested 12250 shares in april 2006 and april 2007 respectively the decision to accelerate the vesting of these unvested options which we believed to be in the best interest of our shareholders and employees was made solely to reduce compensation expense and administrative burden associated with our adoption of sfas no 123r 

  

the accelerated vesting of the options did not have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows for 2005 the acceleration of vesting is expected to reduce our compensation expense related to these options by approximately 02 million for 2006 

other issues and contingencies 

corporate income tax  we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions for corporations other than integrated oil companies the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production” “natural gas marketing gathering and transportation” “federal regulation of petroleum” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 “business” for a discussion of these regulations 

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company’s various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at december 31 2005 we are in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 

limited partnership as part of the 2001 cody acquisition we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field as general partner of a partnership and as an operator we had approximately a 25 interest in the field including a one percent interest in the partnership under the partnership agreement we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50 upon the limited partner reaching payout based on the addition of this reversionary interest and because the field has over a 40year reserve life approximately 91 million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition additionally the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership 

effective february 13 2003 liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner the limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices primarily oil since their investment in 1999 we proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a nonoperated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation in connection with the liquidation an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets additionally we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with sfas no 144 pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field the limited partner’s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation an impairment review was performed which required an impairment charge in the first quarter of 2003 of 879 million 544 million aftertax this impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 statement of operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows 

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see “risk factors—we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses” in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

  

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in march 2005 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” this interpretation clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the company fin no 47 states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable this interpretation is intended to provide more information about longlived assets more information about future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities fin no 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 our financial position results of operations and cash flows were not impacted by this interpretation since we currently record all asset retirement obligations 

on april 4 2005 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas 191 “accounting for suspended well costs” this staff position amends fasb statement no 19 “financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies” and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting the position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if 1 a sufficient quantity of reserves are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well’s economic and operating feasibility if the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria these costs should be expensed net of any salvage value additional annual disclosures are required to provide information about management’s evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs in addition the staff position requires the annual disclosure of 1 net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves 2 the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and 3 an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to further the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation for our disclosures refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error correctionsa replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” in order to enhance financial reporting consistency between periods sfas no 154 modifies the requirements for the accounting and reporting of the direct effects of changes in accounting principles under apb opinion no 20 the cumulative effect of voluntary changes in accounting principle 

  

was recognized in net income in the period of the change unlike the treatment previously prescribed by apb opinion no 20 retrospective application is now required unless it is not practical to determine the specific effects in each period or the cumulative effect if the period specific effects cannot be determined it is required that the new accounting principle must be retrospectively applied in the earliest period possible to the balance sheet accounts and a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or another equity account if the cumulative effect cannot be determined it is necessary to apply the new accounting principles prospectively at the earliest practical date if it is not feasible to retrospectively apply the change in principle the reason that this is not possible and the method used to report the change is required to be disclosed the statement also provides that changes in accounting for depreciation depletion or amortization should be treated as changes in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle and that disclosure of the preferability of the change is required sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r revises sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and focuses on accounting for sharebased payments for services provided by employee to employer the statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equitybased compensation at the grant date the statement does not require a certain type of valuation model and either a binomial or blackscholes model may be used during the first quarter of 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec approved a new rule for public companies to delay the adoption of this standard in april 2005 the sec took further action to amend regulation sx to state that the provisions of sfas no 123r will be effective beginning with the first annual or interim reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 for all nonsmall business issuers as a result we will not adopt this sfas until the first quarter of 2006 we plan to use the modified prospective application method as detailed in sfas no 123r at this time management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 123r will materially impact our operating results nor will there be any impact on our future cash flows see “stockbased compensation” below for further information 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 123r2 “practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 123r” this fsp provides guidance on the definition and practical application of “grant date” as described in sfas no 123r the grant date is described as the date that the employee and employer have met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award the other elements of the definition of grant date are 1 the award must be authorized 2 the employer must be obligated to transfer assets or distribute equity instruments so long as the employee has provided the necessary service and 3 the employee is affected by changes in the company’s stock price to determine the grant date we are allowed to use the date the award is approved in accordance with our corporate governance requirements so long as the three elements described above are met furthermore the recipient cannot negotiate the award’s terms and conditions with the employer and the key terms and conditions of the award are communicated to all recipients within a reasonably short time period from the approval date we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 123r 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards” which provides a simpler more practical transition election relating to the calculation of the “apic pool” the apic pool is defined as the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies occurring after the adoption of sfas no 123r under this fsp companies can elect to perform simpler computations to derive the beginning balance of the apic pool as well as the impact on the apic pool of fully vested and outstanding awards as of the sfas no 123r adoption date the beginning balance can be computed by taking the sum of all tax benefits incurred prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r from stockbased compensation plans less the tax effected using a blended statutory rate pro forma stockbased compensation cost in addition increases to the apic pool for fully vested awards can be calculated by multiplying the tax rate times the tax benefit of the deduction the calculation of any awards that are partially vested or granted after the sfas no 123r adoption date will not be affected by this fsp and will be calculated in accordance with sfas no 123r which requires that only the excess tax benefit or deficiency of the tax deduction over the tax effect of the compensation cost recognized should be considered for the apic pool also under the fsp all tax benefits recognized on fully vested awards and the excess tax benefits for partially vested and new awards will be reported on the statement of cash flows as a component of financing activities companies will have up to one year after adopting sfas no 123r to decide to elect and disclose whether they plan to use the alternative method or the original method prescribed in sfas no 123r for the calculation of the apic pool we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 123r 

  

in february 2006 the fasb issued fsp fas 123r4 “classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event” within certain sharebased payment plans a company can be required to settle outstanding options upon the occurrence of certain events such as a change in control or liquidity of a company or the death or disability of the shareholder this fsp amends paragraphs 32 and a229 of sfas no 123r to incorporate a probability assessment by a company under sfas no 123r it is required that options and similar instruments be classified as liabilities if the entity can be required under any circumstances to settle the instrument in cash or other assets under the fsp a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside of the employee’s control does not meet the criteria for liability classification and should remain to be classified in equity unless it becomes probable that the contingent event will occur the effective date for the guidance in this fsp is upon the initial adoption of sfas no 123r we will adopt this fsp in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 123r

results of operations 

2005 and 2004 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2005 of 1484 million or 304 per share during 2004 we reported net income of 884 million or 181 per share operating income increased by 980 million compared to the prior year from 1607 million to 2587 million the increase in operating income from 2004 to 2005 was principally due to an increase in natural gas and oil production revenues partially offset by an increase in total operating expenses net income increased from 2004 to 2005 by 600 million due to an increase in operating income partially offset by an increase of 376 million in income tax expense 

natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 674 per mcf compared to 520 per mcf for the comparable period of the prior year these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 133 per mcf in 2005 and 076 per mcf in 2004 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 11 million and 09 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the natural gas production revenues line item in the statement of operations 

  

 the increase in natural gas production revenue is due substantially to the increase in natural gas sales prices in addition the slight increase in production was due to the successful drilling programs in the east west and canada partially offsetting this was the decrease in the gulf coast production the increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the increase in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 1193 million 

  

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the increased brokered natural gas margin of 22 million was driven by an increased sales price that outpaced the increase in purchase cost offset in part by a decrease in volume 

  

crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price for 2005 including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 4419 per bbl compared to 3155 per bbl for 2004 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 993 per bbl in 2005 and 898 per bbl in 2004 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 55 million and the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair value of 29 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the crude oil and condensate revenues line item in the statement of operations 

 

 the increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 139 million the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of the decrease in the gulf coast region production due to the continued natural decline of the clf lease in south louisiana as well as the impact of hurricanes which included the shutting in and deferring of production at the breton sound offshore lease one of our largest areas of offshore oil production 

  

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 

other operating revenues 

other operating revenues decreased 36 million this change was primarily a result of an increase in our payout liability associated with the reduction of our interest due to customary reversionary interest owned by others which correspondingly decreased other operating revenues in addition our revenues from net profits interest declined over the prior year this revenue variance also results to a lesser extent from changes in our wellhead gas imbalances over the previous year 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations increased 545 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 interest expense net 

interest expense net increased 01 million interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility was higher in the current year due to higher average borrowings average borrowings based on month end balances for the 2005 year were approximately 130 million compared to approximately 95 million in the prior year in addition the effective interest rate on the credit facility increased to 69 during 2005 from 42 during the prior year partially offsetting this was an increase in interest income on our shortterm investments 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 376 million due to an increase in our pretax net income 

2004 and 2003 compared 

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2004 of 884 million or 181 per share during 2003 we reported net income of 211 million or 044 per share operating income increased by 941 million compared to the prior year from 666 million to 1607 million the increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from 2003 to 2004 related to the decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of 903 million related to the loss in 2003 of a reversionary interest in the kurten field in addition the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices 

natural gas production revenues 

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 520 per mcf compared to 451 per mcf for the comparable period of the prior year these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 076 per mcf in 2004 and 068 per mcf in 2003 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 09 million and the unrealized loss of 15 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the natural gas production revenues line item in the statement of operations 

  

 the increase in natural gas production revenues was mainly a result of increased sales prices as well as the increase in overall production natural gas production was up slightly from the prior year and production revenues also increased from 2003 natural gas production increased slightly in all regions except the west region where the decline in production was due to lower capital spending in 2003 and continued natural decline the increases in both sales price and production resulted in an increase in natural gas production revenues of 547 million 

  

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

 

 the decrease in brokered natural gas revenues of 113 million combined with the decline in brokered natural gas cost of 109 million resulted in a decrease to the brokered natural gas margin of 05 million 

  

crude oil and condensate revenues 

our average total company realized crude oil sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 3155 per bbl compared to 2955 per bbl for 2003 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 898 per bbl in 2004 and 141 per bbl in 2003 the following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair value of 29 million and 19 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the crude oil and condensate revenues line item in the statement of operations 

 

 the decline in crude oil production is due to emphasis on natural gas in the gulf coast drilling program along with the natural decline of existing production in south louisiana the increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue decrease of 200 million 

  

impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

the following table reflects the realized impact of cash settlements and the net unrealized change in fair value of derivative instruments 

 

 we are exposed to market risk to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 

other operating revenues 

other operating revenues decreased 37 million this change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 

operating expenses 

total costs and expenses from operations decreased 853 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

interest expense net 

interest expense decreased 17 million this variance is due to a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility offset somewhat by an increase in prime rates average daily borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the year were 05 million in 2004 which is a decrease from 07 million in 2003 our other remaining debt is at fixed interest rates 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased 352 million due to an increase in our pretax net income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend derivative instruments and hedging activity 

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production under our revolving credit agreement the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100 of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges at december 31 2005 we had nine cash flow hedges open eight natural gas price collar arrangements and one crude oil price collar arrangement at december 31 2005 a 207 million 129 million net of tax unrealized loss was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income along with a 224 million shortterm derivative liability and a 17 million shortterm derivative receivable which is shown in other current assets on the balance sheet the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate 

assuming no change in commodity prices after december 31 2005 we would expect to reclassify to the statement of operations over the next 12 months 129 million in aftertax charges associated with commodity hedges this reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december 31 2005 related to anticipated 2006 production 

hedges on production  swaps 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these derivatives are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures during 2005 natural gas price swaps covered 20557 mmcf or 28 of our gas production fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of 514 per mcf 

at december 31 2005 we had no open natural gas price swap contracts covering 2006 production 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 133 these financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date at december 31 2005 we did not have any of these types of arrangements 

  

hedges on production  options 

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us during 2005 natural gas price collars covered 15157 mmcf of our gas production or 21 of our gas production with a weighted average floor of 559 per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of 861 per mcf during 2005 an oil price collar covered 365 mbbl of our crude oil production or 21 of our crude oil production with a weighted average floor of 4000 per mbbl and a weighted average ceiling of 5050 per mbbl 

at december 31 2005 we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our 2006 production as follows 

 

 at december 31 2005 we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering our 2006 production as follows 

 

 we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

  

cabot oil  gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration development acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties located in north america the five principal areas of operation are appalachian basin rocky mountains anadarko basin onshore and offshore the texas and louisiana gulf coast and the gas basin of west canada operationally we have four regional offices located in the east region the west region which is comprised of the rocky mountains and midcontinent areas the gulf coast region and canada 

  

in 2004 energy commodity prices remained strong throughout the year this strong price environment allowed us to pursue our largest organic capital program ever while still maintaining our financial flexibility this flexibility should provide us the ability to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities that may arise at december 31 2004 our debt to total capital ratio was 37 down from 43 at the end of 2003 natural gas production increased to 728 bcf in 2004 from 719 bcf in 2003 this growth was directly related to our 2003 drilling program which focused on natural gas projects on an equivalent basis our production level in 2004 was down slightly from 2003 we produced 848 bcfe or 2323 mmcfe per day this year as compared to 890 bcfe or 2438 mmcfe per day in 2003 the growth in natural gas production was offset by the loss of production associated with the late 2003 sale of nonstrategic properties and natural decline in oil production in south louisiana our 2004 realized natural gas price was 520 per mcf compared to a 2003 price of 451 our realized crude oil price was 3155 per bbl compared to a 2003 price of 2955 our average hedged prices on natural gas and crude oil for 2005 anticipated production are expected to be higher than comparable prices realized from hedging in 2004 to lock in prices above historical levels for a portion of our production as a result of the strong commodity prices we layered in oil and gas hedge instruments throughout 2004 to cover production in 2004 and 2005 at december 31 2004 44 and 25 of our natural gas and crude oil anticipated production respectively are hedged for 2005 through the use of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting including our range swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting 75 of our crude oil production is hedged for 2005 no derivatives are in place for 2006 our decision to hedge 2005 production fits with our risk management strategy and allows the company to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices on a portion of our anticipated production 

  

net income of 884 million or 272 per share exceeded last year by 672 million or 206 per share the year over year net income increase was achieved due to higher natural gas revenues from higher commodity prices operating revenues increased by 210 million or 4 due to strong commodity prices natural gas production revenues increased by 571 million over the prior year this increase was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil and condensate revenues of 210 million and a decrease in brokered natural gas revenues of 114 million in addition operating expenses decreased between 2004 and 2003 as a result of the 2003 noncash pretax impairment charge of 938 million also contributing to the decrease were lower brokered natural gas cost and lower exploration expense net income in 2003 was also reduced by a 68 million cumulative effect of accounting change related to sfas 143 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 we drilled 256 gross wells with a success rate of 95 compared to 173 gross wells with a success rate of 89 for the comparable period of the prior year our 2004 capital and exploration spending was 2595 million compared to 1882 million in 2003 we concentrated our 2004 capital spending program on projects balancing acceptable risk with the strongest economics in the past we have used a portion of the cash flow from our longlived east and midcontinent natural gas reserves to fund our exploration and development efforts in the gulf coast and rocky mountain areas in 2004 we continued that practice to a lesser extent as we increased our capital expenditures in the east in response to the success of the 2003 drilling program the main recipient of these dollars was canada where we commenced our drilling program with a 162 million investment in 2005 we plan to spend approximately 280 million which includes a layer of investment for new projects or property acquisitions that may arise during 2005 

  

our proved reserves totaled approximately 1202 bcfe at december 31 2004 of which 94 was natural gas this reserve level was up slightly from 1142 bcfe at december 31 2003 on the strength of results from our drilling program and the lack of reserve sales during the year

the following table presents certain information as of december 31 2004 

  

     

east region 

  

our east activities are concentrated in west virginia and to a lesser extent in new york in this region our assets include a large undeveloped acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity capital and exploration expenditures were 752 million for 2004 or 29 of our total 2004 capital spending and 406 million for 2003 for 2005 we have budgeted 753 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

  

at december 31 2004 we had 2584 wells 23933 net of which 2497 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include the big lime weir berea devonian shale and oriskany formations at depths primarily ranging from 1000 to 9500 feet average net daily production in 2004 was 536 mmcfe while natural gas production volumes from east reservoirs are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states the productive life of east reserves is relatively long at december 31 2004 we had 5505 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the east region constituting 46 of our total proved reserves this region is managed from our office in charleston west virginia

in 2004 we produced and marketed approximately 80 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the east region at market responsive prices 

  

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2004 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

  

  

 4  

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to increase for shorter intervals of time the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the east region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

  

the principal markets for our east region natural gas are in the northeast united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system cabot oil  gas marketing our subsidiary purchases gas from local thirdparty producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of gas for resale 

  

approximately 65 of our natural gas sales volume in the east region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one year or greater in addition spot market sales are made under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately 2 of east production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually

capital and exploration expenditures in canada were 162 million for 2004 or 6 of our total capital and exploration expenditures and 08 million for 2003 for 2005 we have budgeted 160 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area 

  

we had 14 wells 15 net in the canada region as of december 31 2004 of which 3 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in the canada region are in the falher bluesky cadomin and the swan hills formations at depths ranging from 9500 to 16000 feet average net daily production in canada during 2004 was 10 mmcfe 

  

in 2004 we drilled 4 wells 15 net in canada of which 3 wells 11 net were development and extension wells in 2005 we plan to drill 10 wells 

  

in 2004 we produced and marketed approximately 10 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the canada region at market responsive prices 

  

risk management 

  

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2004 we primarily employed natural gas and oil price swap and collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor 

  

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – commodity price swaps and options for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives

the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum engineers miller and lents concluded the following in their judgment 1 we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues 2 we used appropriate engineering geologic and evaluation principles in making our estimates and projections and 3 our total proved reserves are reasonable for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those filed by us with other federal agencies our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of december 2004 

  

there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing therefore the reserve information in this form 10k represents only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers may vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced

well summary 

  

the following table presents our ownership at december 31 2004 in natural gas and oil wells in the gulf coast region consisting primarily of various fields located in louisiana and texas in the west region consisting of various fields located in oklahoma kansas colorado and wyoming in the east region consisting of various fields located in west virginia virginia and ohio and in the canada region consisting of various fields located in the provinces of alberta and british columbia this summary includes natural gas and oil wells in which we have a working interest 

  

    

drilling activity 

  

we drilled wells participated in the drilling of wells or acquired wells as indicated in the region table below 

  

    

  

 13  

competition 

  

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery records affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers in the east region who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we also believe that our competitive position in the east region is enhanced by the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas companies we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources particularly in the west and gulf coast regions and canada 

  

other business matters 

  

major customer 

  

in 2004 approximately 11 of our total sales were made to one customer in 2003 and 2002 approximately 11 and 14 respectively of our total sales were made to one customer in 2002 this customer operated certain properties in which we have interests in the gulf coast and purchased all of the production from these wells this customer would resell the natural gas and oil to third parties with whom we would deal directly if the customer either ceased to exist or stopped buying our portion of the production 

  

seasonality 

  

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

  

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

  

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

  

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect 

  

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also developed rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates and implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

  

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

  

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter 

  

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

  

  

 15  

federal regulation of petroleum 

  

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year these regulations have generally been approved on judicial review every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the first such review was completed in december 2000 where the ferc concluded that the rate index reasonably reflected actual pipeline costs upon judicial review the pipeline transportation rates established under the index were increased slightly the next review is scheduled in july 2005 another ferc proceeding that may impact our transportation costs relates to an ongoing proceeding to determine whether and to what extent pipelines should be permitted to include in their transportation rates an allowance for income taxes attributable to noncorporate partnership interests we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these relatively new federal regulations or of the periodic review by the ferc of the index or the ongoing review of the income tax allowance 

  

environmental regulations 

  

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

  

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

  

outer continental shelf lands act the federal outer continental shelf lands act ocsla and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto impose a variety of regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees permits and other parties operating on the outer continental shelf specific design and operational standards may apply to outer continental shelf vessels rigs platforms vehicles and structures violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution we believe that we substantially comply with the ocsla and its regulations 

  

  

 16  

solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

  

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed 

  

oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations 

  

clean water act  the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

  

clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 cabot oil  gas had 346 active employees we recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we maintain with our employees overall we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory the company and its employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement

other 

  

our profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond our control such as natural gas and crude oil prices please see items 7 and 7a we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses our business involves a variety of operating risks including blowouts cratering explosions and fires mechanical problems uncontrolled flows of oil natural gas or well fluids formations with abnormal pressures pollution and other environmental risks and natural disasters we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather 

  

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures any of these events could result in loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have invested a higher percentage of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east at december 31 2004 we owned or operated approximately 3300 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems throughout the united states as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe may require repair replacement or additional maintenance and we schedule this maintenance as appropriate 

  

the sale of our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control the factors include the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to access these facilities and obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business all known liabilities are fully accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss while the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position operating results and cash flow however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved 

  

wyoming royalty litigation 

  

in june 2000 we were sued by two overriding royalty owners in wyoming state court for unspecified damages the plaintiffs requested class certification and alleged that we had improperly deducted costs of production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons additionally the suit claimed that we had failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of the deductions taken from royalties at a mediation held in april 2003 the plaintiffs in this case claimed total damages of 95 million plus attorney fees we settled the case for a total of 225 million and the state district court judge entered his order approving the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2003 the class included all private fee royalty and overriding royalty owners of the company in the state of wyoming except those in the suit discussed below and one owner who opted out of the settlement it also includes provisions for the method of valuation of gas for royalty payment purposes going forward and for reporting of royalty payments which should prevent further litigation of these issues by the class members 

  

in january 2002 13 overriding royalty owners sued us in wyoming federal district court the plaintiffs in the federal case have made the same general claims pertaining to deductions from their overriding royalty as the plaintiffs in the wyoming state court case but have not asked for class certification 

  

the federal district court judge certified two questions of state law for decision by the wyoming state supreme court which recently answered both questions the wyoming supreme court ruled that certain deductions taken by us from the plaintiffs were not proper and that the statutes of limitations advanced by us are discovery statutes and accordingly do not begin to run until the plaintiffs knew or had reason to know of the violation we believe we have properly reported to the plaintiffs and that if we did not the plaintiffs knew or should have known the reporting was improper and the nature of the deductions thus triggering the statutes of limitations we still intend to raise defenses to the alleged failure to report claims there is also a dispute as to how the interest should be calculated 

  

the federal judge refused to certify a question relating to the issue of the proper calculation of damages for failure to provide certain information required by statute on overriding royalty owner check stubs that had been decided adversely to our position in a state district court letter decision in a separate case after the federal judge’s refusal to certify this issue the plaintiffs reduced the damages they were claiming based upon recent communication from the plaintiffs they are now claiming 262 million in total damages which consists of 203 million for alleged violations of the check stub reporting statute and 59 million for all other damages 

  

in the opinion of our outside counsel brown drew  massey llp the likelihood of the plaintiffs recovering 203 million for the check stub reporting statute is remote however a reserve that management believes is adequate to provide for the check stub reporting statute and all other damages has been established based on management’s estimate at this time of the probable outcome of this case 

  

west virginia royalty litigation 

  

in december 2001 we were sued by two royalty owners in west virginia state court for an unspecified amount of damages the plaintiffs have requested class certification under the west virginia rules of civil procedure and allege that we failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas produced that it had taken improper deductions from the royalty and failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of deductions taken from the royalty the plaintiffs have also claimed that they are entitled to a 1  8 th royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement that we reached with columbia gas transmission corporation in the 1995 columbia gas transmission corporation bankruptcy proceeding 

  

 19  

discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the state court have been ongoing a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was held on october 20 2003 and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were submitted to the court on december 5 2003 a status conference was held with the court and the court advised it intends to issue a ruling on the class certification motion the court was expected to rule by december 2004 and we are still awaiting a decision discovery is proceeding on the claims pending the ruling on the class certification motion discovery is to be completed by april 1 2005 and the trial is currently scheduled for august 15 2005 if a class is certified it is expected this trial date will be continued to a later date 

  

the investigation into this claim continues and it is in the discovery phase we are vigorously defending the case we have a reserve that management believes is adequate based on its estimate at this time of the probable outcome of this case 

  

texas title litigation 

  

on january 6 2003 we were served with plaintiffs’ second amended original petition in romeo longoria et al v exxon mobil corporation et al in the 79th judicial district court of brooks county texas plaintiffs filed their first supplemental original petition on march 17 2004 and their second supplemental petition on november 12 2004 the significant change in the second supplemental petition is that plaintiffs appear to limit their claim to the mineral estate rather than making claims to both the surface and mineral estate the plaintiffs allege that they are the rightful owners of a onehalf undivided mineral interest in and to certain lands in brooks county texas as cody energy llc we acquired certain leases and wells from wynncrosby 1996 ltd in 1997 and 1998 and we subsequently acquired a 320 acre lease from hector and gloria lopez in 2001 the plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in minerals and all improvements on the lands on which we acquired these leases the plaintiffs also assert claims for trespass to try title action to remove a cloud on the title failure to properly account for royalty fraud trespass conversion all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages the original trial date of may 19 2003 was cancelled and a new trial date has not been set we have not had the opportunity to conduct discovery in this matter we estimate that production revenue from this field since its predecessor cody energy llc acquired title and since we acquired its lease is approximately 149 million the carrying value of this property is approximately 34 million codefendants shell oil company and shell western ep filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ causes of action on multiple grounds the original plaintiffs’ attorneys asked permission from the court to withdraw from the representation the court granted that request and new attorneys for some but not all of the plaintiffs have recently entered the case the motion for summary judgment was reset and a hearing was held in december of 2003 we joined in the motion after a second hearing the court denied the motion for summary judgment the defendants have moved to add parties whose title interests are being challenged by the plaintiffs and who are therefore necessary to the case or in the alternative abate the proceeding until the plaintiffs join all parties whose interests may be affected by plaintiffs’ claims 

  

although the investigation into this claim is in its early stages we intend to vigorously defend the case should we receive an adverse ruling in this case an impairment review would be assessed to ensure the carrying value of the property is recoverable management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable accordingly there has been no reserve established for this matter

raymondville area 

  

in april 2004 our wholly owned subsidiary cody energy llc filed suit in willacy county texas against certain of our coworking interest owners in the raymondville area located in kenedy and willacy counties in early 2003 cody had proposed a new prospect to certain of these coworking interest owners located within jointly owned oil and gas leases some of the coworking interest owners elected to participate and some did not the initial well was successful and subsequent wells have been drilled to exploit the discovery made in the first well 

  

in december 2003 certain of the coworking interest owners who elected not to participate in the initial well notified cody that they believed that they had the right to participate in subsequent wells cody contends that under the terms of the agreements between the parties the coworking interest owners that elected not to participate in the initial well in the prospect were required to assign their interest in the proposed prospect to those who elected to participate alternatively cody contends that such owners lost their right to participate in subsequent wells within a 1200 foot radius of the initial well 

  

the defendants have filed a counter claim against us and one of the defendants has filed a lien against cody’s interest in the leases in the raymondville area cody contends that this lien is improper and has sought damages for its filing cody is vigorously prosecuting this case which is in its early stage of discovery no trial date has been set by the court 

  

certain of the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment contending that they did not have adequate notice of the prospect proposal cody is contesting this motion in addition in late december 2004 cody filed a motion for final summary judgment asking the court to find that under the terms of the agreements cody and the participating working interest owners are entitled to an assignment of the interests of the coworking interest owners who elected not to participate in the prospect no hearing date has been set by the court 

  

management cannot currently determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or range of any potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable accordingly there has been no reserve established for this matter 

  

commitment and contingency reserves 

  

we have established reserves for certain legal proceedings the establishment of a reserve involves an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management while management believes these reserves to be adequate it is reasonably possible that we could incur approximately 111 million of additional loss with respect to those matters in which reserves have been established future changes in the facts and circumstances could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued 

  

while the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position operating results and cash flow however could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

  

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read forwardlooking information on page 36 

  

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil exploration and development 

  

overview 

  

cabot oil  gas is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in north america our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

  

at cabot there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital these include drilling opportunities acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 

  

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2003 and 2004 the futures market reported unprecedented natural gas and crude oil contract prices our realized natural gas and crude oil price net of the impact of derivative instruments was 520 per mcf and 3155 per bbl respectively in 2004 to ensure a certain rate of return for our program we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps these financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment 

  

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success 

  

the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2003 and 2004 “index” represents the henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2003” and “2004” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and includes the realized impact of our natural gas price collar and swap arrangements as applicable 

  

 25  

    

   

prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity price continued to maintain strength in 2003 and rose further in 2004 the tables below contain the nymex average crude oil price index and our realized per barrel bbl crude oil prices by month for 2003 and 2004 the “2003” and “2004” price is the crude oil price per bbl realized by us and includes the realized impact of our crude oil derivative arrangements 

  

    

we reported earnings of 272 per share or 884 million for 2004 this is up from the 066 per share or 211 million reported in 2003 the decline in impairments of oil and gas properties was the driving factor in this improvement in 2003 there was an aftertax impairment of 544 million related to our kurten field see limited partnership for discussion of the impairment in addition the stronger price environment contributed to the earnings increase prices including the impact of the hedge arrangements rose 15 for natural gas and 7 for oil 

  

we drilled 256 gross wells with a success rate of 95 in 2004 compared to 173 gross wells with an 89 success rate in 2003 total capital and exploration expenditures increased 713 million to 2595 million in 2004 compared to 1882 million for 2003 we believe our operating cash flow in 2005 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of approximately 280 million and again provide excess cash flow any excess cash flow may be used for acquisitions to pay current debt due repurchase common stock expand our capital program or other opportunities 

  

our 2005 strategy will remain consistent with 2004 focusing on a disciplined approach to investment that balances our drilling effort between exploration opportunities and the development program along with acquisition opportunities and a continued financial focus including stock buyback and debt repayment

financial condition 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

our primary source of cash in 2004 was from funds generated from operations proceeds from the sale of common stock under stock option plans during 2004 roughly offset our repurchase of 405100 treasury shares of company stock at a weighted average purchase price of 3858 the company generates cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years working capital is substantially influenced by these variables fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures purchase treasury stock and pay dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

  

   

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased 314 million over 2003 this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average realized natural gas prices increased 15 over 2003 while crude oil realized prices increased 7 over the same period production volumes declined slightly with a 5 percent reduction of equivalent production in 2004 compared to 2003 while we believe 2005 commodity production may exceed 2004 levels we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased 775 million over 2002 this increase is primarily due to higher commodity prices key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices production volumes and operating costs average natural gas prices increased 49 over 2002 while crude oil prices increased 24 over the same period production volumes declined slightly with a 2 reduction of equivalent production in 2003 compared to 2002 see page 25 for a discussion on commodity prices and results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales revenue 

  

 27  

investing activities the primary driver of cash used by investing activities is capital spending and exploration expense we establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices due to the volatility of commodity prices our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year cash flows used in investing activities increased for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 in the amounts of 1035 million and 132 million the increase from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity as a result of higher commodity prices this increase largely occurred in our east region and the rocky mountain area of our west region our initial drilling activity in canada also contributed to the increase cash flows used in investing activities increased from 2002 to 2003 due to an increase in capital spending and exploration expense in response to higher commodity prices and exploitation of acquired properties this increase was partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of certain nonstrategic assets 

  

financing activities cash flows used by financing activities were 84 million for the year ended december 31 2004 this is the result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the purchase of treasury shares and dividend payments cash flows used by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 907 million this is substantially due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility in the amount of 950 million cash utilized for the repayments was generated from operating cash flows the cash flows used by financing activities in 2002 is primarily due to a net repayment on our revolving credit facility of 250 million 

  

the available credit line under our revolving credit facility which was 250 million at year end but can be expanded up to 350 million is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the bank’s petroleum engineer and other assets at december 31 2004 we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility the revolving term of the credit facility ends in december 2009 we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings if necessary our capital requirements including acquisitions 

  

our board of directors authorized the repurchase of two million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions all purchases executed have been through open market transactions there is no expiration date associated with the authorization to repurchase securities of the company see “issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer repurchases of equity securities” for additional information 

  

  

 28  

capitalization 

  

information about our capitalization is as follows 

  

      

for the year ended december 31 2004 we paid dividends of 52 million on our common stock a regular dividend of 004 per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company 

  

capital and exploration expenditures 

  

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary our revolving credit facility we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

  

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2004 

  

   

we plan to drill about 300 gross wells in 2005 compared with 256 gross wells drilled in 2004 this 2005 drilling program includes approximately 2800 million in total capital and exploration expenditures up from 2595 million in 2004 we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

  

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period in 2005 management expects an increase in our depreciation depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and higher capital costs this change may result in an increase of depreciation depletion and amortization of 5 to 10 greater than 2004 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

  

 29  

contractual obligations 

  

our known material contractual obligations include longterm debt interest on longterm debt and operating leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 

  

a summary of our known contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 are set forth in the following table 

  

     

amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december 31 2004 is 404 million 

  

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

  

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the most significant policies are discussed below 

  

oil and gas reserves 

  

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the degree of uncertainty varies among the three regions in which we operate the estimation of reserves in the gulf coast region requires more estimates than the east and west regions and inherently has more uncertainty surrounding reserve estimation the differences in the reserve estimation process are substantially due to the geological conditions in which the wells are drilled the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 

  

   

   

   

   

in 2004 2003 and 2002 100 of our reserves were subject to an external review by miller  lents ltd an independent oil and gas reservoir engineering consulting firm who in their opinion determined the estimates to be reasonable in the aggregate additionally in 2004 2003 and 2002 we did not have a significant reserve revision recorded for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas disclosure beginning on page 85 

  

  

 30  

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization expense dda is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves which is utilized in our unitofproduction method calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record dda expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dda rate by approximately 004 to 005 per mcfe revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dda rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would have a 002 impact on our total dda rate 

  

in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 

  

carrying value of oil and gas properties 

  

we evaluate the impairment of our oil and gas properties on a leasebylease basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows in 2002 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test in 2003 we significantly revised the estimated cash flow utilized in our impairment review of the kurten field due to a loss of a reversionary interest in the field in december 2003 our remaining interest in the field was sold for additional discussion on the kurten field impairment see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in 2004 there were no unusual or unexpected occurrences that caused significant revisions in estimated cash flows which were utilized in our impairment test 

  

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past experience and average property lives average property lives are determined on a regional basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property lives in each of the regions have not significantly changed however if the average property life increases the amount of the amortization charge in a given reporting period will decrease if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 23 million or decrease by approximately 19 million respectively per year 

  

in the past the average leasehold life in the gulf coast region has been shorter than the average life in the east and west regions average property lives in the gulf coast east and west regions have been four six and six years respectively average property lives in canada are estimated to be five years as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration program 

  

 31  

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

  

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas 133 under sfas 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as an effective hedge under sfas 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations 

  

longterm employee benefit costs 

  

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

  

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for highquality fixed income securities 

  

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2004 the assumed rate of increase was 100 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

  

stock based compensation 

  

prior to the issuance of sfas 123r “share based payment” there were two alternative methods that could be used to account for stockbased compensation the first method is the intrinsic value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess if any of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock the second method is the fair value method under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period currently we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method sfas 123r requires that the fair value of stock options and any other equitybased compensation must be expensed at the grant date to calculate the fair value either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model may be used we currently expense performance share awards however beginning in the third quarter of 2005 we will be required to expense all stock based compensation further discussion of sfas 123r and stock compensation is included in “recently issued accounting pronouncements” on page 35 

  

 32  

other issues and contingencies 

  

corporate income tax  we generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounted to 052 per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992 a number of wells drilled in the east region and rocky mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale was 109 per mmbtu in 2002 in 1995 and 1996 we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits resulting in revenues of 20 million in 2002 the tax credit wells were repurchased in december 2002 and no tax credits were generated in 2003 or 2004 as the credits expired in 2002 see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 

  

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see “regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation” and “environmental regulations” in the “other business matters” section of item 1 “business” for a discussion of these regulations 

  

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company’s various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and the notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at december 31 2004 we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and the notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 

  

limited partnership as part of the 2001 cody acquisition we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field as general partner of a partnership and as an operator we had approximately a 25 interest in the field including a one percent interest in the partnership under the partnership agreement we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to 50 upon the limited partner reaching payout based on the addition of this reversionary interest and because the field has over a 40year reserve life approximately 91 million was allocated to this field under purchase accounting at the time of the acquisition additionally the limited partner had the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership 

  

effective february 13 2003 liquidation of the partnership commenced at the election of the limited partner the limited partner was a financial entity and not an industry operator their decision to liquidate was based upon their perception that the value of their investment in the partnership had increased due to an increase in underlying commodity prices primarily oil since their investment in 1999 we proceeded with the liquidation to avoid having a minority interest in a nonoperated water flood field for which the new operator was not designated at the time of liquidation in connection with the liquidation an appraisal was required to be obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets additionally we were required to test the field for recoverability in accordance with fas 144 pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement and based on the appraised value of the partnership assets it was not possible for us to obtain the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field the limited partner’s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation an impairment review was performed which required an aftertax impairment charge in the first quarter of 2003 of 544 million this impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 statement of operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows 

  

  

 33  

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks any of these events could result in loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have invested a significant portion of our drilling dollars in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

  

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

  

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in may 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no fas 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” this fsp provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the act for employers that sponsor postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug benefits this fsp also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the act the subsidy this fsp supersedes fsp 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” and is effective for the first interim period beginning after june 15 2004 our current accumulated projected benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost does not reflect any amount associated with the subsidy furthermore in 2004 we amended our postretirement benefit plan to exclude prescription drug benefits for participants age 65 and older effective january 1 2006 the adoption of this fsp is not expected to impact our operating results financial position or cash flows 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 151 “inventory costs—an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” in an effort to unite the united states accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards leading to consistent application of certain accounting requirements fas 151 addresses accounting for abnormal amounts of freight handling costs idle facility expense and spoilage wasted material and requires that these costs be recognized as current period expenses previously these costs had to be categorized as “so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges” in addition allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion must be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities fas 151 will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact our operating results financial position or cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets – an amendment of apb opinion no 29” this statement requires that nonmonetary exchanges must be recorded at fair value and the appropriate gain or loss must be recognized so long as the fair value is determinable and the transaction has commercial substance according to this statement companies can no longer use the “similar productive assets” concept to account for nonmonetary exchanges at book value with no gain or loss being recognized fas 153 will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 the adoption of this statement may impact our operating results financial position or cash flows in future periods if such a nonmonetary exchange occurs 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r revises sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and focuses on accounting for sharebased payments for services by employer to employee the statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equitybased compensation at the grant date the statement does not require a certain type of valuation model and either a binomial or blackscholes model may be used the provisions of sfas 123r are effective for financial statements for fiscal periods ending after june 15 2005 we are currently evaluating the method of adoption and the impact on our operating results our future cash flows will not be impacted by the adoption of this standard see footnote 1 “stock based compensation” for further information 

  

  

 35  

in february 2005 the fasb released for public comment proposed staff position fas 19a “accounting for suspended well costs” this proposed staff position would amend fasb statement no 19 “financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies” and provides guidance about exploratory well costs to companies who use the successful efforts method of accounting the proposed position states that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized if 1 a sufficient quantity of reserved are discovered in the well to justify its completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is made in assessing the reserves and the well’s economic and operating feasibility if the exploratory well costs do not meet both of these criteria these costs should be expensed net of any salvage value additional disclosures are required to provide information about management’s evaluation of capitalized exploratory well costs in addition the staff position requires the disclosure of 1 net changes from period to period of capitalized exploratory well costs for wells that are pending the determination of proved reserves 2 the amount of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year after the completion of drilling and 3 an aging of exploratory well costs suspended for greater than one year with the number of wells it related to further the disclosures should describe the activities undertaken to evaluate the reserves and the projects the information still required to classify the associated reserves as proved and the estimated timing for completing the evaluation although this staff position is not final and has not been adopted by us we have included the additional disclosures in note 2 comments on this proposed fsp are expected by march 7 2005

results of operations 

  

2004 and 2003 compared 

  

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2004 of 884 million or 272 per share during 2003 we reported net income of 211 million or 066 per share operating income increased by 941 million compared to the prior year from 666 million to 1607 million the increase in net income and operating income was principally due to decreased operating expenses from 2003 to 2004 related to the decrease in impairments of oil and gas properties of 903 million related to the loss in 2003 of a reversionary interest in the kurten field in addition the increases in operating income and net income were due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices 

  

natural gas production revenues 

  

our average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 520 per mcf compared to 451 per mcf for the comparable period of the prior year these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 076 per mcf in 2004 and 068 per mcf in 2003 the following table excludes the unrealized gain from the change in derivative fair value of 09 million and the unrealized loss of 15 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the natural gas production revenues line item on the statement of operations 

  

   

the increase in natural gas production revenues was mainly a result of increased sales prices as well as the increase in overall production natural gas production was up slightly from the prior year and production revenues also increased from 2003 natural gas production increased slightly in all regions except the west region where the decline in production was due to lower capital spending in 2003 and continued natural decline the increases in both sales price and production resulted in an increase in natural gas production revenues of 547 million 

  

 37  

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

  

   

the decrease in brokered natural gas revenues of 113 million combined with the decline in brokered natural gas cost of 109 million resulted in a decrease to the brokered natural gas margin of 05 million 

  

 38  

crude oil and condensate revenues 

  

our average total company realized crude oil sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 3155 per bbl compared to 2955 per bbl for 2003 these prices include the realized impact of derivative instruments which reduced these prices by 898 per bbl in 2004 and 141 per bbl in 2003 the following table excludes the unrealized loss from the change in derivative fair value of 29 million and 19 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively these unrealized changes in fair value have been included in the crude oil and condensate revenues line item on the statement of operations 

  

   

the decline in crude oil production is due to emphasis on natural gas in the gulf coast drilling program along with the natural decline of existing production in south louisiana the increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue decrease of 200 million 

  

  

 39  

other operating revenues 

  

other operating revenues decreased 37 million this change was primarily a result of decreases in natural gas transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

operating expenses 

  

total costs and expenses from operations decreased 853 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 17 million this variance is due to a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility offset somewhat by an increase in prime rates average daily borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the year were 05 million in 2004 which is a decrease from 07 million in 2003 our other remaining debt is at fixed interest rates 

  

income tax expense 

  

income tax expense increased 352 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax net income 

  

  

 40  

2003 and 2002 compared 

  

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2003 of 211 million or 066 per share during the corresponding period of 2002 we reported net income of 161 million or 051 per share operating income increased by 175 million compared to the comparable period of the prior year the increase in net income and operating income was substantially due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices 

  

natural gas production revenues 

  

the average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 451 per mcf due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by 068 per mcf the following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 these amounts have been included in the natural gas production revenues line item on the statement of operations see item 7a for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

  

   

the decline in natural gas production is due substantially to the size and timing of gulf coast and west drilling programs along with the natural decline of existing production the increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 1012 million

crude oil and condensate revenues 

  

the average total company realized crude oil sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 2955 per bbl for the year ended december 31 2003 due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by 141 per bbl the following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 these amounts have been included in the crude oil and condensate revenues line item on the statement of operations see item 7a for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

  

   

the decline in crude oil production is due substantially to the size and timing of the gulf coast drilling program along with the natural decline of existing production the increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 146 million 

  

  

 43  

other operating revenues 

  

other operating revenues increased 36 million this change was a result of an increase in plant revenue transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

operating expenses 

  

total costs and expenses from operations increased 1501 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 24 million this variance is due to the combination of a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility as well as a decline in interest rates 

  

income tax expense 

  

income tax expense increased 74 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax net income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

oil and gas prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile 

  

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 

  

our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of increases in prices please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

  

derivative instruments and hedging activity 

  

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production at december 31 2004 we had 15 cash flow hedges open 7 natural gas price collar arrangements one crude oil collar arrangement and 7 natural gas price swap arrangements additionally we had two crude oil financial instruments open at december 31 2004 that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 at december 31 2004 a 288 million 178 million net of tax unrealized loss was recorded to other comprehensive income along with a 384 million derivative liability and a 29 million derivative receivable the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges that is effective is initially recorded to other comprehensive income the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of all other derivatives is recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate 

  

  

 45  

the following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line item in operating revenues 

  

   

assuming no change in commodity prices after december 31 2004 we would reclassify to earnings over the next 12 months 178 million in aftertax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives this reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions currently not reflected in earnings at december 31 2004 related to anticipated 2005 production 

  

hedges on production  swaps 

  

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these derivatives are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures under our revolving credit agreement the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 100 of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by these cash flow hedges during 2004 natural gas price swaps covered 29617 mmcf or 41 of our gas production fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of 504 per mcf 

  

at december 31 2004 we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering 2005 production as follows 

  

   

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 these financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date at december 31 2004 we had two open crude oil swap arrangements with an unrealized net loss of 55 million recognized in operating revenues 

  

  

 46  

hedges on production  options 

  

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us during 2004 natural gas price collars covered 22954 mmcf of our gas production or 32 of our gas production with a weighted average floor of 478 per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of 606 per mcf 

  

at december 31 2004 we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our 2005 production as follows 

  

   

at december 31 2004 we had one open crude oil price collar contract covering our 2005 production as follows 

  

   

we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

  

cabot oil  gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration development acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties located in north america the five principal areas of operation are the texas and louisiana gulf coast rocky mountains anadarko basin appalachian basin and the gas basin of western canada in 2003 we initiated limited operations in canada operationally we have regional offices located in the gulf coast region the western region which is comprised of the rocky mountains and midcontinent areas the eastern region and canada 

  

in 2003 energy commodity prices remained strong throughout the year we leveraged the strong price environment to pay down debt and put cabot in a financial position to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities at december 31 2003 our debt to total capital ratio was 43 down from 51 at the end of 2002 our production level in 2003 was down slightly from 2002 the year gas and oil production reached the highest annual level in our history we produced 890 bcfe or 2438 mmcfe per day this year compared to 911 bcfe or 2497 mmcfe per day in 2002 to continue to take advantage of the unusually strong price environment we layered in oil and gas hedge instruments throughout 2003 to cover production in 2003 2004 and to a lesser extent 2005 at december 31 2003 76 and 72 of our natural gas and crude oil anticipated production respectively is hedged for 2004 for 2005 we have hedged 16 of our anticipated natural gas we do not have any open positions on anticipated 2005 crude oil production our decision to hedge this production fits with our risk management strategy and will allow the company to lock in the benefit of high commodity prices our 2003 realized natural gas price was 451 per mcf compared to a 2002 price of 302 our realized crude oil price was 2955 per bbl compared to a 2002 price of 2379 our average hedged prices on natural gas and crude oil for 2004 anticipated production are expected to be higher than comparable prices realized from hedging in 2003 

  

net income of 211 million or 066 per share exceeded last year by 50 million or 015 per share net operating revenues increased by 1556 million or 44 due to strong commodity prices the year over year increase in net income was achieved despite the noncash pretax impairment charges of 938 million and the 68 million impact of a cumulative effect of accounting change the pretax noncash impairment charges consist of 879 million related to the liquidation of a limited partnership interest in the kurten field and 59 million related to a field in the east the cumulative effect of accounting change is related to a 68 million charge from the adoption of sfas 143 these charges were partially offset by a pretax gain of 122 million recognized primarily on the sale of nonstrategic oil and gas properties 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 we drilled 173 gross wells with a success rate of 89 compared to 108 gross wells with a success rate of 93 for the comparable period of the prior year our 2003 capital and exploration spending was 1882 million compared to 1263 million in 2002 we concentrated our 2003 capital spending program on projects balancing acceptable risk with the strongest economics in the past we have used a portion of the cash flow from our longlived eastern and midcontinent natural gas reserves to fund our exploration and development efforts in the gulf coast canada and rocky mountain areas in 2003 certain nonstrategic assets were sold in the east region despite this divestiture production increased in this region as a result of the drilling program and infrastructure enhancements our growth plans for the east region have been redefined for 2004 accordingly the east will join the gulf coast and rocky mountain areas as a focal point of value enhancement efforts through accretive reserve and production growth in 2004 in 2004 we plan to spend 2074 million and drill 276 gross wells 

  

our proved reserves totaled approximately 1142 bcfe at december 31 2003 of which 94 was natural gas this reserve level was down slightly from 1171 bcfe at december 31 2002 due to 534 bcfe of proved reserve asset sales 

  

the following table presents certain information as of december 31 2003 

  

     

gulf coast region 

  

our exploration development and production activities in the gulf coast region are primarily concentrated in south louisiana south texas and the gulf of mexico a regional office in houston manages operations principal producing intervals are in the miocene and frio age formations in louisiana and the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in texas at depths ranging from 3000 to 20500 feet capital and exploration expenditures were 1116 million for 2003 or 59 of our total 2003 capital and exploration expenditures and 690 million for 2002 for 2004 we have budgeted 879 million of our total budget for capital and exploration expenditures in the region our 2004 gulf coast drilling program will emphasize impact exploration opportunities both on and offshore augmented by development activity in our focus areas of south texas and coastal louisiana including properties acquired in the cody acquisition 

  

in 2003 we drilled 41 wells 201 net in the gulf coast region of which 23 wells 116 net were development wells in 2004 we plan to drill 33 wells we had 747 wells 5041 net in the gulf coast region as of december 31 2003 of which 562 wells are operated by us average daily production in 2003 was 1241 mmcfe compared to 1270 mmcfe in 2002 the decline is the result of lower production from our properties in south louisiana offset partially by increased production from the coastal texas area at december 31 2003 we had 2246 bcfe of proved reserves 76 natural gas in the gulf coast region which represented 20 of our total proved reserves 

  

our principal markets for gulf coast region natural gas are in the industrialized gulf coast area and the northeastern united states our marketing subsidiary cabot oil  gas marketing corporation purchases all the natural gas production from our operated wells in the gulf coast region the marketing subsidiary sells the natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies 

  

currently approximately 60 of our natural gas sales volumes in the gulf coast region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one to three years the remaining 40 of our sales volumes are sold at indexbased prices under shortterm agreements the gulf coast properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets 

  

we currently also produce and market approximately 7100 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the gulf coast region at market responsive prices 

  

western region 

  

our activities in the western region are managed by a regional office in denver at december 31 2003 we had 4257 bcfe of proved reserves 96 natural gas in the western region constituting 37 of our total proved reserves 

  

rocky mountains 

  

our rocky mountains activities are concentrated in the green river basin of wyoming and paradox basin in colorado at december 31 2003 we had 2328 bcfe of proved reserves capital and exploration expenditures in the rocky mountains were 223 million for 2003 or 12 of our total capital and exploration expenditures and 259 million for 2002 current year spending includes 109 million for drilling activity and 94 million of dry hole expense and geophysical and geological procedures for 2004 we have budgeted 299 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area 

  

we had 505 wells 2261 net in the rocky mountains area as of december 31 2003 of which 262 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in the rocky mountains area are in the almond frontier dakota and honaker trail formations at depths ranging from 9000 to 13500 feet average net daily production in the rocky mountains during 2003 was 403 mmcfe 

  

in 2003 we drilled 19 wells 89 net in the rocky mountains of which 15 wells 67 net were development and extension wells in 2004 we plan to drill 26 wells 

  

midcontinent 

  

our midcontinent activities are concentrated in the anadarko basin in southwestern kansas oklahoma and the panhandle of texas capital and exploration expenditures were 112 million for 2003 or 6 of our total 2003 capital and exploration expenditures and 82 million for 2002 for 2004 we have budgeted 175 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the area 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had 618 wells 4309 net in the midcontinent area of which 490 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in the midcontinent are in the chase morrow red fork and chester formations at depths ranging from 1500 to 14000 feet average net daily production in 2003 was 280 mmcfe at december 31 2003 we had 1929 bcfe of proved reserves 97 natural gas in the midcontinent area 17 of our total proved reserves 

  

in 2003 we drilled 15 wells 116 net in the midcontinent all of which were development wells in 2004 we plan to drill 30 wells 

  

our principal markets for western region natural gas are in the northwestern and midwestern united states cabot oil  gas marketing purchases all of our natural gas production in the western region the marketing subsidiary sells the natural gas to power generators natural gas processors local distribution companies industrial customers and marketing companies 

  

currently approximately 75 of our natural gas production in the western region is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one to three years at indexbased prices another 23 of the natural gas production is sold under shortterm arrangements at indexbased prices and the remaining 2 is sold under certain fixedprice contracts the western region properties are connected to the majority of the midwestern and northwestern interstate and intrastate pipelines affording us access to multiple markets 

  

we currently also produce and market approximately 500 barrels of crude oilcondensate per day in the western region at market responsive prices 

  

eastern region 

  

our eastern activities are concentrated in west virginia ohio and virginia in this region our assets include a large undeveloped acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage capacity capital and exploration expenditures were 406 million for 2003 or 22 of our total 2003 capital spending and 221 million for 2002 for 2004 we have budgeted 579 million for capital and exploration expenditures in the region 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 2418 wells 22374 net of which 2334 wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include the big lime weir berea devonian shale and oriskany formations at depths primarily ranging from 1500 to 9000 feet average net daily production in 2003 was 514 mmcfe while natural gas production volumes from eastern reservoirs are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states the productive life of eastern reserves is relatively long at december 31 2003 we had 4918 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in the eastern region constituting 43 of our total proved reserves this region is managed from our office in charleston west virginia 

  

in 2003 we drilled 98 wells 914 net in the eastern region of which 92 wells 862 net were development wells in 2004 we plan to drill 179 wells 

  

ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2003 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system 

  

we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 3 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the storage fields also enable us to periodically increase the volume of natural gas that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver solely from our production in the eastern region the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations 

  

in 2003 we purchased 52 miles of pipeline which enables us to deliver gas in a more efficient manner from an existing producing field additionally this acquisition will allow us to deliver gas to certain industrial facilities in west virginia 

  

in addition during most of 2003 we owned and operated two brine treatment plants that processed and treated waste fluid generated during the drilling completion and production of oil and gas wells the first plant near franklin pennsylvania began operating in 1985 and provided services primarily to other oil and gas producers in southwestern new york eastern ohio and western pennsylvania in april 1998 we acquired a second brine treatment plant in indiana pennsylvania that had been in existence since 1987 effective november 1 2003 we sold this wholly owned subsidiary franklin brine corporation for 34 million in cash and no longer own or operate any brine treatment facilities 

  

the principal markets for our eastern region natural gas are in the northeastern united states cabot oil  gas marketing purchases our natural gas production in the eastern region as well as production from local thirdparty producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of natural gas for resale the marketing subsidiary sells natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system 

  

approximately 65 of our natural gas sales volume in the eastern region is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one to two years in addition spot market sales are made under monthtomonth contracts while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts approximately 2 of eastern production is sold on fixed price contracts that typically renew annually 

  

risk management 

  

from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain financial instruments called derivatives to manage price risks associated with our production in all of our regions while there are many different types of derivatives available in 2003 we primarily employed natural gas and oil price swap and collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor 

  

we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please read management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – commodity price swaps and options for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives 

  

reserves 

  

current reserves 

  

the following table presents our estimated proved reserves at december 31 2003 

  

     

the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum engineers for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those filed by us with other federal agencies our reserves are sensitive to natural gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of december 2003 

  

there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing therefore the reserve information in this form 10k represents only estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas than can not be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates of different engineers may vary in addition results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced

competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery records affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers in the eastern region who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we also believe that our competitive position in the eastern region is enhanced by the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas companies we also actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and other resources particularly in the western and gulf coast regions 

  

other business matters 

  

major customer 

  

in 2003 approximately 11 of our total sales were made to one customer in 2002 approximately 14 of our total sales were made to one customer in 2002 this customer operated certain properties in which we have interests in the gulf coast and purchased all of the production from these wells this customer would resell the natural gas and oil to third parties with whom we would deal directly if the customer either ceased to exist or stopped buying our portion of the production in 2001 we had no sales to any customer that exceeded 10 of our total gross revenues 

  

seasonality 

  

demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months 

  

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 

  

exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected materially differently by these regulations than others in the industry 

  

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation 

  

federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas which includes all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all producers such as us a “blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity” authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect 

  

our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of gas to the primary role of gas transporters order no 436 generally required interstate pipelines to become “open access” transporters of natural gas thereby requiring pipelines to transport gas supplies owned by others in competition with their own supplies order no 636 further required that interstate pipelines cease making “bundled” sales of natural gas ie gas sales at a single price that includes both the cost of the gas and the cost of its delivery and further required that pipelines “unbundle” their gathering and transmission services order no 637 has implemented additional requirements to increase the transparency of pricing for pipeline services including requiring pipelines to implement imbalance management services for shippers restricting the ability of pipelines to impose penalties for imbalances overruns and noncompliance with operational flow orders and implementing a number of new reporting requirements the ferc has also developed rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates and implemented standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis 

  

in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 

  

certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dot’s final regulations implementing the act became effective in february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission pipeline facilities within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter 

  

we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward federal deregulation or “lighterhanded” regulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted 

  

federal regulation of petroleum 

  

our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year these regulations 

  

have generally been approved on judicial review every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry the first such review has been completed and on december 14 2000 the ferc reaffirmed the current index we are not able to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these relatively new federal regulations or of the periodic review by the ferc of the index 

  

environmental regulations 

  

general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 

  

the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 

  

outer continental shelf lands act the federal outer continental shelf lands act ocsla and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto impose a variety of regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees permits and other parties operating on the outer continental shelf specific design and operational standards may apply to outer continental shelf vessels rigs platforms vehicles and structures violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution we believe that we substantially comply with the ocsla and its regulations 

  

solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination 

  

we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today 

  

superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the “superfund” law imposes liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall within cercla’s definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed 

  

oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term “waters of the united states” has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 

  

clean water act  the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations 

  

clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 cabot oil  gas had 336 active employees we recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we maintain with our employees overall we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory the company and its employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 

  

website access to company reports 

  

we make available free of charge through our website wwwcabotogcom  our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission information on our website is not a part of this report 

  

other 

  

our profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond our control such as natural gas and crude oil prices please see items 7 and 7a we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses our business involves a variety of operating risks including blowouts cratering explosions and fires mechanical problems uncontrolled flows of oil natural gas or well fluids formations with abnormal pressures pollution and other environmental risks and natural disasters we conduct operations in shallow offshore areas which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather 

  

our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures any of these events could result in loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east at december 31 2003 we owned or operated approximately 3200 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems throughout the united states as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe may require repair replacement or additional maintenance and we schedule this maintenance as appropriate 

  

the sale of our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control the factors include the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities our failure to access these facilities and obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business all known liabilities are fully accrued based on management’s best estimate of the potential loss in management’s opinion final judgments or settlements if any which may be awarded in connection with any one or more of these suits and claims would not have a significant impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows of any period 

  

wyoming royalty litigation 

  

in june 2000 we were sued by two overriding royalty owners in wyoming state court for unspecified damages the plaintiffs requested class certification under the wyoming rules of civil procedure and alleged that we improperly deducted costs of production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons additionally the suit claimed that we failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of the deductions taken from royalties at a mediation held in april 2003 the plaintiffs in this case claimed total damages of 95 million plus attorney fees we were recently able to settle the case and the state district court judge recently entered his order approving the settlement the settlement was for a total of 225 million the class included all private fee royalty and overriding royalty owners of the company in the state of wyoming except those in the suit discussed below and one owner who opted out of the settlement it also includes provisions for the method of valuation of gas for royalty payment purposes going forward and for reporting of royalty payments which should prevent further litigation of these issues by the class members 

  

in january 2002 13 overriding royalty owners sued the company in wyoming federal district court the plaintiffs in the federal case have made the same general claims pertaining to deductions from their overriding royalty as the plaintiffs in the wyoming state court case but have not asked for class certification that case is on hold awaiting a wyoming supreme court decision on two certified questions 

  

although management believes that a number of our defenses are supported by wyoming case law two letter decisions handed down by state district court judges in other cases do not support certain of the defenses in one of the cases the case has been settled so no order will be entered in the other case a generic order has been entered adopting the letter decision by reference it is not known what effect if any the decision will have on the pending case in addition in 2000 a district court judge’s decision supported our defenses and that decision was recently orally confirmed by another state district court judge accordingly there is a split of authority concerning the interpretation of the reporting penalty provisions of the wyoming royalty payment act which will need to be resolved by the wyoming supreme court 

  

as noted above the judge agreed to certify two questions of state law for decision by the wyoming state supreme court the wyoming state supreme court has agreed to decide both questions and these decisions should dispose of important issues in the pending federal case the federal judge refused however to certify a question relating to the issue of the proper calculation of damages for failure to provide certain information required by statute on overriding royalty owner check stubs that had been decided adversely to our position in the state district court letter decision after the federal judge’s refusal to certify this issue the plaintiffs reduced the damages they were claiming based upon the plaintiffs expert witness report filed in march 2003 the plaintiffs are now claiming 21 million in total damages which can be broken down into 157 million for alleged violations of the check stub reporting statute and the remainder for all other damages in the opinion of our outside counsel brown drew  massey llp the likelihood of the plaintiffs recovering the stated damages for violation of the check stub reporting statute is remote 

  

we are vigorously defending the case we have a reserve that management believes is adequate to provide for the potential liability based on its estimate of the probable outcome of this case should circumstances change the potential impact may materially affect quarterly or annual results of operations and cash flows however management does not believe it would materially impact our financial position 

  

west virginia royalty litigation 

  

in december 2001 we were sued by two royalty owners in west virginia state court for an unspecified amount of damages the plaintiffs have requested class certification under the west virginia rules of civil procedure and allege that we failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas produced that we have taken improper 

  

deductions from the royalty and has failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of deductions taken from the royalty the plaintiffs have also claimed that they are entitled to a 18th royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement that we reached with columbia gas transmission corporation in the 1995 columbia gas transmission corporation bankruptcy proceeding 

  

we had removed the lawsuit to federal court however in february 2003 we received an order remanding the lawsuit back to state court discovery and pleadings necessary to place the class certification issue before the court have been ongoing a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was held on october 20 2003 and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were submitted to the court on december 5 2003 the trial is currently scheduled for march 29 2004 based on the current status of discovery the trial date is likely to be continued at a later date 

  

the investigation into this claim continues and it is in the discovery phase we are vigorously defending the case we have reserves we believe are adequate to provide for these potential liabilities based on our estimate of the probable outcome of this matter should circumstances change the potential impact may materially affect quarterly or annual results of operations and cash flows however management does not believe it would materially impact our financial position 

  

texas title litigation 

  

on january 6 2003 we were served with plaintiffs’ second amended original petition in romeo longoria et al v exxon mobil corporation et al in the 79th judicial district court of brooks county texas the plaintiffs allege that they are the rightful owners of a onehalf undivided mineral interest in and to certain lands in brooks county texas as cody energy llc the company acquired certain leases and wells from wynncrosby 1996 ltd in 1997 and 1998 and the company subsequently acquired a 320 acre lease from hector and gloria lopez in 2001 the plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the rightful owners of an undivided interest in the surface and minerals and all improvements on the lands on which the company acquired these leases the plaintiffs also assert claims for trespass to try title action to remove a cloud on the title failure to properly account for royalty fraud trespass conversion all for unspecified actual and exemplary damages the trial date of may 19 2003 was cancelled and a new trial date has not been set we have not had the opportunity to conduct discovery in this matter we estimate that production revenue from this field since its predecessor cody energy llc acquired title and since we acquired its lease is approximately 13 million the carrying value of this property is approximately 35 million codefendants shell oil company and shell western ep have filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ causes of action on multiple grounds we were in the process of joining in that motion when the plaintiffs’ attorneys asked permission from the court to withdraw from the representation the court granted that request and new attorneys for some but not all of the plaintiffs have recently entered the case the motion for summary judgment was reset and a hearing held in december 2003 the court has permitted plaintiffs additional time to gather more information and it is anticipated that the court will hold a second hearing on the motion we have joined in the motion 

  

although the investigation into this claim has just begun we intend to vigorously defend the case management cannot currently determine the likelihood or range of any potential outcome

the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 

  

statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read forwardlooking information on page 30 

  

we operate in one segment natural gas and oil exploration and development 

  

overview 

  

cabot oil  gas is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in north america our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to large multiwell repeatable drilling programs and our technical skills our program is disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 

  

at cabot there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital these include drilling opportunities acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment depending on circumstances we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rateofreturn approach our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 

  

our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years throughout 2002 and 2003 the nymex futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices our realized natural gas price was 451 per mcf in 2003 to lock in these high prices we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps these financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment 

  

commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes and future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success 

  

the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of 2002 and 2003 “index” represents the henry hub index price per mmbtu the “2002” and “2003” price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar or swap arrangements 

  

   

prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market continued to rise in 2002 and through 2003 the tables below contain the nymex average crude oil price index and our realized per bbl crude oil prices by month for 2002 and 2003 

  

   

we reported earnings of 066 per share or 211 million for 2003 this is up from the 051 per share or 161 million reported in 2002 the stronger price environment was the driving factor in this improvement prices including the impact of the hedge arrangements rose 49 for natural gas and 24 for oil substantially offsetting this positive price impact was an aftertax impairment of 544 million related to our kurten field see limited partnership for discussion of the impairment and a slight decline in natural gas and crude oil production 

  

we drilled 173 gross wells with a success rate of 89 in 2003 compared to 108 gross wells with a 93 success rate in 2002 total capital and exploration expenditures increased 619 million to 1882 million in 2003 compared to 1263 million for 2002 in previous years our capital spending excluding major acquisitions used substantially all of our operating cash flow in 2003 our capital and exploration expenditures were under this level allowing us to reduce debt by 950 million our strategy in 2004 is anticipated to remain consistent with 2003 we believe our operating cash flow in 2004 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of 2074 million and again provide excess cash flow 

  

we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit balancing the higher risk higher reward exploration opportunities with an extensive development program and from synergistic acquisitions we plan to remain disciplined in our capital program while providing for growth potential we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term 

  

the preceding paragraphs discussing our strategic pursuits and goals contain forwardlooking information please read forwardlooking information on page 30 

  

financial condition 

  

capital resources and liquidity 

  

our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and assetbased borrowings supported by our oil and gas reserves the level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors including the price of crude oil and natural gas and our ability to control and reduce costs demand for crude oil and natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however demand and prices moved higher strengthening from the first half of 2002 into the summer and continued to strengthen through 2003 prices in 2003 were the result of a higher demand associated with colder than normal winter temperatures combined with higher storage injection demand in the second and third quarters 

  

our primary source of cash during 2003 was from funds generated from operations and proceeds from the sale of certain nonstrategic assets cash was primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures reduce debt and pay dividends we had a net cash outflow of 09 million during 2003 see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

  

   

cash flow discussion and analysis 

  

   

   

   

the available credit line under our revolving credit facility currently 250 million is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the bank’s petroleum engineer and other assets at december 31 2003 there was no outstanding balance due on the revolving credit facility the revolving term of the credit facility ends in october 2006 we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity management believes that we have the ability to finance through existing available capacity or new debt or equity offerings if necessary our capital requirements including acquisitions 

  

in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings we have a period of three months to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line with a requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down onethird of the excess during each of the three months 

  

our 2004 interest expense is expected to be approximately 200 million 

  

from time to time we enter into financial instruments to hedge our natural gas and crude oil production prices while the marktomarket positions under the hedging agreements will fluctuate with commodity prices as a producer our liquidity exposure due to its outstanding derivative instruments tends to increase when commodity prices increase consequently we are most likely to have the largest unfavorable marktomarket position in a high commodity price environment at december 31 2003 the aggregate marktomarket liability under the aforementioned hedging agreements was 385 million 

  

capitalization 

  

our capitalization information is as follows 

  

   

for the year ended december 31 2003 we paid dividends of 50 million on our common stock a regular dividend of 004 per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company 

  

capital and exploration expenditures 

  

on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions with cash generated from operations we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

  

the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2003 

  

    

we plan to drill 276 gross wells in 2004 compared with 173 gross wells drilled in 2003 this 2004 drilling program includes approximately 2074 million in total capital and exploration expenditures up from 1882 million in 2003 we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 

  

there are many factors that impact our depreciation depletion and amortization rate these include reserve additions and revisions development costs impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period in 2004 management expects an increase in our depreciation depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and reserve revisions on certain wells in south louisiana this change may result in an increase of depreciation depletion and amortization of 10 to 15 percent greater than 2003 levels this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december 31 2003

from time to time management discloses discretionary cash flow and net income and earnings per share excluding selected items these nongaap financial measure calculations may be presented in earnings releases of the company furnished in form 8k to the securities and exchange commission along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measure for the period 

  

discretionary cash flow is defined as net income plus noncash charges and exploration expense discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities pay dividends and service debt discretionary cash flow is presented based on management’s belief that this nongaap measure is helpful to investors when comparing our cash flow with the cash flow of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net income 

  

net income excluding selected items and earnings per share excluding selected items are presented based on management’s belief that these nongaap measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results additionally this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods net income and earnings per share excluding selected items are not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income and earnings per share as defined by gaap 

  

potential impact of our critical accounting policies 

  

readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place the three most significant policies are discussed below 

  

successful efforts method of accounting 

  

we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including seismic purchases and processing exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred an exploratory dry hole could have a significant effect on the results of operations development costs including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 

  

we are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows this may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level 

  

that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field we determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields the impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value 

  

revenue recognition 

  

the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue under this method revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances 

  

oil and gas reserves 

  

the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 

  

   

   

   

   

our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 

  

because these estimates depend on many assumptions all of which may substantially differ from actual results reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered in addition results of drilling testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 

  

you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices on the date of the estimate 

  

our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization expense dda is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves if the estimates of proved reserves declines the rate at which we record dda expense increases reducing net income such a decline may result from lower market prices which may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields in addition the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” 

  

carrying value of longlived assets 

  

we perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon our estimates of proved crude oil ngls and natural gas reserves future crude oil ngls and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil ngls and natural gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying amounts of its properties 

  

costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above however a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization on a composite basis based on past experience and average property lives as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining 

  

capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of the company’s future exploration program 

  

accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

  

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas 133 under sfas 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge under sfas 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas 133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations 

  

longterm employee benefit costs 

  

our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly pension and postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is management’s responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is management’s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 

  

the current benefit service costs as well as the existing liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis the discount rate is a current rate related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for highquality fixed income securities 

  

the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of december 31 2003 the assumed rate of increase was 80 the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate and reflects longterm expectations rather than current fluctuations in market conditions the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets management’s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 

  

additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

stock based compensation 

  

in accordance with current accounting standards there are two alternative methods that can be used to account for stockbased compensation the first method is the intrinsic value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess if any of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock the second method is the fair value method under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period currently we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method 

  

other issues and contingencies 

  

corporate income tax  we generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounted to 052 per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992 a number of wells drilled in the eastern region and rocky mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale was 109 per mmbtu in 2002 in 1995 and 1996 we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits resulting in revenues of 20 million in 2002 the tax credit wells were repurchased in december 2002 and therefore no monetization revenue was realized in 2003 see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 

  

regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 business for a discussion of these regulations 

  

restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company’s various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and the notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at december 31 2003 we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and the notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 

  

limited partnership as part of the cody acquisition we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field as general partner of a partnership and as an operator prior to the liquidation of the partnership and the divestiture of our interest in the field we had an interest of approximately 25 including a one percent interest in the partnership the liquidation and divestiture was effective july 31 and november 1 respectively of 2003 under the partnership agreement we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would have brought our ultimate interest to 50 upon the limited partner reaching payout under the partnership agreement the limited partner had the option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership effective february 13 2003 the kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partner’s election in connection with the liquidation an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets based on the receipt of the appraisal in february 2003 we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field the limited partner’s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation we performed an impairment review which resulted in an aftertax charge of approximately 544 million this impairment charge is reflected in the 2003 statement of operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows 

  

operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks any of these events could result in loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate during the past few years we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the gulf coast where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 

  

commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 

  

the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2001 the fasb approved for issuance statement of financial accounting standards sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 143 establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets including 1 the timing of the liability recognition 2 initial measurement of the liability 3 allocation of asset retirement cost to expense 4 subsequent measurement of the liability and 5 financial statement disclosures sfas 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related longlived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method the adoption of sfas 143 resulted in 1 an increase of total liabilities because more retirement obligations are required to be recognized 2 an increase in the recognized cost of assets because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the longlived assets and 3 an increase in operating expense because of the accretion of the retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the 

  

plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells the company adopted the statement on january 1 2003 the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas 143 has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in january 2003 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” sfas 148 amends sfas 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results the provisions of sfas 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued financial interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities – an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46 or interpretation fin 46 is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin 51 “consolidated financial statements” and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of and financial reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights such entities are known as vies the interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur or both an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination at december 31 2003 we did not have any entities that would qualify for consolidation in accordance with the provisions of fin 46 therefore the adoption of fin 46 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under sfas 133 the amendments set forth in sfas 149 require that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly sfas 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 with a few exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the guidance is to be applied prospectively only the adoption of sfas 149 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances many of those instruments were previously classified as equity this statement was developed in response to concerns expressed by preparers auditors regulators investors and other users of financial statements about issuers´ classification in the statement of financial position of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity but that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the statement of financial position this statement also addresses questions about the classification of certain financial instruments that embody obligations to issue equity shares 

  

in accordance with sfas 150 companies with consolidated entities that will terminate by a specified date such as limitedlife partnerships will have to measure the liabilities for the other owners’ interests in those limitedlife entities based on the fair values of the limitedlife entities’ assets periodtoperiod changes in the liabilities are to be reported in the consolidated income statement as interest costs as a result of sfas 150 liability amounts and related interest costs may be significantly greater than the minority interests previously recognized this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

we have been made aware of an issue regarding the application of provisions of sfas 141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142  to companies in the extractive industries including oil and gas companies the issue is whether sfas 142 requires registrants to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights 

  

including both proved and unproved leasehold acquisition costs as intangible assets in the balance sheet apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs historically cabot and other oil and gas companies have included the cost of these oil and gas leasehold interests as part of oil and gas properties and provided the disclosures required by sfas no 69 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities  sfas 69  also under consideration is whether sfas 142 requires registrants to provide the additional disclosures prescribed by sfas 142 for intangible assets for costs associated with mineral rights 

  

if it is ultimately determined that sfas 142 requires us to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights from property and equipment to intangible assets management currently believes that its results of operations and financial condition would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules and impairment standards in addition costs associated with mineral rights would continue to be characterized as oil and gas property costs in our required disclosures under sfas 69 

  

at december 31 2003 we had net undeveloped leaseholds of approximately 630 million that would be classified on our balance sheet as intangible undeveloped leaseholds and developed leaseholds of approximately 3184 million net of accumulated depletion that would be classified as intangible developed leaseholds if we applied the interpretation currently being discussed 

  

on december 23 2003 the fasb issued sfas 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” an amendment of sfas 87 88 and 106 and a revision of sfas 132 this statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by sfas 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas 88 “employers’ accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits” and sfas 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” the new rules require additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans the new disclosures are effective for 2003 calendar year financial statements 

  

   

  

forwardlooking information 

  

the statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results market prices future hedging activities and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forwardlooking statements the words “expect” “project” “estimate” “believe” “anticipate” “intend” “budget” “plan” “forecast” “predict” “may” “should” “could” “will” and similar expressions are also intended to identify forwardlooking statements such statements involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to market factors market prices including regional basis differentials of natural gas and oil results for future drilling and marketing activity future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other securities and exchange commission filings should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 

  

results of operations 

  

2003 and 2002 compared 

  

net income and operating revenue 

  

we reported net income for the year ended december 31 2003 of 211 million or 066 per share during the corresponding period of 2002 we reported net income of 161 million or 051 per share operating income increased by 175 million compared to the comparable period of the prior year the increase in net income and operating income was substantially due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices 

  

natural gas production revenues 

  

the average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 451 per mcf due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by 068 per mcf the following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 these amounts have been included in the natural gas production revenues line item on the statement of operations see item 7a for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

  

   

the decline in natural gas production is due substantially to the size and timing of gulf coast and west drilling program along with the natural decline of existing production the increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 1012 million 

  

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

  

   

crude oil and condensate revenues 

  

the average total company realized crude oil sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 2955 per bbl for the year ended december 31 2003 due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by 141 per bbl the following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 these amounts have been included in the crude oil and condensate revenues line item on the statement of operations see item 7a for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

  

   

the decline in crude oil production is due substantially to the size and timing of the gulf coast drilling program along with the natural decline of existing production the increase in the realized crude oil price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue increase of 146 million 

  

other net operating revenues 

  

other operating revenues increased 36 million this change was a result of an increase in plant revenue transportation revenue and natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

operating expenses 

  

total costs and expenses from operations increased 1501 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense decreased 24 million this variance is due to the combination of a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility as well as a decline in interest rates 

  

income tax expense 

  

income tax expense increased 74 million due to a comparable increase in our pretax net income 

  

2002 and 2001 compared 

  

net income and operating revenue 

  

during 2002 we reported net income of 161 million or 051 per share operating income decreased 463 million and operating revenues decreased 933 million in 2002 the decrease in operating revenues was mainly a result of the 806 million decline in natural gas sales due to the 31 decrease in natural gas prices and the 320 million decrease in brokered natural gas sales revenue which was also a result of lower prices natural gas revenue and our realized price were reduced by 06 million due to hedges in place during 2002 see further discussion in item 7a these decreases were partially offset by an increase in crude oil revenue of 200 million due to a 50 increase in the volume of crude oil produced operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 

  

natural gas production revenues 

  

the average total company realized natural gas production sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 302 per mcf due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by 001 per mcf the following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2002 and 2001 these amounts have been included in the natural gas production revenues line item on the statement of operations see item 7a for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

  

   

the decline in natural gas production is due substantially to the size and timing of gulf coast and west drilling program along with the natural decline of existing production the increase in the realized natural gas price combined with the decline in production resulted in a net revenue decrease of 787 million 

  

brokered natural gas revenue and cost 

  

   

crude oil and condensate revenues 

  

the average total company realized crude oil sales price including the realized impact of derivative instruments was 2379 per bbl for the year ended december 31 2002 due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by 181 per bbl the following table excludes the unrealized impact of the change in derivative fair value for the year ended december 31 2002 and 2001 these amounts have been included in the crude oil and condensate revenues line item on the statement of operations see item 7a for a discussion of the realized and unrealized impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues 

  

   

the increase in crude oil production is a result of our 2000 and 2001 drilling success in south louisiana and the acquisition of cody company this increase was slightly offset by a decline in crude oil prices which resulted in a net increase in crude oil revenue of 208 million 

  

other net operating revenues 

  

other operating revenues decreased 07 million to 64 million in 2002 we provided for payout liabilities on certain properties not operated by us and certain estimated potential legal settlements 

  

operating expenses 

  

total costs and expenses from operations decreased 468 million or 13 from 2001 due primarily to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

interest expense 

  

interest expense increased 44 million due to the full year impact of the incremental debt used to partially fund the cody acquisition in august 2001 interest expense on the credit facility was down slightly due both to lower levels of borrowings and lower interest rates 

  

income tax expense 

  

income tax expense was down 198 million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax our effective tax rate decreased slightly in 2002 reflecting a shift of activity between states 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

oil and gas prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile 

  

prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 

  

our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of increases in prices please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 

  

derivative instruments and hedging activity 

  

periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production at december 31 2003 we had 32 cash flow hedges open 15 natural gas price collar arrangements and 17 natural gas price swap arrangements additionally we had four crude oil financial instruments and one natural gas financial instrument open at december 31 2003 that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 at december 31 2003 a 339 million 210 million net of tax unrealized loss was recorded to other comprehensive income along with a 396 million derivative liability and a 12 million derivative receivable the change in derivative fair value for the current and prior periods have been included as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue as appropriate 

  

the following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line item in operating revenues 

  

   

assuming no change in commodity prices after december 31 2003 we would reclassify to earnings over the next 12 months 203 million in aftertax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives this reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions at december 31 2003 related to anticipated 2004 production 

  

hedges on production  swaps 

  

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production these derivatives are not held for trading purposes under these price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures under our revolving credit agreement the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 80 of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by the hedges during 2003 natural gas price swaps covered 34806 mmcf or 48 of our gas production fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of 449 per mcf 

  

at december 31 2003 we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering our 2004 and 2005 production as follows 

  

   

from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 these financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date at december 31 2003 we had four open crude oil swap arrangements and one natural gas swap arrangement with an unrealized net loss of 26 million and 08 million respectively recognized in operating revenues 

  

hedges on production  options 

  

throughout 2002 and 2003 we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of natural gas and crude oil collars under the collar arrangements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us 

  

during 2003 natural gas price collars covered 16136 mmcf or 22 of our gas production with a weighted average floor of 446 per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of 541 per mcf additionally during 2003 we had crude oil price collars which covered 362 mbbls or 25 of our production with a weighted average floor of 2475 per bbl and a weighted average ceiling of 2886 per bbl these crude oil contracts expired in june 2003 

  

at december 31 2003 we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our 2004 and 2005 production as follows 

  

   

at december 31 2003 we have no open crude oil price collar arrangements to cover future production 

  

we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 

  

the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities see forwardlooking information on page 30

item 1 business

overview

     cabot oil  gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the
exploration development acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties
located in four principal areas of the united states

 the texas and louisiana gulf coast
 the rocky mountains
 the midcontinent or anadarko basin
 the eastern area of the united states

     operationally we have regional offices located in three regions  the gulf
coast region the western region which is comprised of the rocky mountains and
midcontinent areas and the eastern region

     in 2002 our natural gas and oil production reached its highest annual
level in our history we produced 911 bcfe or 2497 mmcfe per day this year
this is a 12 improvement over 2001 when we produced 811 bcfe or 2223 mmcfe
per day of this 12 growth 8 was associated with the full year impact of
properties acquired from cody company in august 2001 the remaining 4 was a
result of drilling during the past two years primarily in south louisiana
commodity prices were much softer in 2002 however and despite the increases in
production revenue and net income levels decreased in 2002 compared to 2001
our 2002 realized natural gas price was 302 per mcf down 31 from 2001 due to
a decline in natural gas prices our realized crude oil price was 2379 per
bbl down 4 from 2001 primarily due to the impact of crude oil collars which
reduced our realized price by 181 per bbl

     net income of 161 million or 051 per share was under last years record
of 471 million or 156 per share lower commodity prices were the primary
reason for this years revenue decline prices have recovered somewhat during
the fourth quarter and into early 2003 in order to reduce the risk of price
declines in 2003 we have collar and swap arrangements in place on 51 of our
anticipated natural gas production and 42 31 relates to oil range swaps of
our anticipated oil production as of december 31 2002

     in 2002 93 of the wells that we drilled were successful drilling was
successful on 67 of our 2002 exploration wells as we tested new ideas and
worked on building a foundation for the future this was an improvement over an
87 overall success rate in 2001 and a 40 success rate on exploration wells
our 2002 capital and exploration spending was 1263 million including 196
million for seismic data and lease acquisition this spending will support our
exploration and development drilling programs in 2003 and beyond as we entered
2002 energy commodity prices softened from the unusually high level enjoyed in
2001 we concentrated our 2002 capital spending program on projects balancing
acceptable risk with the strongest economics as in the past we will use a
portion of the cash flow from our longlived eastern and midcontinent natural
gas reserves to fund our exploration and development efforts in the gulf coast
and rocky mountain areas we believe these two core producing areas offer more
value through accretive reserve and production growth and higher rates of
return on equity this strategy remains in place for 2003 in 2003 we plan to
spend 1539 million and drill 180 gross wells

     our proved reserves totaled approximately 12 tcfe at december 31 2002 of
which 91 was natural gas this reserve level rose just slightly above the prior
year end in a year when production rose 12 while the level of total program
spending was 76 below 2001 highlighting the success of the 2002 program was
redfish bay in the gulf coast and double eagle field in colorado

      this document refers to amounts that include only acreage or production
      that is owned by cabot oil  gas and produced to its interest less
      royalties and production due others net wells represents our working
      interest share of each well

gulf coast region

     our exploration development and production activities in the gulf coast
region are concentrated in south louisiana and south texas a regional office in
houston manages operations principal producing intervals are in the frio
wilcox and vicksburg formations in texas and the miocene and frio age formations
in louisiana at depths ranging from 3000 to 20500 feet capital and
exploration expenditures were 690 million for 2002 or 55 of our total 2002
capital and exploration expenditures and 3521 million for 2001 the cash and
common stock portion of the august 2001 acquisition of cody company accounted
for 2312 million of this amount which did not include a noncash deferred tax
grossup of 780 million see limited partnership on page 29 for discussion
related to the cody acquisition our drilling and acquisition program has
increased average daily production in the region from 156 mmcfe per day in
1994 when we acquired our first gulf coast properties from washington energy
to 1270 mmcfe per day in 2002 of this production rate 358 mmcfe per day was
associated with the cody properties and the remaining primarily represents
production growth from our drilling activity for 2003 we have budgeted 881
million 57 of our total 2003 budget for capital and exploration expenditures
in the region our 2003 gulf coast drilling program will emphasize impact
exploration opportunities both on and off shore augmented by development
activity in our focus areas of south texas and coastal louisiana including
properties acquired in the cody acquisition

     we had 900 wells 5490 net in the gulf coast region as of december 31
2002 of which 714 wells are operated by us average net daily production in
2002 was 1270 mmcfe up from 979 mmcfe in 2001 due both to drilling success in
south louisiana and to the cody acquisition at december 31 2002 we had 2854
bcfe of proved reserves 69 natural gas in the gulf coast region which
represented 24 of our total proved reserves

     in 2002 we drilled 24 wells 12 net in the gulf coast region of which 16
wells 8 net were development wells the south louisiana etouffee prospect and
our 2001 discoveries in the augen field in south louisiana and red fish bay
prospects in south texas together with the cody acquisition contributed to the
significant growth in net proved reserves in the gulf coast region we plan to
drill 43 wells in 2003

     at december 31 2002 we had 154042 net acres in the region including
100861 net developed and we had identified 115 proved undeveloped drilling
locations

subsidiary cabot oil  gas marketing corporation purchases all of our natural
gas production in the gulf coast region the marketing subsidiary sells the
natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing
companies

     currently approximately 60 of our natural gas sales volumes in the gulf
coast region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one to
three years the remaining 40 of our sales volumes are sold at indexbased
prices under shortterm agreements from time to time when we believe market
conditions are favorable we may implement financial hedges on a portion of our
production in an attempt to reduce our exposure to price volatility the gulf
coast properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and
louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us
access to multiple markets

     we currently produce and market approximately 7900 barrels per day of
crude oilcondensate in the gulf coast region at market responsive prices

december 31 1994 to 2330 bcfe at december 31 2002 capital and exploration
expenditures were 259 million for 2002 or 21 of our total 2002 capital and
exploration expenditures and 429 million for 2001 in addition to drilling
activity approximately 19 million was expended in 2002 for lease acquisition
and seismic data to provide exploration and development opportunities in the
future for 2003 we have budgeted 200 million 13 of our total 2003 budget
for capital and exploration expenditures in the area the 2003 drilling program
consists of several new exploration plays complemented by development drilling

     we had 491 wells 2211 net in the rocky mountains area as of december 31

all of our natural gas production in the western region this marketing
subsidiary sells the natural gas to power generators natural gas processors
local distribution companies industrial customers and marketing companies

     currently approximately 86 of our natural gas production in the western
region is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one to three years at
indexbased prices another 12 of the natural gas production is sold under
shortterm arrangements at indexbased prices and the remaining 2 is sold under
certain fixedprice contracts from time to time when we believe market
conditions are favorable we may implement financial hedges on a portion of our
production in an attempt to reduce our exposure to price volatility the western
region properties are connected to the majority of the midwestern and
northwestern interstate and intrastate pipelines affording us access to
multiple markets

     we currently also produce and market approximately 450 barrels of crude
oilcondensate per day in the western region at market responsive prices

eastern region

     our eastern activities are concentrated in west virginia pennsylvania
ohio and virginia in this region our assets include a large undeveloped
acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and
pipeline systems and storage capacity we have achieved a drilling success rate
of 89 in the region since 1991 capital and exploration expenditures were 221
million for 2002 or 17 of our total 2002 capital spending and 441 million
for 2001 for 2003 we have budgeted 277 million 18 of our total 2003
budget for capital and exploration expenditures in the region

     at december 31 2002 we had 2401 wells 22156 net of which 2319
wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include
the devonian shale oriskany berea weir and big lime formations at depths
primarily ranging from 1500 to 9000 feet average net daily production in 2002
was 497 mmcfe while natural gas production volumes from eastern reservoirs are
relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united states
the productive life of eastern reserves is relatively long at december 31
2002 we had 4554 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all natural gas in
the eastern region constituting 39 of our total proved reserves this region
is managed from our office in charleston west virginia

     in 2002 we drilled 44 wells 39 net in the eastern region of which 43
wells 38 net were development wells in 2003 we plan to drill 82 wells

     at december 31 2002 we had 956003 net acres in the region including
741652 net developed and we had identified 316 proved undeveloped drilling
locations

     ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we
operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of
approximately 2500 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate
transmission systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users
as of the end of 2002 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west
virginia is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as
such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary
cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the
ferc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to
connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead
directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial
end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also
enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third
parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon
third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs
of pipeline and compressor additions to our system

                                       6

page

     we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a
combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to
take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the
higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while
maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the
storage fields also enable us to periodically increase the volume of natural gas
that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver
solely from our production in the eastern region the pipeline systems and
storage fields are fully integrated with our operations

     in addition we own and operate two brine treatment plants that process and
treat waste fluid generated during the drilling completion and production of
oil and gas wells the first plant near franklin pennsylvania began operating
in 1985 it provides services primarily to other oil and gas producers in
southwestern new york eastern ohio and western pennsylvania in april 1998 we
acquired a second brine treatment plant in indiana pennsylvania that had been
in existence since 1987

eastern region marketing

     the principal markets for our eastern region natural gas are in the
northeastern united states cabot oil  gas marketing purchases our natural gas
production in the eastern region as well as production from local thirdparty
producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of natural gas for
resale this marketing subsidiary sells natural gas to industrial customers
local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and
gathering system

     approximately 65 of our natural gas sales volume in the eastern region is
sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one to two years in
addition spot market sales are made under monthtomonth contracts while
industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts
approximately 5 of eastern production is sold on fixed price contracts that
typically renew annually from time to time we may also use financial hedges on
a portion of our production to reduce the potential risk of falling prices when
we believe market conditions are favorable

risk management

     from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we
use certain financial instruments called derivatives to manage price risks
associated with our production and brokering activities while there are many
different types of derivatives available in 2002 we primarily employed natural
gas and oil price swap and collar agreements to attempt to manage price risk
more effectively the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from
counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas or crude oil for
the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period
when the swap is put in place the collar arrangements are put and call options
used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of
production during a certain time period they provide for payments to
counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the
counterparties if the index price is below the floor

     we had certain costless collar arrangements on half of our natural gas
production for the months of february through october 2001 these financial
instruments resulted in a 050 per mcf increase to our realized natural gas
price in 2002 we employed both price swaps and collars for 57 of our natural
gas and 43 of our crude oil as part of our risk reduction strategy these
financial instruments resulted in a 001 per mcf decline to our realized
natural gas price and a 181 per bbl decline to our realized crude oil price
we will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future
please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations  commodity price swaps and options for further discussion
concerning our use of derivatives

1 liquids include crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids ngl
2 natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6 mcf of
      natural gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids

     the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum
engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum
engineers for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves
the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information
about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to
the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review
letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k
our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those
filed by us with other federal agencies our reserves are sensitive to natural
gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our
reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of
december 2002

     there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proved reserves including many factors beyond our control such as commodity
pricing therefore the reserve information in this form 10k represents only
estimates reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact
manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as
a result estimates of different engineers often vary in addition results of
drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates
are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are
ultimately recovered the meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on
the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based in general the
volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are
depleted except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing
proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or
both our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced

competition

     competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract
terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution
efficiencies and reliable delivery records affect competition we believe that
our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline
systems and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers
in the eastern region who do not have similar systems or facilities in place we
also believe that our competitive position in the eastern region is enhanced by
the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas companies we also
actively compete against other companies with substantially larger financial and
other resources particularly in the western and gulf coast regions

other business matters

major customer

     in 2002 approximately 14 of our total sales were made to one customer
this customer operates certain properties in which we have interests in the gulf
coast and purchases all of the production from these wells this customer is
currently reselling the natural gas and oil to third parties with whom we would
deal directly if the customer either ceased to exist or stopped buying our
portion of the production in 2001 and 2000 we had no sales to any customer that
exceeded 10 of our total gross revenues

seasonality

     demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and
typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production

     exploration and production operations are subject to various types of
regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes
requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or
operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and
casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are
drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also
subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the
regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the
density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or
pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling
or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on
voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws
establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally
prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain
requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these
regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from
our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill
because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often
are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future
cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and
gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its
profitability we do not believe however we are affected materially
differently by these regulations than others in the industry

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation

     federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the
price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is
transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 the ferc regulates
the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural
gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or
gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are exempted from ferc
jurisdiction effective january 1 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act
deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which
includes all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad
industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc has granted to all
producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity
authorizing the sale of gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a
result all of our produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices
subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect

     our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by
intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the prices we
receive for our production are affected by the cost of transporting the gas to
the consuming market through a series of comprehensive rulemakings beginning
with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and
order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted regulatory changes that have
significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these
changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things
transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers
of gas to the primary role of gas transporters order no 436 generally required
interstate pipelines to become open access transporters of natural gas
thereby requiring pipelines to transport gas supplies owned by others in
competition with their own supplies order no 636 further required that
interstate pipelines cease making bundled sales of natural gas ie gas
sales at a single price that includes both the cost of the gas and the cost of
its delivery and further required that pipelines unbundle their gathering and

                                       14

page

transmission services order no 637 has implemented additional requirements to
increase the transparency of pricing for pipeline services including requiring
pipelines to implement imbalance management services for shippers restricting
the ability of pipelines to impose penalties for imbalances overruns and
noncompliance with operational flow orders and implementing a number of new
reporting requirements the ferc has also developed rules governing the
relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates and implemented
standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data
exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation information on a
timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis

     in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have
divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate
separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other
merchants and most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture
of their gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies
interstate pipelines thus now generally provide unbundled open and
nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to
producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end
users and other customers seeking such services sellers and buyers of gas have
gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are
better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we
believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at
the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas
marketplace

     our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for
safety compliance by the us department of transportation and the west virginia
public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety
improvement act of 2002 which contains a number of provisions intended to
increase pipeline operating safety among other provisions this act will
require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management
program that must at a minimum include an inspection of pipeline facilities
within the next ten years and at least every seven years thereafter

     we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other
regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on
our activities similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any
that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by
congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such
proposals might have on us similarly and despite the recent trend toward
federal deregulation or lighterhanded regulation of the natural gas
industry whether or to what extent that trend will continue or what the
ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas cannot be predicted

federal regulation of petroleum

     our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at
market prices the price received from the sale of these products is affected by
the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is
through interstate common carrier pipelines effective january 1 1995 the ferc
implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved
interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those
rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation
subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may tend to
increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate
pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a
given year these regulations have generally been approved on judicial review
every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual
change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the
oil pipeline industry the first such review has been completed and on december
14 2000 the ferc reaffirmed the current index we are not able to predict with
certainty the effect upon us of these relatively new federal regulations or of
the periodic review by the ferc of the index

environmental regulations

     general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local
laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission
transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are
required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be
revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities
enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both
government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing
and operating oil and gas facilities although we believe that compliance with
environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks
of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues
are part of oil and gas production operations no assurance can be given that
significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible
that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations
and claims for

                                       15

page

damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production could
result in substantial costs and liabilities to us

     solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past
owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil
and gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were
standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that
hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or
under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws
applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over
time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to
remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or
released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination
including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform
plugging operations to prevent future contamination

     we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal
resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the
environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for
certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt
from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous
wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject
to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we
encounter today

     superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act cercla also known as the superfund law imposes liability
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain
persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the
environment these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any
party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances
found at a site cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private
parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to
recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in the course of
business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may fall
within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or
operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result
we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up
sites where such wastes have been disposed see item 3 legal proceedings for a
discussion of the casmalia superfund site

     oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and
resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from
such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united
states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including
wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns liability to each responsible
party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages

     clean water act the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean
water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of
permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the
united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act
are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified
deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease
construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water
discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and
related federal and state regulations

     clean air act our operations are subject to local state and federal laws
and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution payment of
fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties
for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory
agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain
facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially
comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and
regulations

employees

     as of december 31 2002 cabot oil  gas had 347 active employees we
recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we
maintain with our employees overall we believe that our relations with our
employees are satisfactory the company and its employees are not represented by
a collective bargaining agreement in january 2003 we released 10 employees and
will record associated expenses of 06 million during the first quarter of
2003

     our profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond our control
such as natural gas and crude oil prices please see items 7 and 7a we face a
variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses our
business involves a variety of operating risks including blowouts cratering
explosions and fires mechanical problems uncontrolled flows of oil natural
gas or well fluids formations with abnormal pressures pollution and other
environmental risks and natural disasters we conduct operations in shallow
offshore areas which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations
such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather

     our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves
various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused
by pipeline leaks and ruptures any of these events could result in loss of
human life significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment
of our operations and substantial losses to us the location of pipelines near
populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and
industrial sites could increase these risks in accordance with customary
industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these
risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by
insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat
dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we
choose to operate during the past few years we have drilled a higher
percentage of our wells in the gulf coast where insurance rates are
significantly higher than in other regions such as the east at december 31
2002 we owned or operated approximately 3200 miles of natural gas gathering
and transmission pipeline systems throughout the united states as part of our
normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines
that we believe may require repair replacement or additional maintenance and we
schedule this maintenance as appropriate

     the sale of our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors
beyond our control the factors include the availability and capacity of
transportation and processing facilities our failure to access these facilities
and obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our
business

item 3 legal proceedings

     we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of
our business all known liabilities are fully accrued based on managements best
estimate of the potential loss in managements opinion final judgments or
settlements if any which may be awarded in connection with any one or more of
these suits and claims would not have a significant impact on the results of
operations financial position or cash flows of any period

environmental liability

     the epa notified us in february 2000 of our potential liability for waste
material disposed of at the casmalia superfund site site located on a
252acre parcel in santa barbara county california over 10000 separate
parties disposed of waste at the site while it was operational from 1973 to
1992 the epa stated that federal state and local governmental agencies along
with the numerous private entities that used the site for disposal of
approximately 45 billion pounds of waste would be expected to pay the cleanup
costs which are estimated by the epa to be 2719 million the epa is also
pursuing the ownersoperators of the site to pay for remediation

                                       17

page

     we received documents with the notification from the epa indicating that we
used the site principally to dispose of salt water from two wells over a period
from 1976 to 1979 there is no allegation that we violated any laws in the
disposal of material at the site the epas actions stem from the fact that the
ownersoperators of the site do not have the financial means to implement a
closure plan for the site

     a group of potentially responsible parties including us formed a group
called the casmalia negotiating committee cnc the cnc has had extensive
settlement discussions with the epa and has entered into a consent decree which
will require the cnc to pay approximately 27 million toward site clean up in
return for a release from liability on january 30 2002 we placed 1283283
in an escrow account representing our volumetric share of the cncunited states
settlement this cash settlement once released from escrow and paid to the
federal government after the consent decree is entered by the court will
resolve all federal claims against us for response costs and will release us
from all response costs related to the site except for future claims against us
for natural resource damage unknown conditions transshipment risks and claims
by third parties most of the cnc including us have purchased insurance
designed to protect us from these liabilities not covered by the consent decree

     the state of california a third party has asserted a claim against the
cnc and other companies alleged to have waste at casmalia for costs the state
incurred and will incur at the site the cnc has presented the claim to its
insurer the ultimate disposition of this claim is unknown however given the
size of the states claim and the number of parties allegedly responsible the
companys share of this claim is expected to be immaterial

     we have established a reserve we believe to be adequate to provide for this
environmental liability and related legal costs

wyoming royalty litigation

     in june 2000 we were sued by two overriding royalty owners in wyoming
state court for unspecified damages the plaintiffs have requested class
certification under the wyoming rules of civil procedure and allege that we have
improperly deducted costs of production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs
and other similarly situated persons additionally the suit claims that we have
failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of
the deductions taken from royalties in january 2002 thirteen overriding
royalty owners sued us in wyoming federal district court the plaintiffs in the
federal case have made the same general claims pertaining to deductions from
their overriding royalty as the plaintiffs in the wyoming state court case but
have not asked for class certification

     although we believe that a number of the our defenses are supported by
wyoming case law a recent letter decision handed down by a state district court
in another case does not support certain of the defenses the decision has not
been reduced to a formal order and it is not known what effect if any the
decision will have on the pending cases

     in our federal case the judge recently agreed to certify two questions of
state law for decision by the wyoming state supreme court the wyoming state
supreme court has agreed to decide both questions and these decisions should
dispose of important issues in these cases the federal judge refused however
to certify one question on check stub reporting that had been decided adversely
to the companys position in the state district court letter decision after the
federal judges refusal to certify this issue the plaintiffs reduced the
damages they were claiming the plaintiffs in the federal case currently claim
55 million in damages for the deductions and related issues and 129 million
in damages for violation of the check stub reporting statute in the opinion of
our outside counsel brown drew  massey llp the likelihood of the plaintiffs
recovering the stated damages for violation of the check stub reporting statute
is remote

     we are vigorously defending both cases we have a reserve that we believe
is adequate to provide for these potential liabilities based on our estimate of
the probable outcome of these matters should circumstances change the
potential impact could materially affect quarterly or annual results of
operations and cash flows however management does not believe it would
materially impact our financial position

west virginia royalty litigation

     in december 2001 we were sued by two royalty owners in west virginia state
court for an unspecified amount of damages the plaintiffs have requested class
certification under the west virginia rules of civil procedure and allege that
we have failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas
produced that we have taken improper deductions from the royalty and have
failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of
deductions taken from the royalty the plaintiffs have also claimed that they
are entitled to a 18th royalty share of the gas sales contract settlement
that we reached with columbia in the 1995 columbia bankruptcy proceeding

     we had removed the lawsuit to federal court however in february 2003 we
received an order remanding the lawsuit back to state court discovery and
pleadings necessary to place the

                                       18

class certification issue before the court have been ongoing no trial or
dispositive motions dates have been set and limited factual discovery is
ongoing

     the investigation into this claim continues and it is in the discovery
phase we are vigorously defending the case we have a reserve that we believe
is adequate to provide for these potential liabilities based on its estimate of
the probable outcome of this matter should circumstances change the potential
impact may materially affect quarterly or annual results of operations and cash
flows however management does not believe it would materially impact our
financial position

texas title litigation

     on january 6 2003 we were served with plaintiffs second amended original
petition in romeo longoria et al v exxon mobil corporation et al in the
79th judicial district court of brooks county texas the plaintiffs allege that
they are the rightful owners of a onehalf undivided mineral interest in and to
certain lands in brooks county texas as cody energy inc we acquired certain
leases and wells from wynncrosby 1996 ltd in 1997 and 1998 and as cabot oil 
gas corporation we subsequently acquired a 320 acre lease from hector and gloria
lopez in 2001 the plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to be declared the
rightful owners of an undivided interest in the surface and minerals and all
improvements on the lands on which we acquired these leases the plaintiffs also
assert claims for trespass to try title action to remove a cloud on the title
failure to properly account for royalty fraud trespass conversion all for
unspecified actual and exemplary damages there is a trial date of may 19 2003
however the recent addition of the company as defendant as well as others is
expected to lead to a continuance of that trial date we have not had the
opportunity to conduct discovery in this matter the company estimates that
production revenue from this field since its predecessor cody energy acquired
title and since the company acquired its lease is approximately 12 million the
carrying value of this property is approximately 35 million

     although the investigation into this claim has just begun we intend to
vigorously defend the case management cannot currently determine the likelihood
or range of any potential outcome

        the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our
results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form

this material

        statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these
forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties including those
discussed below which could cause actual results to differ from those
expressed please read forwardlooking information on page 31

        we operate in one segment natural gas and oil exploration and
development

overview

        our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price
of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically
attractive terms price volatility in the natural gas market has remained
prevalent in the last few years in early 2001 the nymex futures market
reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices we benefited from this
market with our realized natural gas price reaching 566 per mcf in december
and 846 per mcf in january 2001 when the nymex futures market was near its
high on the last day of december 2000 we entered into a series of price collars
that protected us from the subsequent price decline until their expiration in
october 2001 see the commodity price swaps and options discussion about
hedging on page 36 these price collar arrangements boosted 2001 revenue by
346 million increasing the average realized natural gas price by 050 per
mcf in 2002 natural gas prices rose throughout the year beginning with a 260
per mcf price in january and ending with a december realized price of 417 per
mcf this pattern is contrary to the pattern of prices declining throughout the
year as seen in 2001

        the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over
the course of 2001 and 2002 index represents the henry hub index price per
mmbtu the 2001 and 2002 price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by
us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar or swap
arrangements

        we reported earnings of 051 per share or 161 million for 2002
this is down from the 156 per share or 471 million reported in 2001 the
weaker price environment coupled with the impact of our hedge arrangements were
the driving factors in this decline prices including the impact of the hedge
arrangements fell

31 for natural gas and 4 for oil partially offsetting this negative price
impact natural gas production was up 7 and crude oil sales volumes were up 50
from last year overall on a mcfe basis our production grew more than 12 over
2001 an 8 production increase was a result of the full year impact of the
acquisition of cody company which was effective august 1 2001 and the
remaining 4 resulted from our drilling activities

     we drilled 108 gross wells with a success rate of 93 in 2002 compared to
208 gross wells and an 87 success rate in 2001 total capital expenditures were
1263 million in 2002 compared to 4534 million for 2001 which included
1813 million in cash and 499 million in common stock paid for cody company
capital spent in drilling activity decreased 525 million from 2001 which
remains our largest capital program to date in previous years our capital
spending excluding major acquisitions used substantially all of our operating
cash flow in 2002 our capital and exploration expenditures were under this
level allowing us the reduce debt by 280 million our strategy in 2003 is
anticipated to remain consistent with 2002 we believe our operating cash flow
in 2003 will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending
of 154 million and again provide excess cash flow to reduce debt

     at the end of 2002 our debttototal capitalization ratio was 510 an
improvement from 531 at the end of 2001 this improvement was primarily the
result of the decrease in debt levels and occurred despite a 138 million
reduction in the other comprehensive income portion of equity during 2000 we
improved our debttototal capitalization ratio from 611 at the end of 1999 to
526 at the close of 2000 this improvement was a result of several significant
accomplishments we sold 34 million shares of common stock in may 2000 for net
proceeds of 715 million of which 516 million was used to repurchase all of
our preferred stock the remaining proceeds along with another 148 million
from employee stock option exercises were used to reduce debt and pay
dividends from year end 1999 to year end 2000 we reduced debt by 24 million

     we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit
balancing the higher risk higher reward exploration opportunities with an
extensive development program and from synergistic acquisitions we plan to
remain disciplined in our capital program while providing for growth potential
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment
enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term

financial condition

capital resources and liquidity

     our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas
properties and assetbased borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves our
level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors including the price of
natural gas and oil our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our
ability to control and reduce costs demand for natural gas has historically
been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher
prices in the winter heating season however in the summer of 2000 our
realized gas prices began to climb to unseasonably high levels and by january
2001 we realized the highest prices in the companys history then in 2001 our
realized natural gas price declined throughout the year to a low of 232 per
mcf in december in 2002 commodity prices rose throughout the year with
decembers realized natural gas price up 60 from the january price a mild
winter and the economic recession may have been contributing factors in the 2001
pricing volatility while a colder winter and the threat of potential military
activity in the middle east may have contributed to rising prices in 2002

     the primary sources of cash during 2002 were funds generated from
operations and to a lesser extent proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic
assets and the sale of stock funds were used primarily for exploration and
development expenditures reductions to the level of borrowing on the revolving
credit facility and dividend payments

                                       23

     we had a net cash outflow of 31 million during 2002 the net cash inflow
from operating activities of 1651 million was sufficient to fund the 1434
million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures and 217 million
of the reduction to debt cash proceeds from the sales of nonstrategic assets
and the sale of stock combined to provide an additional 81 million of cash
flow

     cash flows provided by operating activities in 2002 were 853 million
lower than in 2001 this decrease was the result of lower realized commodity
prices combined with both an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in
accounts payable cash flows provided by operating activities in 2001 were
1314 million higher than in 2000 this improvement was primarily a result of
increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and to a lesser extent
to increased natural gas and oil production

     cash flows used by investing activities in 2002 were attributable to
capital and exploration expenditures of 1433 million offset by the receipt of
47 million in proceeds received from the sale of nonstrategic oil and gas
properties

     cash flows used by investing activities in 2001 included the 1813 million
cash portion of the cody company acquisition additionally capital spending for
drilling and facilities increased 395 million or 49 from 2001 to 1195
million we drilled 208 gross wells which represents a 61 increase over 2000

     cash flows used by investing activities in 2000 were attributable to
capital and exploration expenditures of 1192 million offset by the receipt of
31 million in proceeds received from the sale of nonstrategic oil and gas
properties

     cash flows used by financing activities in 2002 included 28 million used
to reduce the yearend debt balance to 365 million from 393 million in 2001
and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders

     cash flows provided by financing activities in 2001 included the impact of
issuing 170 million in a private placement of notes in july 2001 used to
partially fund the cody company acquisition partially offsetting this debt
increase was the reduction to the balance outstanding on the revolving credit
facility and the may 2001 prepayment of 16 million in debt that was due in may
2002

     cash flows provided by financing activities in 2000 included 851 million
in proceeds received from the sale of common stock both in a block trade and
through the exercise of employee stock options of the proceeds 516 million
was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock
additional cash used in financing activities included 24 million used to reduce
the yearend debt balance to 269 million from 293 million in 1999 and cash
used to pay dividends to stockholders

     we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks the revolving
term of which runs to october 2006 the available credit line under this
facility currently 250 million is subject to adjustment on the basis of the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets
accordingly oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation since
the current price environment remains volatile management can not predict how
future price levels may change the banks longterm price outlook to reduce the
impact of any redetermination we strive to manage our debt at a level below the
available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity at year
end this excess capacity totaled 155 million or 62 of the total available
credit line management believes it has the ability to finance if necessary
our capital requirements including acquisitions oil and gas prices also affect
the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance please

detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility

       in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the
outstanding level of borrowings we have a period of three months to reduce our
outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line with a requirement to provide
additional borrowing base assets or pay down onethird of the excess during each
of the three months

       our 2003 interest expense is expected to be approximately 236 million
including interest on the 170 million 733 weighted average fixed rate notes

       during 2002 dividends were paid on our common stock totaling 51
million we have paid quarterly common stock dividends of 004 per share since
becoming publicly traded in 1990 the amount of future dividends is determined
by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors including
future earnings financial condition and capital requirements

       in may 2000 we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the
holder for 516 million since this stock had been recorded at a stated value
of 567 million on our balance sheet we realized a negative dividend to
preferred stockholders of 51 million we received net proceeds of 715
million from the sale of 34 million shares of common stock in a public offering
primarily to fund this transaction after repurchasing the preferred stock the
excess proceeds were used to reduce debt

capital and exploration expenditures

       on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration
activities excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions with cash
generated from operations we budget these capital expenditures based on our
projected cash flows for the year

       total capital and exploration expenditures for 2002 decreased 3271
million compared to 2001 the spending in 2001 included the 2312 million cody
acquisition the remaining 959 million of the decrease was due to smaller
drilling and geological and geophysical programs for 2002 in 2002 we drilled
108 gross wells compared to 208 gross wells drilled in 2001 representing a 48
decline in drilling activity also the 2001 drilling program included a 153
million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over 2000 including
costs of obtaining seismic data that supports future drilling programs

       we plan to drill 180 gross wells in 2003 compared with 108 gross wells
drilled in 2002 this 2003 drilling program includes 1539 million in total
capital and exploration expenditures up from 1263 million in 2002 expected
spending in 2003 includes 889 million for drilling and dry hole exposure
108 million for lease acquisition and 129 million in geological and
geophysical expenses in addition to the drilling and exploration program other
2003 capital expenditures are planned primarily for production equipment and for
gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction we will
continue to assess the commodity price environment and may increase or decrease
the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly so as to not jeopardize our
economic returns

contractual obligations

       we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types on
contracts note agreements and leases we have no offbalance sheet debt or
other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any

          represents the december 31 2002 balance outstanding on the revolving
          credit facility typically we are able to replace this credit
          agreement with a new one as this comes due see discussion in note 5

potential impact of our critical accounting policies

       readers of this document and users of the information contained in it
should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on
the accounting policies in place the three most significant policies are
discussed below

commodity pricing and risk management activities

       our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to
borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing
prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas
prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity
ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also
may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically
historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices
fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed
prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial
results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce
revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test
under sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived
assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural
gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results

       the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices
generally if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our
production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize
is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may
mitigate this price risk with the

                                       26

page

use of financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments
such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining
prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also risk that the
movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to
realize the full benefit of a market improvement

       we covered 16 of our production in 2000 with natural gas price collar
arrangements and prices rose above the ceiling during some months if we had not
had these collars in place in 2000 our realized natural gas price would have
been 017 per mcf higher in 2001 we covered 35 of our natural gas production
with price collar arrangements and prices were below the floor for several
months the gains from the 2001 price collars improved our annual realized
natural gas price by 050 per mcf during 2002 we hedged 57 of our natural
gas production with a combination of price swaps and collars the impact of
these hedges reduced our 2002 realized natural gas price by 001 per mcf also
in 2002 43 of our crude oil production was hedged with a series of price
collars the impact of these hedges reduced our realized crude oil price by
181 per bbl in 2002

successful efforts method of accounting

       we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and
unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including
seismic purchases and processing exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs
of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred during
2002 we drilled nine exploratory wells and three of them were unsuccessful
adding 69 million to exploration expense additionally we abandoned certain
sections of exploration well bores that were not economical in the amount of
39 million this 67 success rate for exploratory wells is higher than our
historical rate and as we focus more on our exploration program we are exposed
to the risk of dry hole expense development costs including the costs to drill
and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate
proved reserves are capitalized

       we are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our
assets exceeds their future expected cash flows this may occur if a field
discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a
level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field we
determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a
result of the annual review of all fields the impairment of unamortized capital
costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is
determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net
book value for the yearended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 we had
impairment of longlived asset expense of 27 million 69 million and 91

       the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently
uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact
manner the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic
engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this
technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions
some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices drilling and
operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the
accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of

           the quality and quantity of available data
           the interpretation of that data
           the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and
           the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate

       our proved reserve information included in this document is based on
estimates we prepared estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than
our estimates

       because these estimates depend on many assumptions all of which may
substantially differ from actual results reserve estimates may be different
from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered
in addition results of drilling testing and production after the date of an
estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate

       you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is
the current market value of our

                                       27

page

estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec
requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved
reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate actual future prices
and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the
date of the estimate

       our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization expense
dda is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves if the estimates of
proved reserves declines the rate at which we record dda expense increases
reducing net income such a decline may result from lower market prices which
may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields in
addition the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our
annual impairment test under sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets when adopted

operating risks and insurance coverage

       our business involves a variety of operating risks including

      blowouts cratering and explosions
      mechanical problems
      uncontrolled flows of oil natural gas or well fluids
      fires
      formations with abnormal pressures
      pollution and other environmental risks and
      natural disasters

       the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also
involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental
hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near
populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and
industrial sites could increase these risks any of these events could result
in loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution
impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us in accordance with
customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of
these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered
by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat
dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we
choose to operate during the past few years we have drilled a higher
percentage of our wells in the gulf coast where insurance rates are
significantly higher than in other regions such as the east

other issues and contingencies

       corporate income tax we generate tax credits for the production of
certain qualified fuels including natural gas produced from tight sands
formations and devonian shale the credit for natural gas from a tight sand
formation tight gas sands amounts to 052 per mmbtu for natural gas sold
prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992 a number of wells
drilled in the eastern region and rocky mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified
for the tight gas sands tax credit the credit for natural gas produced from
devonian shale is estimated to be 110 per mmbtu in 2002 in 1995 and 1996 we
completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits
resulting in revenues of 20 million in 2002 the tax credit wells were
repurchased in december 2002 and therefore no monetization revenue will be
realized in 2003 see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion

       we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the
alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national
energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt
requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on
account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion
deductions the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years
beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a
taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of
such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference

       regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by
federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas
production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other
business matters section of item 1 business for a discussion of these
regulations

                                       28

       restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain
types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the
companys various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving
credit agreement and the notes see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash
flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at
december 31 2002 the calculated ratio for 2002 was 79 to 10 on both the
revolving credit agreement and the notes in the unforeseen event that we fail
to comply with these covenants the company may apply for a temporary waiver
with the bank which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the
situation see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity and note 5
of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

       limited partnership as part of the cody acquisition we acquired a
interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field as general
partner of a partnership and as an operator our current interest in kurten is
approximately 25 including a one percent interest in the partnership under
the partnership agreement we have the right to a reversionary working interest
that would bring our ultimate interest to 50 upon the limited partner reaching
payout under the partnership agreement the limited partner has the sole option
to trigger a liquidation of the partnership effective february 13 2003 the
kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partners election in
connection with the liquidation an appraisal has been obtained to allocate the
interest in the partnership assets based on the receipt of the appraisal in
february 2003 we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the
liquidation due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on
future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field the limited partners
decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation we performed an
impairment review which resulted in an aftertax charge of approximately 55
million this impairment charge will be reflected in the first quarter of 2003
as an operating expense but will not impact the companys cash flows in
addition we will record a downward reserve revision of approximately 16 bcfe
as a result of the loss of the reversionary interest

conclusion

       our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of
natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive
terms the average produced natural gas sales price received by us including
the impact of derivatives has changed from yeartoyear as follows

       2002 decreased 31 from 2001 to 302 per mcf
       2001 increased 37 over 2000 to 436 per mcf
       2000 increased 44 over 1999 to 319 per mcf
       1999 increased 3 over 1998 to 222 per mcf
       1998 decreased 15 from 1997 to 216 per mcf
       1997 increased 8 over 1996 to 253 per mcf

       the volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in
2003 with wide price swings in daytoday trading on the nymex futures market
given this continued price volatility we can not predict what pricing levels
will be in the future because future cash flows are subject to these variables
there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully
fund our planned capital expenditures for these reasons we periodically use
derivative instruments to manage some of the price volatility

       while our 2003 plan now includes 1539 million in capital and
exploration spending we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust
our 2003 spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital
requirements including if necessary reductions in capital and exploration
expenditures or common stock dividends we plan on remaining disciplined in our
capital program we believe our capital resources supplemented with external
financing if necessary are adequate to meet our capital requirements

recently issued accounting pronouncements

       in june 2001 the fasb approved for issuance sfas 143 accounting for
asset retirement obligations sfas 143 establishes accounting requirements for
retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets

                                       29

page

including 1 the timing of the liability recognition 2 initial measurement
of the liability 3 allocation of asset retirement cost to expense 4
subsequent measurement of the liability and 5 financial statement disclosures
sfas 143 requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of
the cost of the related longlived asset and subsequently allocated to expense
using a systematic and rational method the adoption of sfas 143 resulted in 1
an increase of total liabilities because more retirement obligations are
required to be recognized 2 an increase in the recognized cost of assets
because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the longlived
asset and 3 an increase in operating expense because of the accretion of the
retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion the majority of
the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the plugging
and abandonment of oil and gas wells the company adopted the statement on
january 1 2003 the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas
143 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
in january 2003 the impact on the financial statements of adopting sfas 143 is
disclosed in note 12 adoption of sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations to the financial statements

     in august 2001 the fasb also approved sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 replaces sfas 121
accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to
be disposed of the new accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed
of by sale applies to all longlived assets including discontinued operations
and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 30 reporting results of
operationsreporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business for
the disposal of segments of a business sfas 144 requires that those longlived
assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to
sell whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations
therefore discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable
value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred sfas
144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all
components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest
of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
entity in a disposal transaction the provisions of sfas 144 are effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001
and were adopted by the company in 2002 the adoption of this statement did not
impact the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

     in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements
no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections
sfas 145 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002
provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on
extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have
economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions the adoption
of this statement did not impact the companys financial position results of
operations or cash flows

     in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 146 nullifies the guidance of
the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 943 liability recognition for
certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity
including certain costs incurred in a restructuring sfas 146 requires that a
liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred sfas 146 also establishes that fair
value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability the
provisions of sfas 146 are required for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after december 31 2002 the adoption of this statement did not impact
the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows

     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure sfas 148 amends fasb statement no
123 accounting for stockbased compensation to provide alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition this statement
amends the disclosure requirements of statement 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on the reported results the provisions of sfas 148 are effective for
financial statements for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 the
adoption of this statement did not impact the companys financial position

         in january 2003 the fasb issued financial interpretation no 46
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 51
fin 46 or interpretation fin 46 is an interpretation of accounting research
bulletin 51 consolidated financial statements and addresses consolidation by
business enterprises of variable interest entities vies the primary
objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of
and financial reporting for entities over which control is achieved through
means other than voting rights such entities are known as vies the
interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise
has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected
losses if they occur receive a majority of the entitys expected residual
returns if they occur or both an enterprise shall consider the rights and
obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination
this guidance applies immediately to variable interest entities created after
january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise
obtains an interest after that date it applies in the first fiscal year or
interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in
which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february
1 2003 at this time we have only one entity that could potentially be a vie
we are evaluating this potential vie in which we have a one percent general
partner interest and that holds an interest in the kurten field to determine if
it is a vie however pursuant to the partnership agreement the limited partner
has elected to liquidate the partnership it is anticipated that this
liquidation will be completed prior to the effective date of the interpretation

2002 and 2001 compared

         net income and revenues during 2002 we reported net income of 161
million or 051 per share operating income decreased 463 million or 49
and operating revenues decreased 933 million or 21 in 2002 the decrease in
operating revenues was mainly a result of the 806 million decline in natural
gas sales due to the 31 decrease in natural gas prices and the 320 million
decrease in brokered natural gas sales revenue which was also a result of lower
prices natural gas revenue and our realized price were reduced by 06 million
due to hedges in place during 2002 see further discussion in item 7a these
decreases were partially offset by an increase in crude oil revenue of 200
million due to a 50 increase in the volume of crude oil produced operating
income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes

         the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price declined
110 per mcf or 25 to 334 decreasing operating revenues by approximately
334 million in the western region the average natural gas production sales
price decreased 149 per mcf or 38 to 239 decreasing operating revenues
by approximately 377 million the average eastern natural gas production sales
price decreased 158 per mcf or 32 to 338 decreasing operating revenues
by approximately 284 million the overall weighted average natural gas
production sales price decreased 134 per mcf or 31 to 302 per mcf in
2002

         natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up 48 bcf
or 19 to 304 bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south
louisiana and production from the cody company properties acquired in august
2001 natural gas production volume in the western region was down 09 bcf or
3 to 253 bcf due primarily to a 29 decline in drilling activity offset
slightly by a 7 increase in the success rate natural gas production volume in
the eastern region was up 06 bcf or 3 to 180 bcf as a result increased
drilling activity in the region over the past year total natural gas production
was up 45 bcf or 7 in 2002

         crude oil prices fell 112 per bbl or 4 to 2379 resulting in a
decrease to operating revenues of

                                       32

page

approximately 32 million the volume of crude oil sold in the year rose by 50
to 2869 mbbls increasing operating revenues by 239 million this production
increase was a result of our 2000 and 2001 drilling success in south louisiana
60 of the increase and the acquisition of cody company 40 of the increase

         brokered natural gas revenue decreased 320 million or 35 from the
prior year the sales price of brokered natural gas declined 35 resulting in a
decrease in revenue of 313 million the volume of natural gas brokered this
year declined by 1 reducing revenues by 07 million in prior years the
revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas were reported net on the
consolidated statement of operations as brokered natural gas margin beginning
in 2000 these amounts are reported gross as part of operating revenues and
operating expenses after including the related brokered natural gas costs we
realized a brokered gas margin of 57 million in 2002 compared to a brokered
gas margin of 29 million in 2001

         other operating revenues decreased 07 million to 64 million in
2002 we provided for payout liabilities on certain properties not operated by
us and certain estimated potential legal settlements

         costs and expenses total costs and expenses from operations decreased
468 million or 13 from 2001 due primarily to the following

        brokered natural gas cost decreased 348 million or 40 primarily
         due to the 341 million impact of decreased natural gas costs per mcf
         volumes of brokered gas purchases decreased slightly contributing
         further to a reduction in the amount of 07 million

        production and pipeline expense increased 88 million or 21
         primarily as a result of a full year of costs associated with operating
         the cody company properties acquired in august 2001 additionally
         increased insurance costs and increased drilling activity in the gulf
         coast and rockies contributed to the rise in expense on a
         unitsofproduction basis our companywide production and pipeline
         expense was 055 per mcfe in 2002 versus 051 per mcfe in 2001

        exploration expense decreased 310 million or 44 primarily as a
         result of the following

            an 89 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses
             over last year due to the unusually high 2001 acquisition of
             seismic data for future evaluation

            a 210 million decrease in dry hole costs in 2002 we drilled
             nine exploratory wells compared to 27 in 2001 our success rate on
             these wells improved from 44 in 2001 to 67 in 2002 the 169
             million in dry hole cost recognized in 2002 includes expenditures
             related to three wells from the 2001 drilling program determined to
             be dry in 2002 in the amount of 69 million as well as costs of
             abandoning certain sections of exploration well bores that were not
             economical in the amount of 39 million

            a 08 million increase for salaries wages and related benefits
             largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region
             during 2001 to support that years expanded drilling program and
             assimilating cody

        depreciation depletion amortization and impairment of unproved
         properties expense increased 174 million or 20 over 2001 natural
         gas equivalent production increased 12 increasing dda expense by
         114 million the 6 increase in the per unit expense from 109 per
         mcfe to 116 per mcfe was a result of increased production in the
         higher cost gulf coast region including a full year impact of the
         newly acquired cody properties and resulted in an 56 million
         increase to dda expense for 2001

        impairment of longlived assets decreased by 41 million this year
         this year we recorded impairments on four small fields three of which
         were in the gulf coast and one in the rocky mountains for each of
         these fields the capitalized cost exceeded the future undiscounted
         cash flows a pipeline in the eastern region was written down to fair
         market value last year two fields in the gulf coast region were
         impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted
         cash flows also in 2001 one natural gas processing plant in the rocky
         mountains area was written down to fair market value in the fourth
         quarter of 2001 the starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was
         impaired

        general and administrative expenses increased 27 million due to the
         costs associated with the retirement of the chief executive officer in
         may 2002

        taxes other than income decreased 36 million as a result of lower
         natural gas and oil revenues

         interest expense increased 44 million due to the full year impact of
the incremental debt used to partially fund the cody acquisition in august 2001
interest expense on the credit facility was down slightly due both to lower

levels of borrowings and lower interest rates

         income tax expense was down 198 million due to the comparable
decrease in earnings before income tax our effective tax rate decreased
slightly in 2002 reflecting a shift of activity between states

2001 and 2000 compared

         net income and revenues we reported net income in 2001 of 471

million or 107 per share operating income increased 305 million or 47
and operating revenues increased 784 million or 21 in 2001 the improvement
in operating revenues was mainly a result of the 1073 million rise in natural
gas sales due to the increases in both natural gas prices and production and
the 220 million increase in crude oil sales revenue in 2001 our natural gas
revenue and our realized price were bolstered by the use of collar arrangements
resulting in a 050 per mcf increase to our realized natural gas price see
further discussion in item 7a these improvements were partially offset by a
decline in brokered natural gas volume that reduced operating revenues by 504
million operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes

         the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose 065
per mcf or 17 to 444 increasing operating revenues by approximately 166
million in the western region the average natural gas production sales price
increased 102 per mcf or 36 to 388 increasing operating revenues by
approximately 267 million the average appalachian natural gas production
sales price increased 172 per mcf or 53 to 496 increasing operating
revenues by approximately 299 million the overall weighted average natural
gas production sales price increased 117 per mcf or 37 to 436 per mcf in
2001

         natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up 115 bcf
or 82 to 256 bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south
louisiana and production from the cody company properties acquired in august
2001 natural gas production volume in the western region was down 28 bcf or
10 to 262 bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the
midcontinent area during the past three years natural gas production volume in
the appalachian region was down 04 bcf or 2 to 174 bcf as a result of
lower than anticipated success of the oriskany drilling program in the region in
late 2000 and into 2001 total natural gas production was up 83 bcf or 14 in
2001

         crude oil prices fell 190 per bbl or 7 to 2491 resulting in a
decrease to operating revenues of approximately 36 million the volume of
crude oil sold in the year doubled to 1908 mbbls increasing operating revenues
by 256 million this production increase was a result of our 2000 drilling
success in south louisiana 80 increase and the acquisition of cody company
20 increase

         brokered natural gas revenue decreased 504 million or 36 from the
prior year the sales price of brokered natural gas rose 37 resulting in an
increase in revenue of 245 million the volume of natural gas brokered this
year declined by 53 reducing revenues by 749 million after including the
related brokered natural gas costs we realized a net margin of 29 million in
2001 compared to a net margin of 54 million in 2000

         other operating revenues decreased 07 million to 71 million in
2001 we received a 08 million settlement as a result of a lawsuit in 2000
we realized miscellaneous net revenue of approximately 22 million primarily
from the settlement of a natural gas sales contract

         costs and expenses total costs and expenses from operations increased
479million or 16 from 2000 due primarily to the following

        brokered natural gas cost decreased 479 million or 35 primarily
         due to the 730 million impact of the lower volume of brokered sales
         in 2001 this was partially offset by a 251 million increase due to
         higher natural gas costs compared to the prior year

        production and pipeline expense increased 55 million or 15
         primarily as a result of costs associated with operating the cody
         company properties acquired in august 2001 additionally increased
         staffing and insurance costs were incurred to support the expanded 2001
         drilling program the 2000 expense includes 05 million related to the
         closure of the region office in pittsburgh on a unitsofproduction
         basis our companywide production and pipeline expense was 051 per
         mcfe in 2001 versus 053 per mcfe in 2000 as a result of the increased
         production discussed above

        exploration expense increased 513 million or 258 primarily as a
         result of the following

            a 153 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses
             over last year due to the acquisition of seismic data for future
             evaluation and increased drilling activity in all regions

            a 349 million increase in dry hole costs although the drilling
             success rate improved from 86 in 2000 to 87 in 2001 we drilled a
             total of 208 gross wells in 2001 a 61 increase over 2000 we
             recorded seven exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast
             region versus only two in 2000 we also recorded four exploratory
             dry holes in the rocky mountains area and seven in the appalachian
             region for a total of 18 up from a company total of seven in 2000

            a 08 million increase for salaries wages and incentive
             compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf
             coast region to support the expanded drilling program

        depreciation depletion amortization and impairment expense increased
         306 million or 53 over 2000 natural gas equivalent production
         increased 21 increasing dda expense by 123 million the 27
         increase in the per unit expense from 086 per mcfe to 109 per mcfe
         was a result of increased production in the higher cost gulf coast
         region including the newly acquired cody properties and resulted in
         an 183 million increase to dda expense for 2001

        impairment of longlived assets decreased 23 million from 2000 in
         2001 two fields in the gulf coast region were impaired since the cost
         capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows also in 2001
         one natural gas processing plant in the rocky mountains area was
         written down to fair market value in the fourth quarter of 2001 the
         starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was impaired during 2000
         we recorded a 91 million impairment on one field in the gulf coast
         due to casing collapse in two of the fields wells

        general and administrative expenses increased 54 million primarily
         as a result of increased staffing during the transition period
         following the cody company acquisition and other staffing increases
         that support our larger operations additional cost increases were
         realized in incentive compensation programs as well as technology
         updates and related software maintenance

        taxes other than income increased 53 million as a result of higher
         natural gas and oil revenues

         interest expense decreased 21 million due to a lower weighted average
interest rate realized in 2001 this was despite the new notes issued to
partially fund the acquisition of cody company in august 2001

         income tax expense was up 110 million due to the comparable increase
in earnings before income tax our effective tax rate decreased in 2001
reflecting a shift of activity between states

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

oil and gas prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of
time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business

         our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to
borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing
prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and natural
gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity
ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also
may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically
historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices
fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile oil and gas
prices declined substantially in 1998 and early 1999 moved higher through 2000
and into 2001 before declining back to yearend 1998 levels in october 2001
prices continued to decline for the remainder of 2001 from the end of 2001
through half of 2002 oil and gas prices were constant with an increase in prices
during the fourth quarter because our reserves are predominantly natural gas
changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our
financial results

         prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in
response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and
gas market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our
control these factors include

        the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas
        the level of consumer product demand
        weather conditions
        political conditions in oil producing regions including the middle
         east
        the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting
         countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls
        the price of foreign imports
        actions of governmental authorities
        domestic and foreign governmental regulations
        the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels
        overall economic conditions

these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices
of oil and gas

         our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility
for our production in the natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil
markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management
overseas our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion
of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in
oil and gas prices these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of
financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices please read
the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and note 11 of the notes
to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our
hedging arrangements

commodity price swaps and options

hedges on production  swaps

         from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap
agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of
our production these derivatives are not held for trading purposes under these
price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and
crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index
such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures under our revolving credit
agreement the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed 80 of the
anticipated future production during the period covered by the hedges we did
not have crude oil swap arrangements covering our production in 2000 2001 or
2002 during 2002 we fixed the price at an average of 444 per mcf on
quantities totaling 7870 bcf representing 11 of our 2002 natural gas
production during 2001 we fixed the price at an average of 375 per mcf on
quantities totaling 918 mmcf representing approximately 1 of our 2001 natural
gas production during 2000 we fixed the price at an average of 454 per mcf
on quantities totaling 315 mmcf representing less than 1 of our 2000 natural
gas production

         natural gas price swaps increased revenue by 09 million in 2002 and
reduced revenue by 08 million in 2001

         from time to time we enter into crude oil range swaps with
counterparties these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas
133 and are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date we entered into
two crude oil range swap arrangements as follows

          a fixed price swap at 2815 per barrel unless the nymex west texas
         intermediate monthly average price falls below 2100 per barrel if
         the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below
         2100 per barrel for any month the swap is cancelled for that month
         this instrument covers 730 mbbls of production over the period january
         2003 through december 2003

          a fixed price swap at 2775 per barrel unless the nymex west texas
         intermediate monthly average price falls below 2100 per barrel if
         the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below
         2100 per barrel for any month the swap is cancelled for that month
         this instrument covers 276 mbbls of production over the period july
         2003 through december 2003

         the crude oil range swaps at december 31 2002 had a pretax unrealized
loss in the amount of 07 million which is reflected in crude oil operating
revenue and covered approximately 31 of our anticipated crude oil production
during this period we had no crude oil range swap contracts outstanding during
2001

         in january 2003 we entered into a natural gas swap arrangement to
reduce the price risk on an additional portion of our 2003 production the swap
arrangement is in place for the months of february through december 2003 with a
fixed price of 539 per mcf this hedge covers 1597 mmcf of our anticipated
natural gas production for the year

hedges on production  options

         in december 2001 and march 2002 we believed that the pricing
environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price
risk on a portion of our 2002 production through the use of a series of collars
under the collar arrangements if the index rises above the ceiling price we
pay the counterparty if the applicable index falls below the floor the
counterparty pays us the 2002 natural gas price hedges include several collar
arrangements based on nine price indexes the first series of natural gas price
collars were in place for the months of january through april 2002 with a
weighted average price floor of 268 per mcf and a weighted average price
ceiling of 353 per mcf these hedges covered 16145 mmcf or 22 of our
natural gas production for the

                                       37

page

year the second series of natural gas price collars were in place for the
months of may through august 2002 with a weighted average price floor of 254
per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of 317 per mcf these hedges
covered 18284 mmcf or 25 of our natural gas production for the year

         all indexes were within the collars during the month of january all
were below the floor for february through march and most were above the ceiling
in april through august resulting in a cash expenditure of 14 million for the
year overall the natural gas collar and swap arrangements resulted in a
reduction of 001 per mcf to our average realized natural gas price for 2002

         during 2001 we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a
portion of our 2001 natural gas production the 2001 natural gas price hedges
include several costless collar arrangements based on eight price indexes at
which we sell a portion of our production these hedges were in place for the
months of february through october 2001 and covered 24404 mmcf or 35 of our
natural gas production for the year all indexes were within the collars during
february and april some fell below the floor during the period of march and
all indexes were below the floor from june through october resulting in a 346
million cash revenue for the year these gains contributed 050 per mcf to our
average realized natural gas price for 2001

         again in august 2002 we believed that the pricing environment provided
a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of
our 2003 production through the use of natural gas price collar arrangements as
of the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 we had open natural gas price
collar contracts on our production as follows

         the natural gas price collars open at december 31 2002 noted above
included several collar arrangements based on two price indexes at which we sell
a portion of our production these hedges are in place for the full year of 2003
and cover approximately 11 of our anticipated natural gas production during
this period we also have crude oil collars open at december 31 2002 these
hedges are in place for the months of january through june 2003 with a weighted
average price floor of 2475 and a weighted average price ceiling of 2886
these hedges cover approximately 11 of our anticipated crude oil production
during this period crude oil collars reduced revenue by 52 million during
2002 but had no impact on 2001 results

         subsequent to year end we entered into a series of natural gas costless
collar and natural gas and crude oil price swap arrangements to significantly
reduce the price risk on a portion of our 2003 and 2004 production these
arrangements are as follows

          a natural gas costless collar in place for the months of february
         through december 2003 with a weighted average price floor of 471 per
         mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of 598 per mcf this hedge
         covers 6386 mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the
         year

         covers 1371 mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the
         year

          a natural gas price swap in place for the months of march through
         december 2003 with a fixed price of 446 per mcf this hedge covers
         1371 mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year

          a fixed price swap at 3000 per barrel unless the nymex west texas
         intermediate monthly average price falls below 2200 per barrel if

adoption of sfas 133

         we adopted sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities on january 1 2001 under sfas 133 the fair value of each
derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance
sheet at the end of each period these instruments are markedtomarket the
gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive
income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is
an effective hedge under sfas 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how
closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale
for example a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed
price would be perfectly correlated and 100 effective if the underlying gas
were sold at the henry hub index any portion of the gains or losses that are
considered ineffective under the sfas 133 test are recorded immediately as a
component of operating revenue on the statement of operations

         when we adopted sfas 133 we had two types of hedges in place the
first type was a cash flow hedge that set the price of a certain monthly
quantity of natural gas sold in the gulf coast region through september 2003
based on the index price strip the impact of this hedge on january 1 2001 was
to record a hedge loss of 01 million and a charge to other comprehensive
income of 42 million correspondingly a hedge liability for 43 million was
established this instrument was cancelled in december 2001 with the bankruptcy
of the counterparty no balance related to this hedge remains in other
comprehensive income

         the second type of hedge outstanding at january 1 2001 was a natural
gas price costless collar agreement we had entered into eight of these collars
for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of february
through october 2001 the collars had two components of value intrinsic value
and time value under sfas 133 both components were valued at the end of each
reporting period intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above
the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar if the
index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar the intrinsic
value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices
multiplied by the notional volume in accordance with the initial sfas 133
guidance intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a
hedge loss if the index is above the ceiling or gain if the index is below
the floor starting in 2001 under amended guidance on sfas 133 any changes in
the intrinsic value component related to future months were recorded in other
comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet
rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge was proven to
be effective these natural gas price collars were considered to be highly
effective with respect to the intrinsic value calculation since they were tied
to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold also under sfas 133 the
time value component a market premiumdiscount was markedtomarket through
the income statement each period since these collar arrangements were executed
on the last business day of 2000 the net premium value at adoption on january
1 2001 was zero

         as of december 31 2001 we had a series of nine natural gas price
collar arrangements outstanding as of december 31 2002 we had a series of 16
natural gas price swap arrangements two natural gas price collar arrangements
two crude oil price collar arrangements and two crude oil swap arrangements
outstanding in accordance with the latest guidance from the fasbs derivative
implementation group we test the effectiveness of the combined intrinsic and
time values and the effective portion of each will be recorded as a component of
other comprehensive income any ineffective portion will be recorded as a gain
or loss in the current period as of december 31 2002 we had recorded 188
million of other comprehensive income 116 million net of deferred taxes a
06 million unrealized hedge loss in revenue a 06 million hedge asset and a
200 million hedge liability exclusive of the crude oil range swaps as of
december 31 2001 we had recorded 14 million of other comprehensive income
08 million net of deferred taxes a 01 million unrealized hedge gain in
revenue and a 15 million hedge asset

item 1  business

overview

     cabot oil  gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the
exploration development acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties
located in four principal areas of the united states

     the onshore texas and louisiana gulf coast
     the rocky mountains
     the midcontinent or anadarko basin
     appalachia

administratively we operate in three regions  the gulf coast region the
western region which is comprised of the rocky mountains and midcontinent
areas and the appalachian region

     in 2001 we enjoyed a strong energy commodity price environment for most of
the year bolstered by gains realized on price hedges which were placed on about
44 of our production for the first nine months of 2001 natural gas production
near the peak of the market in december 2000  drilling successes most notably
in south louisiana over the past two years served to increase our 2001
production by 12 over 2000  while continuing to develop our existing fields
and exploring for new discoveries we took advantage of our strong cash flow and
invested for the future  most significantly we acquired cody company in august
2001  with this transaction we expanded and improved our development inventory
and added 11 exploration prospects  in addition we expanded our acreage
position with a 12 million acquisition in the rocky mountains and added
significantly to our seismic database in both the rocky mountains and gulf
coast  the five months of production from the acquired cody company properties
increased our annual production by an additional 9 over 2000 for a combined
21 production increase yearoveryear

     the purchase of cody company was the largest acquisition in our companys
history  we paid 2312 million in cash and common stock for all of the
outstanding common stock of cody company  substantially all of the proved
reserves of cody company are located in the onshore gulf coast region a
strategic growth area for us  as of december 31 2001 these properties
contributed 391 mmcfe of production per day and contained 92 proved undeveloped
drilling locations

     in 2001 87 of the wells that we drilled were successful  drilling was
successful on 40 of our 2001 exploration wells as we tested new ideas and
worked on building a foundation for the future  our 2001 capital and
exploration spending included 391 million for seismic data and lease
acquisition  this spending will support our exploration and development
drilling programs in 2002 and beyond  as we enter 2002 energy commodity prices
have softened  we will concentrate our 2002 capital spending program on
projects offering the prospect of acceptable risk and the strongest economics
as in the past we will use the cash flow from our longlived appalachian and
midcontinent natural gas reserves to fund our exploration and development
efforts in the gulf coast and rocky mountain areas  we believe these two core
producing areas offer more value accretive reserve and production growth and
higher rates of return on equity

     our proved reserves totaled approximately 12 tcfe at december 31 2001
of which 90 was natural gas this reserve level represents a 13 increase over
the prior year end the increase is due primarily to the cody acquisition which
combined with drilling activities replaced production by 268 the gulf coast
region now represents 26 of our total proved reserves up from 14 at the end
of 2000

     net income of 471 million or 156 per share was the highest annual
level of earnings that we have ever achieved  cash flow from operations in 2001
of 2504 million was also a record and represented a 110 increase over last
year  the strong commodity price environment combined with strategic price
collars were the main factors in this years financial success  production
improvements as discussed above also helped boost our earnings  daily
production averaged 199 mmcfe per day during the first seven months of the year
before increasing to approximately

                                       3
page

255 mmcfe per day in august with the acquisition of cody company overall
including the cody acquisition and additional successes in south louisiana
production averaged 222 mmcfe per day in 2001 development drilling on the
etouffee field in south louisiana has expanded producing wells to six two of
which were drilled in 2001 this field which is now fully developed remains
our largest producer and at december 31 2001 was producing 137 mmcfe per day
33 mmcfe per day net to us

gulf coast region

     our exploration development and production activities in gulf coast region
are concentrated in south louisiana and south texas  a regional office in
houston manages operations  principal producing intervals are in the wilcox and
vicksburg formations in texas and the miocene age formations in louisiana at
depths ranging from 3000 to 20500 feet  capital and exploration expenditures
made with cash and common stock were 3521 million in 2001 or 78 of our total
2001 capital and exploration expenditures and 660 million for 2000  the cash
and common stock portion of the august 2001 acquisition of cody company
accounted for 2312 million of this amount which did not include a noncash
deferred tax grossup of 780 million  our drilling and acquisition program
has increased average daily production in the region from 156 mmcfe per day in
1994 when we acquired our first gulf coast properties from washington energy
to 1316 mmcfe per day in december 2001  of this production rate 391 mmcfe
per day was associated with the newly acquired cody properties and the remaining
primarily represents production growth from our drilling activity  for 2002 we
have budgeted 569 million 54 of our total 2002 capital budget for capital
expenditures in the region  our 2002 gulf coast drilling program will emphasize
our exploration opportunities and development drilling on the prospects acquired
in the cody acquisition

     we had 1013 wells 6132 net in the gulf coast region as of december 31
2001 of which 730 wells are operated by us  average net daily production in
2001 was 978 mmcfe up from 495 mmcfe in 2000 due both to drilling success in
south louisiana and to the cody acquisition  at december 31 2001 we had 3003
bcfe of proved reserves 67 natural gas in the gulf coast region which
represented 26 of our total proved reserves

     in 2001 we drilled 35 wells 147 net in the gulf coast region of which
20 wells 776 net were development wells  the south louisiana etouffee
prospect and our new discoveries in the augen field in south

                                       4

louisiana and red fish bay prospects in south texas together with the cody
acquisition contributed to the significant growth in net proved reserves in
the gulf coast region we plan to drill 19 wells in 2002 of which seven are on
prospects acquired from cody

     at december 31 2001 we had 147844 net acres in the region including
103836 net developed and we had identified 97 proved undeveloped drilling
locations of which 92 were part of the cody acquisition

     our principal markets for gulf coast region natural gas are in the
industrialized gulf coast area and the northeastern united states our marketing
subsidiary cabot oil  gas marketing corporation purchases all of our natural
gas production in the gulf coast region the marketing subsidiary sells the
natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing
companies

     currently approximately 75 of our natural gas sales volumes in the gulf
coast region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one to
three years the remaining 25 of our sales volumes are sold at indexbased
prices under shortterm agreements from time to time when we believe market
conditions are favorable we may implement financial hedges on a portion of our
production in an attempt to reduce our exposure to price volatility the gulf
coast properties are connected to various processing plants in texas and
louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us
access to multiple markets

     we also produce and market approximately 6500 barrels per day of crude
oilcondensate in the gulf coast region at market responsive prices

western region

and washakie basin of wyoming since our initial acquisition in the area in 1994
from washington energy we have increased reserves from 1716 bcfe at december
31 1994 to 2274 bcfe at december 31 2001 capital and exploration
expenditures were 429 million for 2001 or 9 of our total 2001 capital and
exploration expenditures and 239 million for 2000 in addition to drilling
activity approximately 154 million was expended in 2001 for lease acquisition
and seismic data to provide exploration and development opportunities in the
future for 2002 we have budgeted 194 million 19 of our total 2002 capital
budget for capital expenditures in the area the 2002 drilling program consists
of several new exploration plays complemented by development drilling

     we had 528 wells 2330 net in the rocky mountains area as of december 31
2001 of which 259 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in
the rocky mountains area are in the almond frontier and dakota formations at
depths ranging from 9000 to 13500 feet average net daily production in the
rocky mountains during 2001 was 459 mmcfe

     in 2001 we drilled 31 wells 154 net in the rocky mountains of which 26
wells 115 net were development and extension wells in 2002 we plan to drill
41 wells

have budgeted 82 million 8 of our total 2002 capital budget for capital
expenditures in the area

     as of december 31 2001 we had 695 wells 4577 net in the midcontinent
area of which 515 wells are operated by us principal producing intervals in
the midcontinent are in the chase morrow red fork and chester formations at
depths ranging from 1500 to 14000 feet average net daily production in 2001
was 302 mmcfe at december 31 2001 we had 1991 bcfe of proved reserves 97
natural gas in the midcontinent area 17 of our total proved reserves

     in 2001 we drilled 25 wells 172 net in the midcontinent all of which
were development and extension wells in 2002 we plan to drill 17 wells

     at december 31 2001 we had 185849 net acres in the area including
180981 net developed acres and we had identified 62 proved undeveloped
drilling locations

western region marketing

     our principal markets for western region natural gas are in the
northwestern midwestern and northeastern united states cabot oil  gas
marketing purchases all of our natural gas production in the western region
this marketing subsidiary sells the natural gas to power generators natural gas
processors local distribution companies industrial customers and marketing
companies

     currently approximately 86 of our natural gas production in the western
region is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one to three years at
indexbased prices another 12 of the natural gas production is sold under
shortterm arrangements at indexbased prices and the remaining 2 is sold under
certain fixedprice contracts from time to time when we believe market
conditions are favorable we may implement financial hedges on a portion of our
production in an attempt to reduce our exposure to price volatility the
western region properties are connected to the majority of the midwestern and
northwestern interstate and intrastate pipelines affording us access to
multiple markets

     in december 1999 we negotiated the buyout of a longterm fixed price
sales contract that covered approximately 20 of the western region natural gas
production and was due to expire in june 2008 we received a payment of 12
million as part of this contract buyout agreement this contract was then
replaced with a fixed price sales contract that expired in april 2001 the fixed
natural gas sales price in both the original natural gas sales contract and the
replacement sales contract was below the market price at year end 2000 after
april 2001 this production was sold at market responsive prices

     we currently also produce and market approximately 600 barrels of crude
oilcondensate per day in the western region at market responsive prices

appalachian region

     our appalachian activities are concentrated in west virginia pennsylvania
ohio and virginia in this region our assets include a large undeveloped
acreage position a high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and
pipeline systems and storage capacity we have achieved a drilling success rate
of 89 in the region since 1991 capital and exploration expenditures were 441
million for 2001 or 10 of our total 2001 capital spending and 215 million
for 2000 for 2002 we have budgeted 185 million 18 of our total 2002
capital budget for capital expenditures in the region

     at december 31 2001 we had 2362 wells 21909 net of which 2281
wells are operated by us there are multiple producing intervals that include
the devonian shale oriskany berea and big lime formations at depths

                                       6
page

primarily ranging from 1500 to 9000 feet average net daily production in 2001
was 484 mmcfe while natural gas production volumes from appalachian reservoirs
are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the united
states the productive life of appalachian reserves is relatively long at
december 31 2001 we had 4273 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all
natural gas in the appalachian region constituting 37 of our total proved
reserves this region is managed from our office in charleston west virginia

     in 2001 we drilled 117 wells 1063 net in the appalachian region of
which 107 wells 970 net were development wells in 2002 we plan to drill 44
wells

     at december 31 2001 we had 964520 net acres in the region including
743204 net developed and we had identified 292 proved undeveloped drilling
locations

     ancillary to our exploration and production operations we operate a number
of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately
2500 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission
systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end
of 2001 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is
regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as such the
transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry
pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc our
natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new
wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to
interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users
control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to
purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition
we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to
transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and
compressor additions to our system

     we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a
combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to
take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and the
higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while
maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the
storage fields also enable us to periodically increase the volume of natural gas
that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver
solely from our production in the appalachian region the pipeline systems and
storage fields are fully integrated with our operations

     in addition we own and operate two brine treatment plants that process and
treat waste fluid generated during the drilling completion and production of
oil and gas wells the first plant near franklin pennsylvania began operating
in 1985 it provides services primarily to other oil and gas producers in
southwestern new york eastern ohio and western pennsylvania in april 1998 we
acquired a second brine treatment plant in indiana pennsylvania that had been
in existence since 1987

appalachian region marketing

     the principal markets for our appalachian region natural gas are in the
northeastern united states cabot oil  gas marketing purchases our natural gas
production in the appalachian region as well as production from local third
party producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of natural gas
for resale this marketing subsidiary sells natural gas to industrial customers
local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and
gathering system

     approximately 65 of our natural gas sales volume in the appalachian region
is sold at indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one to two years
in addition spot market sales are made under monthtomonth contracts while
industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear contracts
approximately 5 of appalachian production is sold on fixed price contracts that
typically renew annually from time to time we may also use financial hedges on
a portion of our production to reduce the potential risk of falling prices when
we believe market conditions are favorable

     our appalachian natural gas production has historically sold at a higher
realized price or premium compared to production from other producing regions
due to its proximity to northeastern markets while yeartoyear fluctuations in
that premium are normal due to changes in market conditions throughout the
1990s this

                                       7
page

premium has typically been in the range of 040 to 050 per mmbtu above the
henry hub index spot price as published by inside fercs gas market report for
gas delivered to this point this index is the basis for sales price in our
standard natural gas sales contract in 1999 however the average premium
declined to 027 per mmbtu due to increases in supply in the eastern market
this decline continued into early 2000 however late in 2000 and into 2001 the
premium began to increase again due to strengthening of demand and perceived
market shortages the average 2001 premium was approximately 034 per mmbtu
due to this continued volatility we are not able to predict the level of this
premium for the future

risk management

     from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we
use certain financial instruments called derivatives to manage price risks
associated with our production and brokering activities while there are many
different types of derivatives available in 2001 we primarily employed natural
gas and oil price swap and costless collar agreements to attempt to manage price
risk more effectively the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from
counterparties based on whether the market price of natural gas for the period
is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the
swap is put in place the costless collar arrangements are put and call options
used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of
production during a certain time period they provide for payments to
counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the
counterparties if the index price is below the floor

     in december 2000 we entered into certain costless collar arrangements on
half of our natural gas production for the months of february through october
2001 we realized revenue of 346 million under these arrangements in december
2001 we again entered into price collar arrangements for 60 of our anticipated
natural gas production for the months of january through april 2002 we will
continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future please

operations  commodity price swaps and options for further discussion concerning
our use of derivatives

2 natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6 mcf of natural
     gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids

     the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum
engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum
engineers for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves
the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information
about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to
the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review
letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k
our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those
filed by us with other federal agencies our reserves are sensitive to natural
gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our
reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of
december 2001

     there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proved reserves including many

                                       8
page

factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing therefore the reserve
information in this form 10k represents only estimates reserve engineering is
a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and
natural gas that can not be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any
reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of
engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result estimates
of different engineers often vary in addition results of drilling testing and
production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the
original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates are often different
from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered
the meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the
assumptions upon which they were based in general the volume of production
from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted except to the
extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct
successful exploration and development activities or both our proved reserves
will decline as reserves are produced

competition

     competition in our primary producing areas is intense  price contract
terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution
efficiencies and reliable delivery records affect competition  we believe that
our extensive acreage position existing natural gas gathering and pipeline
systems and storage fields enhance our competitive position over other producers
in the appalachian region who do not have similar systems or facilities in
place  we also believe that our competitive position in the appalachian region
is enhanced by the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas
companies  we also actively compete against other companies with substantially
larger financial and other resources particularly in the western and gulf coast
regions

other business matters

major customer

     we had no sales to any customer that exceeded 10 of our total gross
revenues in 2001 2000 or 1999

seasonality

     demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and
typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production

     exploration and production operations are subject to various types of
regulation at the federal state and local levels  such regulation includes
requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or
operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and
casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are
drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells  our operations are also
subject to various conservation laws and regulations  these include the
regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the
density of wells which may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or
pooling of oil and natural gas properties  some states allow the forced pooling
or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on
voluntary pooling of lands and leases  in addition state conservation laws
establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally
prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain
requirements regarding the ratability of production  the effect of these
regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from
our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill
because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often
are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future
cost or impact of regulatory compliance  the regulatory burden on the oil and
gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its
profitability  we do not believe however we are affected materially
differently by these regulations than others in the industry

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation

     federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the
price of the natural gas produced and the manner in which such production is
transported and marketed  under the natural gas act of 1938 the ferc regulates
the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas for resale  the fercs
jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales was substantially modified by the
natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa under which the ferc continued to
regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in first
sales in interstate and intrastate commerce  effective january 1 1993
however the natural gas wellhead decontrol act decontrol act deregulated
natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas including all sales of
our own production  as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be
sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be
in effect  the fercs jurisdiction over natural gas transportation and the sale
for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce was not affected by the
decontrol act

     natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas
transportation regulation  beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing
through order no 636 in 1992 the ferc adopted regulatory changes that have
significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas  these
changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things
transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers
of gas to the primary role of gas transporters  order no 636 required that
interstate pipelines generally cease making sales of natural gas  at the same
time ferc retained its statutory jurisdiction over the sale for resale of
natural gas in interstate commerce but issued to all entities except
interstate pipelines a blanket certificate to make sales for resale of natural
gas in interstate commerce at market based prices as a result pipelines
divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate
separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other
merchants  interstate pipelines are now required to provide open and
nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to all
producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end
users and other customers seeking service the ferc expanded the impact of open
access

regulations to intrastate commerce through its implementation of the ngpa
provisions allowing intrastate pipelines to provide service in intrastate
commerce on behalf of interstate pipelines

     more recently the ferc has pursued other policy initiatives that have
affected natural gas marketing  most notable are 1 the largescale
divestiture of interstate pipelineowned gas gathering facilities to affiliated
or nonaffiliated companies which is a result of the fercs requirement in
order no 636 that interstate pipelines unbundle gathering services from
transportation services 2 further development of rules governing the
relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates 3 the
publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and
electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation
information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely
electronic basis and 4 development of policy and promulgation of orders
pertaining to its authorization of marketbased rates rather than traditional
costofservice based rates for transportation or transportationrelated
services upon a showing of lack of market control in the relevant service
market

     the ferc continued its efforts to develop a competitive natural gas market
with order no 637 issued in 2000  order no 637 modifies ferc regulations to
1 lift the costbased cap on pipeline transportation rates in the capacity
release market until september 30 2002 for releases of pipeline capacity for
periods less than one year 2 permit pipelines to file for authority to charge
different maximum costbased rates for peak and offpeak periods 3 encourage
auctions for pipeline capacity 4 require that pipelines implement imbalance
management services for shippers 5 restrict the ability of pipelines to
impose penalties for imbalances overruns and noncompliance with operational
flow orders and 6 implement a number of new pipeline reporting requirements
to enhance market transparency  these order no 637 requirements are being
implemented by pipelines through individual tariff reform filings  order no
637 also requires the ferc staff to analyze whether the ferc should develop
additional fundamental policy changes including whether to pursue performance
based or other noncost based ratemaking methods and whether the ferc should
mandate greater standardization in terms and conditions of service across the
interstate pipeline grid

     as a result of these changes sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct
access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to
conduct business with a larger number of counterparties  we believe these
changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time
substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace

     we can not predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other
regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on
our activities  similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any
that affect the oil and natural gasindustry might actually be enacted by
congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such
proposals might have on us  similarly and despite the trend toward federal
deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend
will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas can not
be predicted

     our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for
safety compliance by the us department of transportation and the west virginia
public service commission

federal regulation of petroleum

     our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at
market prices  the price received from the sale of these products is affected
by the cost of transporting the products to market  much of that transportation
is through interstate common carrier pipelines  effective january 1 1995 the
ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved
interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those
rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation
subject to certain conditions and limitations  these regulations may tend to
increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate
pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a
given year  these regulations have generally been approved on judicial review
every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual
change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the
oil pipeline industry  the first such review has been completed and on december
14 2000 the ferc reaffirmed the current index  we are not able to predict
with certainty the effect upon us of these relatively new federal regulations or
of the periodic

environmental regulations

     general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local
laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission
transportation and discharge of materials into the environment  permits are
required for the operation of our various facilities  these permits can be
revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities  governmental authorities
enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both
government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing
and operating oil and gas facilities  although we believe that compliance with
environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks
of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues
are part of oil and gas production operations  no assurance can be given that
significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred  also it is possible
that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations
and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas
production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us

     solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past
owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil
and gas for many years  although operating and disposal practices that were
standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that
hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or
under the properties currently owned or leased by us  state and federal laws
applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over
time  under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to
remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or
released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination
including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform
plugging operations to prevent future contamination

     we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal
resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes
the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for
certain hazardous wastes  it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt
from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous
wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes  we could therefore be subject
to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we
encounter today

     superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act cercla also known as the superfund law imposes liability
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain
persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the
environment  these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any
party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances
found at a site  cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private
parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to
recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties  in the course
of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may
fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances  we may also be an
owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released  as
a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to
clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed  see item 3 legal
proceedings for a discussion of the casmalia superfund site

     oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and
resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from
such spills in waters of the united states  the term waters of the united
states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including
wetlands and intermittent streams  the opa assigns liability to each
responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private
damages

     clean water act  the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean
water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of
permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the
united states  sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water
act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified
deficiencies  however regulatory agencies could require us to cease
construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water
discharges  we believe that we comply with the clean water act and related
federal and state regulations in all material respects

                                       17
page

     clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws
and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution  payment of
fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties
for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits  regulatory
agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain
facilities that are air emission sources  we believe that we substantially
comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and
regulations

employees

     as of december 31 2001 cabot oil  gas had 366 active employees  we
recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we
maintain with our employees  overall we believe that our relations with our
employees are satisfactory  the company and its employees are not represented
by a collective bargaining agreement

other

     our profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond our control
such as natural gas and crude oil prices  please see items 7 and 7a  we face a
variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses  our
business involves a variety of operating risks including blowouts cratering
explosions and fires mechanical problems uncontrolled flows of oil natural
gas or well fluids formations with abnormal pressures pollution and other
environmental risks and natural disasters  we conduct operations in shallow
offshore areas which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations
such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather

     our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves
various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused
by pipeline leaks and ruptures  any of these events could result in loss of
human life significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment
of our operations and substantial losses to us  the location of pipelines near
populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and
industrial sites could increase these risks  in accordance with customary
industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these
risks and losses  the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by
insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat
dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we
choose to operate  during the past few years we have drilled a higher
percentage of our wells in the gulf coast where insurance rates are
significantly higher than in other regions such as appalachia  at december 31
2001 we owned or operated approximately 2900 miles of natural gas gathering
and transmission pipeline systems throughout the united states  as part of our
normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines
that we believe may require repair replacement or additional maintenance and we
schedule this maintenance as appropriate

     the sale of our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors
beyond our control the factors include the availability and capacity of
transportation and processing facilities our failure to access these facilities
and obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our
business

item 3  legal proceedings

     we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of
our business  all known liabilities are fully accrued based on managements

or settlements if any which may be awarded in connection with any one or more
of these suits and claims would not have a significant impact on the results of
operations financial position or cash flows of any period

environmental liability

     the epa notified us in february 2000 of our potential liability for waste
material disposed of at the casmalia superfund site site located on a 252
acre parcel in santa barbara county california  over 10000 separate parties
disposed of waste at the site while it was operational from 1973 to 1992  the
epa stated that federal state and local governmental agencies along with the
numerous private entities that used the site for disposal of approximately 45
billion pounds of waste would be expected to pay the cleanup costs which are
estimated by the epa to be 2719 million  the epa is also pursuing the
ownersoperators of the site to pay for remediation

     documents received by us with the notification from the epa indicate that
we used the site principally to dispose of salt water from two wells over a
period from 1976 to 1979  there is no allegation that we violated any laws in
the disposal of material at the site  the epas actions stem from the fact that
the ownersoperators of the site do not have the financial means to implement a
closure plan for the site

     a group of potentially responsible parties including us formed a group
called the casmalia negotiating committee cnc the cnc has had extensive
settlement discussions with the epa and has reached a settlement in principal to
pay approximately 27 million toward site clean up in return for a release from
liability the cnc is currently negotiating a consent decree to memorialize the
settlement on january 30 2002 we placed 1283283 in an escrow account this
amount approximates our volumetric share of epas cost estimate plus a 5
premium and is our settlement amount the escrow account is being funded by us
and many other cnc members to maximize the likelihood that there will be
sufficient funds to fund the settlement agreement upon its completion which is
expected later in 2002 this cash settlement once released from escrow and paid
to the federal government will resolve all federal claims against us for
response costs and will release us from all response costs related to the site
except for future claims against us for natural resource damage unknown
conditions transshipment risks and claims by third parties all of which are
expected to be covered by insurance to be purchased by participating cnc
members responsibility for certain state of california oversight and response
costs while not covered by the settlement or insurance are not expected to be
material no determination has been made as to whether any insurance arrangement
will allow us to recover our contribution to the settlement

     we have established a reserve that management believes to be adequate to
provide for this environmental liability based on its estimate of the probable
outcome of this matter and estimated legal costs

wyoming royalty litigation

     in june 2000 two overriding royalty owners sued us in wyoming state court
for unspecified damages  the plaintiffs have requested class certification
under the wyoming rules of civil procedure and allege that we have deducted
improper costs of production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs and other
similarly situated persons  additionally the suit claims that we have failed
to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of the
deductions taken from royalties  in december 2001 fourteen overriding royalty
owners sued us in wyoming federal court  the plaintiffs in the federal case
have made the same general claims pertaining to deductions from their overriding
royalty as the plaintiffs in the wyoming state court case but have not asked for
class certification

     management believes that we have substantial defenses to these claims and
intends to vigorously assert such defenses  we have a reserve that we believe
is adequate to provide for these potential liabilities based on our estimate of
the probable outcome of this matter  while the potential impact to us may
materially affect quarterly or annual financial results including cash flows
management does not believe it would materially impact our financial position or
results of operations

west virginia royalty litigation

     in late december 2001 two royalty owners sued us in west virginia state
court for an unspecified amount of damages  the plaintiffs have requested class
certification under the west virginia rules of civil procedure and allege that
we have failed to pay royalty based upon the wholesale market value of the gas
produced that we have taken improper deductions from the royalty and that we
have failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and other similarly situated
persons of deductions taken from the royalty

     although the investigation into this claim has just begun we intend to
vigorously defend the case  we cannot currently determine the likelihood or
range of any potential outcome

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

     the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our
results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated
financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form
10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing
this material

     statements in this discussion may be forwardlooking these forwardlooking
statements involve risks and uncertainties including those discussed below
which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed please read
forwardlooking information on page 32

     we operate in one segment natural gas and oil exploration and development

overview

     our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of
natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive
terms price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the
last few years in the first quarter of 1999 we experienced a decline in energy
commodity prices resulting in lower revenues and net income during this period
however in the summer of 1999 and continuing through 2000 prices improved for
the months of april through october 2000 we had certain natural gas hedges in
place that prevented us from realizing the full impact of this price
environment see the commodity price swaps and options discussion about hedging
on page 38 despite this limitation our realized natural gas price for each
month in the year 2000 was higher than the same month of any previous year in
the final months of 2000 and into early 2001 the nymex futures market reported
unprecedented natural gas contract prices we benefited from this market with
our realized natural gas price reaching 566 per mcf in december and 846 per
mcf in january 2001 when the nymex futures market was near its high on the last
day of december 2000 we entered into a series of price collars that protected
us from the subsequent price decline until their expiration in october 2001
these price collar arrangements boosted 2001 revenue by 346 million
increasing the average realized natural gas price by 050 per mcf the table
below illustrates how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of
2001 index represents the henry hub index price the 2001 price is the
natural gas price realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas
price collar arrangements

     we reported earnings of 156 per share or 471 million for 2001 this
is up from the 107 per share or 292 million reported in 2000 the
improvement is a result of the stronger commodity price environment during the
year 2001 and the impact of the natural gas price collar arrangements which
combined to push our realized natural gas price up 37 to 436 per mcf
additionally natural gas production was up 14 and crude oil sales volumes were
up 100 from last year overall on a mcf equivalent basis our production grew
more than 21 over 2000 a 12 production increase was a result of our drilling
successes in 2000 and 2001 and the remaining 9 increase resulted from the
acquisition of cody company which was effective august 1 2001

     a discussion of our results from recurring operations can be found in the
results of operations section beginning on page 33 before taking into account
selected items net income for 2001 was 519 million or 171 per share and
302 million or 110 per share for 2000

     in august 2001 we acquired the stock of cody company the parent of cody
energy llc cody acquisition for 2312 million consisting of 1813 million
of cash and 1999993 shares of common stock valued at 499 million
substantially all of the proved reserves of cody company are located in the
onshore gulf coast region the acquisition was recorded using the purchase
method of accounting as such the company reflected the assets and liabilities
acquired at fair value in the companys balance sheet effective august 1 2001
and the results of operations of cody company beginning august 1 2001 in 2001
these acquired properties contributed 62 bcfe of production 170 million of
operating revenue and 192 million of operating expenses including 116
million of dda expense additional 2001 costs included 53 million of interest
expense these properties contributed 103 million in operating cash flow to
2001 the purchase price totaling approximately 3156 million was allocated to
specific assets and liabilities based on certain estimates of fair values
resulting in approximately 3024 million allocated to property and 132
million allocated to working capital items this 3156 million was comprised of
noncash common stock consideration of 499 million and a noncash deferred tax
grossup of 780 million and acquisition related fees and costs of 64
million the deferred tax grossup pertains to the deferred income taxes
attributable to the differences between the tax basis and the estimated fair
value of the acquired oil and gas properties

     we drilled 208 gross wells with a success rate of 87 in 2001 compared to
129 gross wells and an 86 success rate in 2000 total capital expenditures were
4534 million for 2001 including 1813 million in cash and 499 million in
common stock paid for cody company compared to 1226 million in 2000 capital
spent in drilling activity increased 395 million with the largest activity
increase coming in the gulf coast region where we continued to develop the
etouffee augen and lake pelto prospects in south louisiana and initiated new
exploration in south texas we increased our spending for seismic data both 2d
and 3d and lease acquisition costs both in the gulf coast and rocky mountains
in order to evaluate and expand our drilling opportunities for 2001 and beyond
the largest portion of this spending occurred in december 2001

     total equivalent production for 2001 was 811 bcfe an increase of 21 over
2000 of this increase 12 resulted from drilling activity and the remaining 9
was a result of the production from the acquired cody company properties

     at the end of 2001 our debttototal capitalization ratio was 531 up
slightly from the end of 2000 this result was achieved despite expending 1813
million as cash consideration in the cody acquisition which was sourced
primarily by the issuance of 170 million in private placement notes during
2000 we improved our debttototal capitalization ratio from 611 at the end
of 1999 to 526 at the close of 2000 this improvement was a result of several
significant accomplishments we sold 34 million shares of common stock in may
2000 for net proceeds of 715 million of which 516 million was used to
repurchase all of our preferred stock the remaining proceeds along with
another 148 million from employee stock option exercises were used to reduce
debt and pay dividends from year end 1999 to year end 2000 we reduced debt by
24 million

     we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit
concentrating on the highest expectedreturn opportunities and from synergistic
acquisitions we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current
industry environment enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term

financial condition

capital resources and liquidity

     our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas
properties and assetbased borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves our
level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors including the price of
natural gas and oil our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our
ability to control and reduce costs demand for

                                       24

natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized
by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however in the
summer of 2000 our realized gas prices began to climb to unseasonably high
levels and by january 2001 we realized the highest prices in the companys
history then in 2001 our realized natural gas price declined throughout the
year to a low of 232 per mcf in december a mild winter and the economic
recession may be contributing factors in the 2001 pricing volatility

     the primary sources of cash during 2001 were funds generated from
operations proceeds from the issuance of notes see note 5 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements and to a lesser extent proceeds from the
sale of stock funds were used primarily for exploration and development
expenditures including the acquisition of cody company in august 2001 and
dividend payments

     we had a net cash outflow of 19 million during 2001 the net cash inflow
from operating activities of 2504 million combined with the increase in debt
of 1240 million to substantially fund the 3861 million of cash used for
capital and exploration expenditures cash proceeds from the sales of non
strategic assets and the sale of stock combined to provide an additional 146
million of cash flow

     cash flows provided by operating activities in 2001 were 1314 million
higher than in 2000 and cash flows provided by operating activities in 2000 were
265 million higher than in 1999 these improvements were primarily a result of
increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and to a lesser extent
to increased natural gas and oil production

cash portion of the cody company acquisition additionally capital spending for
drilling and facilities increased 395 million or 49 from last year to
1195 million we drilled 208 gross wells which represents a 61 increase over
2000

     cash flows used by investing activities in 2000 were attributable to

issuing 170 million in a private placement of notes in july 2001 used to
partially fund the cody company acquisition partially offsetting this debt
increase was the reduction to the balance outstanding on the revolving credit
facility and the may 2001 prepayment of 16 million in debt that was due in may
2002

     cash flows provided by financing activities in 2000 included 851 million

     we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks the revolving
term of which runs to december 2003 the available credit line under this
facility currently 250 million is subject to adjustment on the basis of the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets
accordingly oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation since
the current price environment remains volatile management can not predict how
future price levels may change the banks longterm price outlook to reduce the
impact of any redetermination we strive to manage our debt at a level below the
available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity at year
end this excess capacity totaled 127 million or 51 of the total available
credit line management believes it has the ability to finance if necessary
our capital requirements including acquisitions oil and gas prices also affect
the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance please
read note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more
detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility

     in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the
outstanding level of borrowings we have a period of 180 days to reduce our
outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line the revolving credit agreement
also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the
adjusted credit line within the first 90 days of any adjustment

     our 2002 interest expense is expected to be approximately 292 million
including interest on the 170 million 733 weighted average fixed rate notes
used to partially fund the acquisition of cody company in may 2001 a 16
million principal payment was made on the 1018 notes this amount had been
reflected as current portion of longterm debt on the balance sheet
additionally the final 16 million payment on these notes that was due in may
2002 was paid in may 2001 using existing capacity on the revolving credit

     during 2001 dividends were paid on our common stock totaling 48 million
we have paid quarterly common stock dividends of 004 per share since becoming
publicly traded in 1990 the amount of future dividends is determined by our
board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors including future
earnings financial condition and capital requirements

     in may 2000 we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the
holder for 516 million since this stock had been recorded at a stated value
of 567 million on our balance sheet we realized a negative dividend to
preferred stockholders of 51 million we received net proceeds of 715
million from the sale of 34 million shares of common stock in a public offering
primarily to fund this transaction after repurchasing the preferred stock the
excess proceeds were used to reduce debt

capital and exploration expenditures

     on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration
activities excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions with cash
generated from operations we budget these capital expenditures based on our
projected cash flows for the year

               of the cody acquisition and excludes the 780 million deferred
               tax grossup see note 14 cody acquisition

     total capital and exploration expenditures for 2001 increased 3308
million compared to 2000 primarily as a result of the 2312 million cody
acquisition the remaining increase of 996 million was due primarily to
increased drilling activity as well as increases in leasehold acquisitions costs
consistent with our future drilling plans the 2001 drilling program included an
over 68 increase in net wells drilled and a 153 million increase in
geological and geophysical expenses including costs of obtaining seismic data
that supports future drilling programs

     we plan to drill 121 gross wells in 2002 compared with 208 gross wells
drilled in 2001  this 2002 drilling program includes 1046 million in total
capital and exploration expenditures down from 4534 million in 2001 which
was our largest capital program to date  expected spending in 2002 includes
626 million for drilling and dry hole exposure 78 million for lease
acquisition and 99 million in geological and geophysical expenses  in
addition to the drilling and exploration program other 2002 capital
expenditures are planned primarily for production equipment and for gathering
and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction  we will continue to
assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the
capital and exploration expenditures accordingly

potential impact of our critical accounting policies

     readers of this document and users of the information contained in it
should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on
the accounting policies in place the three most significant policies are
discussed below

commodity pricing and risk management activities

     our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow
funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for
natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and gas prices may
materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity ability to
obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce
the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil
and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely
and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future
would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular
substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could
potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets when adopted
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas
prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results

     the majority of production is sold at market responsive prices generally
if the commodity indexes fall the price that we receive for our production will
also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially
determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this
price risk in a number of ways most recently we have used financial
instruments such as natural gas price collar arrangements to reduce the impact
of declining pricing on our revenue under a price collar arrangement there is
also risk that the index prices will rise above the ceiling price and the
company will not be able to realize the full benefit of the market improvement

     we covered 16 of our production in 2000 with natural gas price collar
arrangements and prices rose above the ceiling during some months if we had not
had these collars in place in 2000 our realized natural gas price would have
been 017 per mcf higher in 2001 we covered 35 of our natural gas production
with price collar arrangements and prices were below the floor for several
months the gains from the 2001 price collars improved our annual realized
natural gas price by 050 per mcf

successful efforts method of accounting

     we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and
unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including
seismic purchases and processing exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs
of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred during
2001 we drilled 30 exploratory wells and 18 of them were unsuccessful adding
379 million to exploration expense this 40 success rate for exploratory
wells is not unusual and as we focus more on our exploration program we are
exposed to the risk of dry hole expense development costs including the costs
to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs
to locate proved reserves are capitalized

     we are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our
assets exceeds their future expected cash flows this may occur if a field
discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a
level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field we
determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a
result of the annual review of all fields the impairment of unamortized capital
costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is
determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net
book value

oil and gas reserves

     the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently
uncertain and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground
accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact
manner the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysic
engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this
technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions
some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices drilling and
operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds the
accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of

              the quality and quantity of available data

              the interpretation of that data

              the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and

              the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate

     our proved reserve information included in this document is based on
estimates we prepared estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than
our estimates

      because these estimates depend on many assumptions all of which may
substantially differ from actual results reserve estimates may be different
from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered
in addition results of drilling testing and production after the date of an
estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate

      you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is
the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves
in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net
cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices
and costs as of the date of the estimate

     our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization expense
dda is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves if the estimates of
proved reserves declines the rate at which we record dda expense increases
reducing net income such a decline may result from lower market prices which
may make it noneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields in
addition the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our
annual impairment test under sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets when adopted

operating risks and insurance coverage

     our business involves a variety of operating risks including

    blowouts cratering and explosions

    mechanical problems

    uncontrolled flows of oil natural gas or well fluids

    fires

    formations with abnormal pressures

    pollution and other environmental risks and

    natural disasters

     the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also
involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental
hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near
populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and
industrial sites could increase these risks any of these events could result
in loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution
impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us in accordance with
customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of
these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered
by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
results of operations the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat
dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we
choose to operate during the past few years we have drilled a higher
percentage of our wells in the gulf coast where insurance rates are
significantly higher than in other regions such as appalachia


other issues and contingencies

     corporate income tax we generate tax credits for the production of certain
qualified fuels including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and
devonian shale the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight
gas sands amounts to 052 per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to 2003 from
qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992 a number of wells drilled in the
appalachian region and rocky mountains during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the
tight gas sands tax credit the credit for natural gas produced from devonian
shale is estimated to be 108 per mmbtu in 2001 in 1995 and 1996 we completed
three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits resulting in
revenues of 20 million in 2001 and an estimated 21 million in 2002 see note
13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

     we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the
alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national
energy policy act of 1992 the act the act repealed provisions of the amt
requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on
account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion
deductions the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years
beginning after 1992 the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a
taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of
such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference

     regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by
federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas
production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other
business matters section of item 1 business for a discussion of these
regulations

     restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types
of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the companys
various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit
agreement and the notes see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to
interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 at december 31
2001 the calculated ratio for 2001 was 100 to 10 in the unforeseen event
that we fail to comply with these covenants the company may apply for a
temporary waiver with the bank which if granted would allow us a period of
time to remedy the situation see further discussion in capital resources and
liquidity and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for
further discussion

conclusion

     our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of
natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive
terms the average produced natural gas sales price received by us has changed
from yeartoyear as follows

     2001 increased 37 over 2000 to 436 per mcf
     2000 increased 44 over 1999 to 319 per mcf
     1999 increased 3 over 1998 to 222 per mcf
     1998 decreased 15 from 1997 to 216 per mcf
     1997 increased 8 over 1996 to 253 per mcf

the volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in 2002
with wide price swings in daytoday trading on the nymex futures market  given
this continued price volatility we can not predict with certainty what pricing
levels will be in the future  because future cash flows are subject to these
variables there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash
sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures

     while our 2002 plan now includes 1046 million in capital and exploration
spending we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our 2002
spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements
including if necessary reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or
common stock dividends  we believe our capital resources supplemented with
external financing if necessary are adequate to meet our capital requirements

recently issued accounting pronouncements

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statements of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations
sfas 141 and no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142
sfas 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be
accounted for under the purchase method for all business combinations for which
the date of acquisition is after june 30 2001 sfas 141 also establishes
specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from
goodwill sfas 141 also requires unallocated negative goodwill in a case where
the purchase price is less than fair market value of the acquired assets to be
written off immediately as an extraordinary gain rather than deferred and
amortized sfas 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets after an acquisition the most significant changes made by sfas 142 are
1 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized 2 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives must be
tested for impairment at least annually and 3 the amortization period for
intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years
the company does not believe that the adoption of these statements will have a
material effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows

     in june 2001 the fasb also approved for issuance sfas 143 asset
retirement obligations sfas 143 establishes accounting requirements for
retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets such as wells
and production facilities sfas 143 guidance covers 1 the timing of the
liability recognition 2 initial measurement of the liability 3 allocation
of asset retirement cost to expense 4 subsequent measurement of the liability
and 5 financial statement disclosures sfas 143 requires that an asset
retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long
lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and
rational method the company will adopt the statement effective no later than
january 1 2003 as required the transition adjustment resulting from the
adoption of sfas 143 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate the
effect of the adoption of this statement on its financial position results of
operations or cash flows

     in august 2001 the fasb also approved sfas 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of long

                                       31
page

lived assets sfas 144 sfas 144 replaces sfas 121 accounting for the
impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of
the new accounting model for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale applies
to all longlived assets including discontinued operations and replaces the
provisions of apb opinion no 30 reporting results of operationsreporting the
effects of disposal of a segment of a business for the disposal of segments of
a business sfas 144 requires that those longlived assets be measured at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell whether reported in
continuing operations or in discontinued operations therefore discontinued
operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts
for operating losses that have not yet occurred sfas 144 also broadens the
reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with
operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will
be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal
transaction the provisions of sfas 144 are effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 and generally are to
be applied prospectively at this time the company cannot estimate the effect
of this statement on its financial position results of operations or cash
flows

     these selected items impacted our financial results because they are not a
part of our normal business we have isolated their effects in the table above
these selected items for 2001 were as follows

    the change in derivative fair value 2001 related to the adoption of sfas
     133 on january 1 2001 see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated
     financial statements for further discussion

          previously paid in louisiana that recently qualified for the severance
          tax relief program as deep wells

         a total impairment of 42 million 69 million pretax recorded in
          2001 two fields in the gulf coast region were impaired in the third
          quarter since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted
          cash flows also one natural gas processing plant in the rocky
          mountains area was written down to fair market value in the fourth
          quarter the starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was impaired

         as a result of the enron bankruptcy we recorded 14 million 23
          million pretax of bad debt expense primarily related to physical
          natural gas sales made to enron in november 2001

these selected items for 2000 were as follows

         a 91 million impairment 56 million after tax was recorded on the
          beaurline field in south texas as a result of a casing collapse in two
          of the fields wells

         as a result of repurchasing all of the preferred stock at less than
          the book value we recorded a 51 million negative stock dividend in
          may 2000

         miscellaneous net revenue primarily from the settlement of a natural
          gas sales contract was recorded in the first quarter 14 million
          after tax see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial
          statements for further discussion

         as a result of bankruptcy proceedings of two of our customers we
          recorded 21 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter 13
          million after tax

         we announced the closure of the regional office in pittsburgh in may
          2000 and recorded costs of 10 million 06 million after tax
          these costs were recorded in the income statement categories that will
          receive the future savings benefit 06 million in operations 01
          million in exploration and 03 million in administration

these selected items for 1999 were as follows

         we had a 15year cogeneration contract under which we sold
          approximately 20 of our western region natural gas per year the
          contract was due to expire in 2008 but during 1999 we reached an
          agreement with the counterparty under which the counterparty bought
          out the remainder of the contract for 12 million this transaction
          completed in december 1999 accelerated the realization of any future
          price premium that may have been associated with the contract and
          added 12 million of pretax other revenue 73 million after tax
          we simultaneously sold forward a similar quantity of western region
          gas production through april 2001 at similar prices to those in the
          old contract the natural gas sales price stated in this new contract
          was significantly below yearend 2000 market prices in the region see
          note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for
          further discussion

         in the fourth quarter of 1999 we recorded impairments totaling 7
          million on two of our producing fields in the gulf coast region 43
          million after tax the chimney bayou field was impaired by 66
          million due to a significant reserve revision on the broussard
          middleton 1r well in connection with a decline in its natural gas
          production accompanied by a marked increase in water production the
          broussardmiddleton 1r was the only producing well in this field the
          lawson field was impaired by 04 million due to an unsuccessful
          workover on one of its wells

         we recorded a 4 million gain on the sale of certain nonstrategic oil
          and gas assets most notably the clarksburg properties in the
          appalachian region sold to enervest effective october 1999 24
          million after tax

         we recorded a 12 million reserve against other revenue for certain
          wells no longer deemed to be eligible for the section 29 tight gas
          sands credit following an industry tax court ruling 07 million
          after tax late in 1999 the ferc issued a rule proposal that may
          ultimately restore the eligibility for some or all of the wells in
          question for an update on the fercs actions please read note 13 of

2001 and 2000 compared

          the following discussion is based on our results before taking into
account the selected items discussed above

          net income and revenues we reported net income in 2001 of 519
million or 171 per share during 2000 we reported net income of 302
million or 110 per share operating income increased 285 million or 38
and operating revenues increased 806 million or 22 in 2001 the improvement
in operating revenues was mainly a result of the 1073 million rise in natural
gas sales due to the increases in both natural gas prices and production and
the 220 million increase in crude oil sales revenue natural gas revenue and
our realized price were bolstered by a 346 million gain on natural gas price
collar arrangements used during 2001 see further discussion in item 7a these
improvements were partially offset by a decline in brokered natural gas volume
that reduced operating revenues by 504 million operating income was similarly
impacted by these revenue changes

          the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose 065
per mcf or 17 to 444 increasing operating revenues by approximately 166
million in the western region the average natural gas production sales price
increased 102 per mcf or 36 to 388 increasing operating revenues by
approximately 267 million the average appalachian natural gas production
sales price increased 172 per mcf or 53 to 496 increasing operating
revenues by approximately 299 million the overall weighted average natural
gas production sales price increased 117 per mcf or 37 to 436 per mcf in
2001

          natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up 115
bcf or 82 to 256 bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in
south louisiana and production from the cody company properties acquired in
august 2001 natural gas production volume in the western region was down 28
bcf or 10 to 262 bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in
the midcontinent area during the past three years natural gas production
volume in the appalachian region was down 04 bcf or 2 to 174 bcf as a
result of lower than anticipated success of the oriskany drilling program in the
region in late 2000 and into 2001 total natural gas production was up 83 bcf
or 14 in 2001

          crude oil prices fell 190 per bbl or 7 to 2491 resulting in a
decrease to operating revenues of approximately 36 million the volume of
crude oil sold in the year doubled to 1908 mbbls increasing operating revenues
by 256 million this production increase was a result of our 2000 drilling
success in south louisiana 80 increase and the acquisition of cody company
20 increase

          brokered natural gas revenue decreased 504 million or 36 from the
prior year the sales price of brokered natural gas rose 37 resulting in an
increase in revenue of 245 million the volume of natural gas brokered this
year declined by 53 reducing revenues by 749 million after including the
related brokered natural gas costs we realized a net margin of 29 million in
2001 compared to a net margin of 54 million in 2000

          excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in
2000 other operating revenues increased 16 million to 71 million this
increase in 2001 is primarily the result of a settlement received as a result of
a lawsuit and increased revenue from the sale of natural gas liquids

          costs and expenses total costs and expenses from operations
excluding the selected items related to the impairment of longlived assets and
bad debt in each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office
in pittsburgh during 2000 increased 521 million or 18 from 2000 due
primarily to the following

         brokered natural gas cost decreased 479 million or 35 primarily
          due to the 730 million impact of the lower volume of brokered sales
          in 2001 this was partially offset by a 251 million increase due to
          higher natural gas costs compared to the prior year

         production and pipeline expense increased 60 million or 17
          primarily as a result of costs associated with operating the cody
          company properties acquired in august 2001 additionally increased
          staffing and insurance costs were incurred to support the expanded
          2001 drilling program on a unitsofproduction basis our company
          wide production and pipeline expense was 051 per mcfe in 2001 versus
          053 per mcfe in 2000 as a result of the increased production
          discussed above

                                       35
page

         exploration expense increased 514 million or 261 primarily as a
          result of the following

              a 153 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses
               over last year due to the acquisition of seismic data for future
               evaluation and increased drilling activity in all regions

              a 349 million increase in dry hole costs although the drilling
               success rate improved from 86 in 2000 to 87 in 2001 we drilled
               a total of 208 gross wells in 2001 a 61 increase over 2000 we
               recorded seven exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf
               coast region versus only two in 2000 we also recorded four
               exploratory dry holes in the rocky mountains area and seven in
               the appalachian region for a total of 18 up from a company total
               of seven in 2000

              a 08 million increase for salaries wages and incentive
               compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the
               gulf coast region to support the expanded drilling program

         depreciation depletion amortization and impairment expense
          excluding the selected item related to the sfas 121 impairment in each
          year increased 306 million or 53 over 2000 natural gas
          equivalent production increased 21 increasing dda expense by 123
          million the 27 increase in the per unit expense from 086 per mcfe
          to 109 per mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher
          cost gulf coast region including the newly acquired cody properties
          and resulted in an 183 million increase to dda expense for 2001

         general and administrative expenses increased 55 million primarily
          as a result of increased staffing during the transition period
          following the cody company acquisition and other staffing increases
          that support our larger operations additional cost increases were
          realized in incentive compensation programs as well as technology
          updates and related software maintenance

         taxes other than income increased 64 million as a result of higher
          natural gas and oil revenues

          interest expense decreased 21 million due to a lower weighted
average interest rate realized in 2001 this was despite the new notes issued to
partially fund the acquisition of cody company in august 2001

          income tax expense was up 102 million due to the comparable increase
in earnings before income tax our effective tax rate decreased in 2001
reflecting a shift of activity between states

2000 and 1999 compared

          the following discussion is based on our results before taking into
account the selected items discussed above

          net income and revenues we reported net income in 2000 of 302
million or 110 per share during 1999 we reported net income of 04
million or 002 per share operating income increased 429 million or 135
and operating revenues increased 831 million or 29 in 2000 the improvement
in operating revenues was mainly a result of the 487 million rise in natural
gas sales due to the increase in gas prices and the 245 million increase in
brokered natural gas sales revenue operating revenues were reduced by a 10
million loss on natural gas price collar arrangements used during 2000 see
further discussion in item 7a price and production volume increases in crude
oil also contributed to the higher operating revenues operating income was
similarly impacted by these revenue changes

          the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose 150
per mcf or 66 to 379 increasing operating revenues by approximately 212
million in the western region the average natural gas production sales price
increased 090 per mcf or 46 to 286 increasing operating revenues by
approximately 249 million the average appalachian natural gas production
sales price increased 071 per mcf or 28 to 324 increasing operating
revenues by approximately 127 million the overall weighted average natural
gas production sales price increased 097 per mcf or 44 to 319 increasing
revenues by 588 million

          natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was down 14
bcf or 9 to 141 bcf primarily due to production difficulties in the
beaurline field and delays in bringing new production online in south
louisiana natural gas production volume in the western region was down 03 bcf
to 290 bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid
continent area during 1999 and 2000 natural gas production volume in the
appalachian

                                       36

region was down 29 bcf to 178 bcf as a result of the sale of certain non
strategic assets in the appalachian region effective october 1 1999 and a
decrease in drilling activity in the region total natural gas production was
down 46 bcf or 7 generating a revenue decrease of 101 million in 2000

          crude oil prices rose 959 per bbl or 56 to 2681 resulting in
an increase to operating revenues of approximately 92 million the volume of
crude oil sold in the year increased slightly to 953 mbbls increasing operating
revenues by 04 million

          brokered natural gas revenue increased 245 million or 21 over the
prior year the sales price of brokered natural gas rose 52 resulting in an
increase in revenue of 485 million the volume of natural gas brokered this
year declined by 21 reducing revenues by 240 million after including the
related brokered natural gas costs we realized a net margin of 54 million in
2000

          excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in
2000 and the sales contract buyout and the section 29 tax credit provision in
1999 other operating revenues increased 02 million to 55 million

          costs and expenses total costs and expenses from operations
excluding the selected items related to the impairment of longlived assets in
each year and the costs associated with closing the regional office in
pittsburgh during 2000 increased 402 million or 16 from 1999 due primarily
to the following

         brokered natural gas cost increased 235 million or 21 primarily
          due to the 465 million impact of higher purchased natural gas
          prices this was partially offset by a 230 million reduction to
          purchased natural cost the result of fewer brokered sales this year
          compared to the prior year

         production and pipeline expense increased 19 million or 6
          primarily as a result of costs associated with the expansion of the
          gulf coast regional office both in staffing and office facilities
          additionally operational costs for surface equipment and compressor
          maintenance were up in the rocky mountains area where we drilled 50
          more net wells in 2000 compared to 1999 on a unitsofproduction
          basis our companywide production and pipeline expense was 053 per
          mcfe in 2000 versus 047 per mcfe in 1999

         exploration expense increased 83 million or 72 primarily as a
          result of the following

              a 35 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses
               over last year due to increased drilling activity in all regions

              a 13 million increase in delay rental costs over last year
               largely due to delays in scheduled drilling projects in the gulf
               coast region

              a 21 million increase for salaries wages and incentive
               compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the
               gulf coast region to support the expanded drilling program

              a 05 million increase in dry hole costs although the drilling
               success rate improved from 84 in 1999 to 86 in 2000 we
               recorded two exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast
               region versus only one in 1999

         depreciation depletion amortization and impairment expense
          excluding the selected item related to the sfas 121 impairment in each
          year increased 05 million or 1 over 1999 a 6 decrease in total
          natural gas equivalent production caused the expense to remain just
          slightly above last years level despite the 7 increase in the per
          unit expense to 086 per mcfe

         general and administrative expenses remained at the same level as in
          1999

         taxes other than income increased 61 million as a result of higher
          natural gas and oil revenues

          interest expense decreased 29 million primarily due to lower average
levels of borrowing on the revolving credit facility

          income tax expense was up 181 million due to the comparable increase
in earnings before income tax

          no significant asset sale activity occurred in 2000 gain on the sale
of assets was 4 million for 1999 these gains are the result of the non
strategic asset divestitures primarily the sale of the clarksburg properties in

oil and gas prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of
time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business

          our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to
borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing
prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and
natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition
liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas
prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce
economically historically oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile
with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile
oil and gas prices declined substantially in 1998 and early 1999 moved higher
through 2000 and into 2001 before declining back to yearend 1998 levels in
october 2001 because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in
natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial
results

          prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in
response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and
gas market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our
control these factors include

         the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas

         the level of consumer product demand

         weather conditions

         political conditions in oil producing regions including the middle
          east

         the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting
          countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls

         the price of foreign imports

         actions of governmental authorities

         domestic and foreign governmental regulations

         the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels

         overall economic conditions

these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices
of oil and gas

          our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility
for our production in the natural gas natural gas liquids and crude oil
markets currently we are focusing on protection from natural gas price
declines particularly in light of our capital spending plans a hedging
committee that consists of members of senior management overseas our hedging
activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and
provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the
benefit to us of increases in prices please read the discussion below related
to commodity price swaps and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements

commodity price swaps and options

hedges on production  swaps

          from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap
agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of
our production these derivatives are not held for trading purposes under these
price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and
crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index
such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures during 2001 we fixed the price at
an average of 375 per mcf on quantities totaling 918 mmcf representing 1 of
the companys 2001 natural gas production we did not have crude oil swap
arrangements covering our production in 2001 during 2000 we fixed the price at
an average of 454 per mcf on quantities totaling 315 mmcf representing less

than 1 of the companys 2000 natural gas production the notional volume of the
crude oil swap transactions was 364 mbbls at a price of 2267 per bbl which
represented approximately 38 of our total oil production for 2000 during 1999
we fixed the price at an average of 288 per mcf on quantities totaling 3237
mmcf representing 5 of the companys 1999 natural gas production the notional
volume of the crude oil swap transactions was 306 mbbls at a price of 2065 per
bbl which represented approximately onethird of our total oil production for
1999

          the natural gas price swap arrangement that we entered into during the
third quarter of 2000 covered a portion of production over the period of october
2000 through september 2003 however the counterparty declared bankruptcy in
december 2001 based on the terms of the natural gas swap contract this action
resulted in the cancellation of the contract at the time of cancellation the
contracts value was less than 02 million as of the years ending december 31
2001 and 2000 we had open natural gas price swap contracts on our production
as follows



                                                                     natural gas price swaps

          financial derivatives related to natural gas production reduced
revenues by 08 million in 2001 and 03 million in 2000

          we had no open oil price swap contracts outstanding on our production
at december 31st of 2001 or 2000 financial derivatives related to crude oil
reduced revenue by 22 million during 2000 but had no impact on 2001 results

hedges on production  options

          in december 2000 we believed that the pricing environment provided a
strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our
production through the use of costless collars under the costless collar
arrangements if the index rises above the ceiling price we pay the
counterparty if the applicable index falls below the floor the counterparty
pays us the 2001 natural gas price hedges include several costless collar
arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our
production these hedges were in place for the months of february through
october 2001 and covered 24404 mmcf or 35 of our natural gas production for
the year all indexes were within the collars during february and april some
fell below the floor during the period of march and all indexes were below the
floor from june through october resulting in a 346 million cash revenue for
the year these gains contributed 050 per mcf to our average realized natural
gas price for 2001

          during 2000 we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a
portion of our natural gas production there were seven collar arrangements
based on separate regional price indexes with a weighted average price floor of
274 per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of 338 per mcf these
collars were in place during the months of april through october 2000 during
this period if the index rose above the ceiling price we paid the
counterparty if the applicable index fell below the floor price the
counterparty paid us these collars covered a total quantity of 9909 mmcf or
16 of our annual production in april and may 2000 the index prices all fell
within the price collar and no settlements were made in june 2000 all of the
indexes rose above the ceiling prices and remained above the ceiling for the
duration of the transaction resulting in a 10 million reduction to our realized
revenue for the year if these hedges had not been in place our average
realized natural gas price for 2000 would have been 017 per mcf higher

          again in december of 2001 we believed that the pricing environment
provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a
portion of our future production through the use of natural gas price collar
arrangements  as of december 31 2001 we had open natural gas price collar
arrangements to hedge our production as follows



                                                                            natural gas price collars

          the natural gas price hedges open at december 31 2001 noted above
included several collar arrangements based on nine price indexes at which we
sell a portion of our production  these hedges are in place for the months of
january through april 2002 and cover approximately 60 of our anticipated
natural gas production during this period  a premium totaling 09 million was
paid to purchase these collar arrangements

hedges on brokered transactions

          we use price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered
transactions typically we enter into contracts to broker natural gas at a
variable price based on the market index price however in some circumstances
some of our customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the
contract after entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of
our customers or suppliers we may use price swaps to effectively convert these
fixed price contracts to marketsensitive price contracts these price swaps are
held by us to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes

          we entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of 1295
mmcf in 2000 and 3572 mmcf in 1999 related to our brokered activities
representing 3 and 7 respectively of our total volume of brokered natural gas
sold we did not use price swaps on brokered transactions in 2001

          as of the years ending december 31 2000 and 2001 we had no open
natural gas price swap contracts on brokered transactions financial derivatives
related to natural gas reduced revenues by less than 01 million in 2000 and
had no impact on revenue in 2001

          we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent
of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil however the market risk
exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss
recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

adoption of sfas 133

          we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 on
january 1 2001 under sfas 133 the fair value of each derivative instrument is
recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of
each period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the
change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income a component of
equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge
under sfas 133 effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the
hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale for example a natural
gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly
correlated

                                       40
page

and 100 effective if the underlying gas was sold at the henry hub index any
portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas
133 test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the
statement of operations

          when we adopted sfas 133 we had two types of hedges in place the
first type was a cash flow hedge that set the price of a certain monthly
quantity of natural gas sold in the gulf coast region through september 2003
based on the index price strip the impact of this hedge on january 1 2001 was
to record a hedge loss of 01 million and a charge to other comprehensive
income of 42 million correspondingly a hedge liability for 43 million was
established this instrument was cancelled in december 2001 with the bankruptcy
of the counterparty no balance related to this hedge remains in other
comprehensive income

          the second type of hedge outstanding at january 1 2001 was a natural
gas price costless collar agreement we had entered into eight of these collars
for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of february
through october 2001 the collars had two components of value intrinsic value
and time value under sfas 133 both components were valued at the end of each
reporting period intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above
the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar if the
index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar the intrinsic
value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices
multiplied by the notional volume in accordance with the initial sfas 133
guidance intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a
hedge loss if the index is above the ceiling or gain if the index is below
the floor starting in 2001 under amended guidance on sfas 133 any changes in
the intrinsic value component related to future months were recorded in other
comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet
rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge was proven to
be effective these natural gas price collars were considered to be highly
effective with respect to the intrinsic value calculation since they were
tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold also under sfas 133
the time value component a market premiumdiscount was markedtomarket
through the income statement each period since these collar arrangements were
executed on the last business day of 2000 the net premium value at adoption on
january 1 2001 was zero

          as of december 31 2001 we had a series of nine natural gas price
collar arrangements in place in accordance with the latest guidance from the
fasbs derivative implementation group we test the effectiveness of the
combined intrinsic and time values and the effective portion of each will be
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income any ineffective portion
will be recorded as a gain or loss in the current period as of december 31
2001 we have recorded 14 million of other comprehensive income a 01
million unrealized hedge gain and a 15 million hedge asset

item 1   business

overview

     cabot oil  gas is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the
exploration development acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties
located in four principal areas of the united states

   the onshore texas and louisiana gulf coast
   the rocky mountains
   appalachia
   the midcontinent or anadarko basin

administratively we operate in three regions  the gulf coast region the
western region which is comprised of the rocky mountains and midcontinent
areas and the appalachian region

     until a few years ago our core holdings were longlived appalachian
natural gas reserves  we have used the cash flow from these properties
together with strategic acquisitions to shift the focus of our exploration
efforts to the gulf coast and rocky mountain areas  we believe these core
producing areas offer more value accretive reserve and production growth and
higher rates of return on equity  meanwhile we have been rationalizing our
appalachian operations by selective divestitures  in 2001 48 of our capital
budget is allocated to the gulf coast 18 to the rocky mountains 26 to
appalachia and the remaining 8 to the midcontinent area  while about 40 of
our proved reserves are located in appalachia reflecting the fact that we have
operated there for more than a century this proportion has declined as our
production and reserves in the gulf coast and rocky mountains have grown

     in 1998 we participated in a 300 square mile 3d seismic shoot with union
pacific resources group inc in south louisiana and identified several deep
highpotential exploratory prospects we have drilled five successful wells in
five attempts with one additional well drilling at the end of 2000 on these
prospects these successes include etouffee bon ton and augen our 2001
drilling plan for this acreage includes four highgrowth highpotential wells
additional exploratory opportunities exist in this prospect area concurrent
with this project we acquired 701 million of developed and undeveloped
properties from oryx energy company also in south louisiana during 1999 we
increased our gulf coast production significantly through the completion of
several workover projects on wells acquired from oryx at the same time we
actively reprocessed 3d seismic data acquired from oryx the interpretation of
which yielded five highpotential exploratory prospects one of these prospects
was successfully drilled in 2000 with another inprogress at the end of 2000
our 2001 capital spending program includes plans to drill two more of these
prospects and we expect to drill another in 2002 the success of these projects
in the gulf coast region has increased our daily production from 15 mmcfe per
day in october 1998 to over 70 mmcfe per day in december 2000 we continue to
acquire additional 3d seismic and leases in the gulf coast area in addition
our 2001 drilling program includes plans to drill additional wells in south
louisiana as we continue to focus our exploratory efforts on this highgrowth
highpotential region

     as of december 31 2000 our proved reserves totaled just over 10 tcfe
94 of which was natural gas  we operate approximately 83 of the wells in
which we hold an interest  daily production averaged 1805 mmcfe per day during
the first nine months of the year before increasing to approximately 185 mmcfe
per day in october and november  december was the first month in which we
reached full production rates from our recent exploratory wells in south
louisiana which brought the average for that month to approximately 197 mmcfe
per day

gulf coast region

     our exploration development and production activities in gulf coast region
are concentrated in south louisiana and south texas  a regional office in
houston manages operations  principal producing intervals are in the wilcox and
vicksburg formations in texas and the miocene age formations in louisiana at
depths ranging from 3000 to 20500 feet  capital and exploration expenditures
were 660 million in 2000 or 54 of our total 2000 capital and exploration
expenditures and 368 million for 1999  our drilling and acquisition program
has increased average daily production in the region from 156 mmcfe per day in
1994 when we acquired our first gulf coast properties from washington energy
to 713 mmcfe per day in december 2000  for 2001 we have budgeted 793
million 48 of our total 2001 capital budget for capital expenditures in the
region  our 2001 gulf coast drilling program emphasizes our exploration
opportunities

     we had 384 productive wells 2926 net in the gulf coast region as of
december 31 2000 of which 228 wells are operated by us  average net daily
production in 2000 was 495 mmcfe down from 520 mmcfe in 1999 due to delays in
bringing production online early in 2000 from new wells not operated by us
however production from our drilling activity which came on later in the year
brought the average daily production rate to 713 mmcfe for the month of
december 2000  at december 31 2000 we had 1440 bcfe of proved reserves 74
natural gas in the gulf coast region which was 14 of our total proved
reserves

     in 2000 we drilled 23 wells 112 net in the gulf coast region of which
17 wells 80 net were development wells  we did not begin to realize the full
impact of our drilling successes in this region until late 2000  at year end
the south louisiana etouffee prospect along with our new discoveries in the
augen krescent and bon ton prospects in south louisiana contributed to the
significant growth in net proved reserves  in the gulf coast region we plan to
drill 29 wells in 2001

     at december 31 2000 we had 111430 net acres in the region including
50673 net developed and we had identified 13 proved undeveloped drilling
locations

     our principal markets for gulf coast region natural gas are in the
industrialized gulf coast area and the northeastern united states  our
marketing subsidiary cabot oil  gas marketing corporation purchases all of
our natural gas production in the gulf coast region  the marketing subsidiary
sells the natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and
marketing companies

                                       4
page

     currently the majority of our natural gas sales volumes in the gulf coast
region are sold at indexbased prices under contracts with terms of one to three
years  from time to time we may also use hedges on a portion of our production
to reduce the potential risk of falling prices when we believe market conditions
are favorable  the gulf coast properties are connected to various processing
plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate
deliveries affording us access to multiple markets

     we also produce and market approximately 2000 barrels per day of crude
oilcondensate in the gulf coast region at marketresponsive prices


western region

     our activities in the western region are managed by a regional office in
denver  at december 31 2000 we had 4642 bcfe of proved reserves 96 natural
gas in the western region constituting 46 of our total proved reserves

rocky mountains

     our rocky mountains activities are concentrated in the green river basin
and washakie basin of wyoming  since our initial acquisition in the area in
1994 from washington energy we have increased reserves from 1716 bcfe at
december 31 1994 to 2461 bcfe at december 31 2000  capital and exploration
expenditures were 239 million for 2000 or 20 of our total 2000 capital and
exploration expenditures and 295 million for 1999 including 174 million
for property acquisitions  for 2001 we have budgeted 296 million 18 of our
total 2001 capital budget for capital expenditures in the area  the 2001
drilling program consists of several new exploration plays complemented by
development drilling

     we had 490 productive wells 2282 net in the rocky mountains area as of
december 31 2000 of which 239 wells are operated by us  principal producing
intervals in the rocky mountains area are in the frontier and dakota formations
at depths ranging from 9000 to 13500 feet  average net daily production in
2000 was 512 mmcfe

     in 2000 we drilled 26 wells 158 net in the rocky mountains of which 25
wells 153 net were development and extension wells  in 2001 we plan to
drill 46 wells

     at december 31 2000 we had 199768 net acres in the area including
81940 net developed acres and we had identified 81 proved undeveloped drilling
locations

midcontinent

     our midcontinent activities are concentrated in the anadarko basin in
southwestern kansas oklahoma and the panhandle of texas  capital and
exploration expenditures were 76 million for 2000 or 6 of our total 2000
capital and exploration expenditures and 41 million for 1999  for 2001 we
have budgeted 135 million 8 of our total 2001 capital budget for capital
expenditures in the area

     as of december 31 2000 we had 672 productive wells 4472 net in the
midcontinent area of which 498 wells are operated by us  principal producing
intervals in the midcontinent are in the chase morrow red fork and chester
formations at depths ranging from 1500 to 14000 feet  average net daily
production in 2000 was 328 mmcfe  at december 31 2000 we had 2181 bcfe of
proved reserves 97 natural gas in the midcontinent area 21 of our total
proved reserves

     in 2000 we drilled 19 wells 126 net in the midcontinent of which 18
wells 123 net were development and extension wells  in 2001 we plan to
drill 35 wells

     at december 31 2000 we had 197641 net acres in the area including
184399 net developed acres and we had identified 67 proved undeveloped
drilling locations

western region marketing

     our principal markets for western region natural gas are in the
northwestern midwestern and northeastern united states  cabot oil  gas
marketing purchases all of our natural gas production in the western region
this marketing subsidiary sells the natural gas to power generators natural gas
processors local distribution companies industrial customers and marketing
companies

     currently the majority of our natural gas production in the western region
is sold primarily under contracts with a term of one to three years at index
based prices  from time to time we may also use hedges on a portion of our
production to reduce the potential risk of falling prices when we believe market
conditions are favorable  the western region properties are connected to the
majority of the midwestern and northwestern interstate and intrastate pipelines
affording us access to multiple markets

     in december 1999 we negotiated the buyout of a longterm fixed price
sales contract that covered approximately 20 of the western region natural gas
production and expired in june 2008  we received a payment of 12 million as
part of this buyout agreement  this contract was then replaced with a fixed
price sales contract that expires in april 2001  the fixed natural gas sales
price in both the original natural gas sales contract and the replacement sales
contract was below the market price at year end  after april 2001 we expect
that this production will be sold at market responsive prices

     we also produce and market approximately 700 barrels of crude
oilcondensate per day in the western region at marketresponsive prices

appalachian region

     our appalachian activities are concentrated in pennsylvania ohio west
virginia and virginia  we believe that our large undeveloped acreage position
high concentration of wells natural gas gathering and pipeline systems and
storage capacity give us a competitive advantage in the region  we have
achieved a drilling success rate of 89 in the region since 1991  capital and
exploration expenditures were 215 million for 2000 or 18 of our total 2000
capital spending and 146 million for 1999  for 2001 we have budgeted 431
million 26 of our total 2001 capital budget for capital expenditures in the
region

     at december 31 2000 we had 2243 productive wells 20792 net of which
2177 wells are operated by us  there are multiple producing intervals that
include the devonian shale oriskany berea and big lime formations at depths
primarily ranging from 1500 to 9000 feet  average net daily production in
2000 was 492 mmcfe  while natural gas production volumes from appalachian
reservoirs are relatively low on a perwell basis compared to other areas of the
united states the productive life of appalachian reserves is relatively long
at december 31 2000 we had 4106 bcfe of proved reserves substantially all
natural gas in the appalachian region constituting 40 of our total proved
reserves  a regional office in pittsburgh managed operations in this region
until its closure in mid 2000  currently this region is managed from our office
in charleston west virginia

     in 2000 we drilled 61 wells 520 net in the appalachian region of which
52 wells 457 net were development wells  in 2001 we plan to drill 130
wells

     at december 31 2000 we had 1044525 net acres in the region including
743540 net developed and we had identified 271 proved undeveloped drilling
locations

     the principal markets for our appalachian region natural gas are in the
northeastern united states  cabot oil  gas marketing purchases our natural gas
production in the appalachian region as well as production from local third
party producers and other suppliers to aggregate larger volumes of natural gas
for resale  this marketing subsidiary sells natural gas to industrial
customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our
pipeline and gathering system

     most of our natural gas sales volume in the appalachian region is sold at
indexbased prices under contracts with a term of one year or less  of these
shortterm sales spot market sales are made under monthtomonth contracts
while industrial and utility sales generally are made under yeartoyear
contracts  approximately 5 of appalachian production is sold on fixed price
contracts that typically renew annually  from time to time we

                                       6
page

may also use hedges on a portion of our production to reduce the potential risk
of falling prices when we believe market conditions are favorable

     our appalachian natural gas production has historically sold at a higher
realized price or premium compared to production from other producing regions
due to its proximity to northeastern markets  while yeartoyear fluctuations
in that premium are normal due to changes in market conditions this premium has
typically been in the range of 040 to 050 per mmbtu above the henry hub cash
price throughout the 1990s  in 1999 however the average premium declined to
027 per mmbtu due to increases in supply in the eastern market  this decline
continued into early 2000  however late in 2000 and into early 2001 the
premium has begun to increase again due to strengthening of demand and perceived
market shortages  the average 2000 premium was approximately 030 per mmbtu
due to this recent volatility we are not able to predict the level of this
premium for the future

     ancillary to our exploration and production operations we operate a number
of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately
2450 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission
systems seven local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end
of 2000  the majority of our pipeline infrastructure in west virginia is
regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  as such the
transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry
pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc  our
natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems enable us to connect new
wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to
interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users
control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to
purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties  in
addition we can take part in development drilling operations without relying
upon third parties to transport our natural gas while incurring only the
incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system

     we have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a
combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf  we use these storage fields
to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas and
the higher prices typically associated with winter natural gas sales while
maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year  the
storage fields also enable us to periodically increase the volume of natural gas
that we can deliver by more than 40 above the volume that we could deliver
solely from our production in the appalachian region  the pipeline systems and
storage fields are fully integrated with our operations

     in addition we own and operate two brine treatment plants that process and
treat waste fluid generated during the drilling completion and production of
oil and gas wells  the first plant near franklin pennsylvania began
operating in 1985  it provides services primarily to other oil and gas
producers in southwestern new york eastern ohio and western pennsylvania  in
april 1998 we acquired a second brine treatment plant in indiana pennsylvania
that had been in existence since 1987

risk management

     from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we
use certain financial instruments called derivatives to manage price risks
associated with our production and brokering activities  while there are many
different types of derivatives available in 2000 we primarily employed natural
gas and oil price swap and costless collar agreements to attempt to manage price
risk more effectively   the price swaps call for payments to or receipts from
counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and a variable gas
price  the costless collar arrangements are put and call options used to
establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production
during a certain time period  they provide for payments to counterparties if
the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the
index price is below the floor

     in december 2000 we entered into certain costless collar arrangements on
half of our natural gas production for the months of february through october
2001 we have not traditionally used derivatives to hedge a large portion of our
natural gas production hedging only 9 of our total natural gas production with
derivatives in the last five years we will continue to evaluate the benefit of
employing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations  commodity price
swaps and options for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives

1 liquids include crude oil condensate and natural gas liquids ngl
2 natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6 mcf of natural
      gas to 1 bbl of crude oil condensate or natural gas liquids

     the proved reserve estimates presented here were prepared by our petroleum
engineering staff and reviewed by miller and lents ltd independent petroleum
engineers  for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves
the review of such estimates by miller and lents ltd and other information
about our oil and gas reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to
the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 a copy of the review
letter by miller and lents ltd has been filed as an exhibit to this form 10k
our estimates of proved reserves in the table above are consistent with those
filed by us with other federal agencies our reserves are sensitive to natural
gas and crude oil sales prices and their effect on economic producing rates our
reserves are based on oil and gas index prices in effect on the last day of
december 2000 while the high yearend natural gas price had a significant
impact on the present value of proved reserves as presented in the supplemental
oil and gas information discussion beginning on page 61 our reserve volumes did
not change appreciably due to the higher prices

     there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proved reserves including many factors beyond our control  therefore the
reserve information in this form 10k represents only estimates  reserve
engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact manner  the
accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data
and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment  as a result
estimates of different engineers often vary  in addition results of drilling
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify
revising the original estimate  accordingly reserve estimates are often
different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately
recovered  the meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the
accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based  in general the volume
of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted
except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves
or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both our proved
reserves will decline as reserves are produced

competition

     competition in our primary producing areas is intense  price contract
terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution
efficiencies and reliable delivery records affect competition  we believe that
our extensive acreage position and existing natural gas gathering and pipeline
systems and storage fields give us a competitive advantage over other producers
in the appalachian region who do not have similar systems or facilities in
place  we believe that our competitive position in the appalachian region is
enhanced by the lack of significant competition from major oil and gas
companies  we also actively compete against other companies with substantially
larger financial and other resources particularly in the western and gulf coast
regions

other business matters

major customer

     we had no sales to any customer that exceeded 10 of our total gross
revenues in 2000 or 1999

seasonality

     demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and
typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months

regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production

     exploration and production operations are subject to various types of
regulation at the federal state and local levels  such regulation includes
requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or
operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and
casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are
drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells  our operations are also
subject to various conservation laws and regulations  these include the
regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the
density of wells which may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or
pooling of oil and natural gas properties  some states allow the forced pooling
or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on
voluntary pooling of lands and leases  in addition state conservation laws
establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally
prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain
requirements regarding the ratability of production  the effect of these
regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from
our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill
because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often
are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future
cost or impact of regulatory compliance  the regulatory burden on the oil and
gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its
profitability  we do not believe however we are affected materially
differently by these regulations than others in the industry

natural gas marketing gathering and transportation

     federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the
price of the natural gas produced and the manner in which such production is
transported and marketed  under the natural gas act of 1938 the ferc regulates
the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas for resale  the fercs
jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales was substantially modified by the
natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa under which the ferc continued to
regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of gas sold in first
sales in interstate and intrastate commerce  effective january 1 1993
however the natural gas wellhead decontrol act decontrol act deregulated
natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas including all sales of
our own production  as a result all of our produced natural gas may now be
sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be
in effect  the fercs jurisdiction over natural gas transportation and the sale
for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce was not affected by the
decontrol act

     natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas
transportation regulation  beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing
through order no 636 in 1992 the ferc adopted regulatory changes that have
significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas  these
changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things
transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesaler marketers
of gas to the primary role of gas transporters  order no 636 required that
interstate pipelines generally cease making sales of natural gas  at the same
time ferc retained its statutory jurisdiction over the sale for resale of
natural gas in interstate commerce but issued to all entities except
interstate pipelines a blanket certificate to make sales for resale of natural
gas in interstate commerce at market based prices as a result pipelines
divested their gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate
separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other
merchants  as a result of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the
late 1980s and early 1990s and the individual pipeline restructuring
proceedings of the early to mid1990s the interstate pipelines are now required
to provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated
services to all producers gas marketing companies local distribution
companies industrial end users and other customers seeking service the ferc
expanded the impact of open access regulations to intrastate commerce through
its

                                       14
page

implementation of the ngpa provisions allowing intrastate pipelines to provide
service in intrastate commerce on behalf of interstate pipelines

     more recently the ferc has pursued other policy initiatives that have
affected natural gas marketing  most notable are 1 the largescale
divestiture of interstate pipelineowned gas gathering facilities to affiliated
or nonaffiliated companies which is a result of the fercs requirement in
order no 636 that interstate pipelines unbundle gathering services from
transportation services 2 further development of rules governing the
relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates 3 the
publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and
electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make available transportation
information on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely
electronic basis 4 further refinement of  transactions permitted in the
secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open
access service in the primary market and 5 development of policy and
promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of marketbased rates
rather than traditional costofservice based rates for transportation or
transportationrelated services upon a showing of lack of market control in the
relevant service market  it remains to be seen what effect the fercs other
activities will have on access to markets the fostering of competition and the
cost of doing business

     as a result of these changes sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct
access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to
conduct business with a larger number of counterparties  we believe these
changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time
substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace

     we can not predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other
regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on
our activities  similarly it is impossible to predict what proposals if any
that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by
congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such
proposals might have on us  similarly and despite the trend toward federal
deregulation of the natural gas industry whether or to what extent that trend
will continue or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas can not
be predicted

     our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for
safety compliance by the us department of transportation and the west virginia
public service commission

federal regulation of petroleum

     our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are at
market prices  the price received from the sale of these products is affected
by the cost of transporting the products to market  much of that transportation
is through interstate common carrier pipelines  effective january 1 1995 the
ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved
interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those
rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation
subject to certain conditions and limitations  these regulations may tend to
increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate
pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a
given year  these regulations have generally been approved on judicial review
every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual
change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the
oil pipeline industry  the first such review has been completed and on december
14 2000 the ferc reaffirmed the current index  we are not able to predict
with certainty the effect upon us of these relatively new federal regulations or
of the periodic review by the ferc of the index

environmental regulations

     general  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local
laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission
transportation and discharge of materials into the environment  permits are
required for the operation of our various facilities  these permits can be
revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities  governmental authorities
enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both
government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing
and operating oil and gas facilities  although we believe that compliance with
environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks
of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues
are part of oil and gas production operations  no assurance can be given that
significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred

                                       15
page

also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental
laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting
from oil and gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to
us

     solid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past
owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil
and gas for many years  although operating and disposal practices that were
standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that
hydrocarbons or other solid wastes may have been disposed of or released on or
under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws
applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become more strict over
time  under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to
remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or
released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination
including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform
plugging operations to prevent future contamination

     we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal
resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes
the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for
certain hazardous wastes  it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt
from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous
wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes  we could therefore be subject
to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we
encounter today

     superfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and
liability act cercla also known as the superfund law imposes liability
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain
persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the
environment  these persons include the owner and operator of a site and any
party that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances
found at a site  cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private
parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to
recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties  in the course
of business we have generated and will continue to generate wastes that may
fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances  we may also be an
owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released  as
a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to
clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed  see item 3 legal
proceedings for a discussion of the casmalia superfund site

     oil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and
resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties
related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from
such spills in waters of the united states  the term waters of the united
states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including
wetlands and intermittent streams  the opa assigns liability to each
responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private
damages

     clean water act  the federal water pollution control act fwpca or clean
water act and resulting regulations which are implemented through a system of
permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the
united states  sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water
act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified
deficiencies  however regulatory agencies could require us to cease
construction or operation of certain facilities that are the source of water
discharges  we believe that we comply with the clean water act and related
federal and state regulations in all material respects

     clean air act  our operations are subject to local state and federal laws
and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution  payment of
fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties
for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits  regulatory
agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain
facilities that are air emission sources  we believe that we substantially
comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and
regulations

employees

     as of december 31 2000 cabot oil  gas had 323 active employees  we
recognize that our success is significantly influenced by the relationship we
maintain with our employees  overall we believe that our relations with our
employees are satisfactory  the company and its employees are not represented
by a collective bargaining agreement

                                       16
page

     in may 2000 we announced the closure of our regional office in pittsburgh
pennsylvania  approximately 15 jobs were eliminated as a result of this action
while the remaining positions were either transferred to existing offices in
charleston west virginia and houston texas or remained in smaller facilities
in pittsburgh

     in january 1999 we instituted a reorganization plan that resulted in a 6
reduction in the number of active employees  in september 1999 we completed
the divestiture of certain properties in the appalachian region that effectively
transferred 19 active employees to the acquiring company

other

     our profitability depends on certain factors that are beyond our control
such as natural gas and crude oil prices  please see item 7  we face a variety
of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses  our
business involves a variety of operating risks including blowouts cratering
explosions and fires mechanical problems uncontrolled flows of oil natural
gas or well fluids formations with abnormal pressures pollution and other
environmental risks and natural disasters  we conduct operations in shallow
offshore areas which are subject to additional hazards of marine operations
such as capsizing collision and damage from severe weather

     our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves
various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused
by pipeline leaks and ruptures  the location of pipelines near populated areas
including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites
could increase these risks  at december 31 2000 we owned or operated
approximately 2650 miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline
systems throughout the united states  as part of our normal maintenance
program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe
may require repair replacement or additional maintenance  any of these events
could result in loss of human life significant damage to property
environmental pollution impairment of our operations and substantial losses to
us  in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance
against some but not all of these risks and losses  the occurrence of any of
these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position and results of operations

     the sale of our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors
beyond our control the factors include the availability and capacity of
transportation and processing facilities our failure to access these facilities
and obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our
business

item 3  legal proceedings

     we are a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of
our business none of which in managements opinion should result in judgments
which would have a material adverse effect on us

environmental liability

     the epa notified us in february 2000 that we might have potential liability
for waste material disposed of at the casmalia superfund site site located
on a 252acre parcel in santa barbara county california  over 10000 separate
parties disposed of waste at the site while it was operational from 1973 to
1989  the epa stated that federal state and local governmental agencies along
with the numerous private entities that used the site for waste disposal will be
expected to pay the cleanup costs which could total as much as several hundred
million dollars  the epa is also pursuing the ownersoperators of the site to
pay for remediation

     documents received with the notification from the epa indicate that we used
the site principally to dispose of salt water from two wells over a period from
1976 to 1979  there is no allegation that we violated any laws in the disposal
of material at the site  the epas actions stemmed from the fact that the
ownersoperators of the site do not have the financial means to implement a
closure plan for the site  a group of potentially responsible parties
including the company have had extensive settlement discussions with the epa
however the parties have yet to

                                       17
page

reach an agreement

     we have established a reserve that we believe to be adequate to cover this
potential environmental liability based on our estimate of the probable outcome
of this matter  while the potential impact of this claim may materially affect
quarterly or annual financial results management does not believe it would
materially impact our financial position or cash flows  we will continue to
monitor the facts and our assessment of our liability related to this claim

wyoming royalty litigation

     in june 2000 two overriding royalty owners sued us in wyoming state court
the plaintiffs have requested class certification under the wyoming rules of
civil procedure and allege that we have deducted impermissible costs of
production from royalty payments to the plaintiffs and other similarly situated
persons  additionally the suit claims that we have failed to properly inform
the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons of the deductions taken from
royalties

     while we believe that we have substantial defenses to this claim and intend
to vigorously assert such defenses the investigation into this claim has only
just begun and accordingly we can not presently determine the likelihood or
range of any potential loss

     we operate in one segment natural gas and oil exploration and development

overview

     our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of
natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive
terms price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the
last few years from the third quarter of 1998 through the first quarter of
1999 we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices resulting in lower
revenues and net income during this period however in the summer of 1999 and
continuing into early 2000 prices improved for the months of april through
october 2000 we had certain natural gas hedges in place that prevented us from
realizing the full impact of this price environment see the commodity price
swaps and options discussion on page 31 despite this limitation our realized
natural gas price for each month in the year 2000 was higher than the same month
of any previous year in the final months of 2000 the nymex futures market
reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices we benefited from this
market with our realized natural gas price reaching 566 per mcf in december

     we reported earnings of 107 per share or 292 million for 2000 this
is up from the 021 per share or 51 million reported in 1999 the
improvement is a result of the stronger commodity price environment during the
year 2000 with our realized natural gas price up 44 to 319 per mcf and our
crude oil price up 56 to 2681 per bbl

     a discussion of our results from recurring operations can be found in the
results of operations section beginning on page 26 before taking into account
selected nonrecurring items net income for 2000 was 302 million or 110
per share and 04 million or 002 per share for 1999

     we drilled 129 gross wells with a success rate of 86 in 2000 compared to
73 gross wells and an 84 success rate in 1999  total capital expenditures were
1226 million for 2000 compared to 881 million in 1999  most of the 345
million increase was spent on drilling with the largest activity increase
coming in the gulf coast region where we continued to develop the etouffee bon
ton augen and krescent prospects in south louisiana  we increased our spending
for seismic data both 2d and 3d in order to evaluate our drilling
opportunities for 2000 and beyond  additionally a portion of our capital
budget in 2000 was spent to construct production facilities for use with several
wells in south louisiana

     total equivalent production for 2000 was 669 bcfe a decrease of 6 over
1999  production delays on nonoperated properties in the gulf coast region
combined with the sale of nonstrategic properties in appalachia in the fourth
quarter of 1999 accounted for much of this decline  by the fourth quarter this
gulf coast production was online and we exited the year producing approximately
197 mmcfe per day  due to the increased demand for drilling rigs and crews
some short drilling delays are anticipated in early 2001  however whenever
possible we have contracted rigs and crews to begin working on our 2001
drilling program

     during 2000 we improved our debttoequity ratio from 611 at the end of
1999 to 526 at the close of 2000 this improvement was a result of several
significant accomplishments we sold 34 million shares of common stock in may
2000 for net proceeds of 715 million of which 516 million was used to
repurchase all of our preferred stock the remaining proceeds along with
another 148 million from employee stock option exercises were used to reduce
debt and pay dividends from year end 1999 to year end 2000 we reduced debt by
24 million

     we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit
concentrating on the highest expected return opportunities and from synergistic
acquisitions we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current
industry environment enabling us to add shareholder value over the longterm

financial condition

capital resources and liquidity

     our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas
properties and assetbased borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves  our
level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors including the price of
oil and natural gas and our ability to control and reduce costs  demand for
natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized
by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however in the
summer of 2000 our realized gas prices began to climb and by the fourth quarter
of 2000 we were realizing the highest prices in the companys history

     the primary sources of cash for us during 2000 were funds generated from
operations and proceeds from the sale of stock  funds were used primarily for
exploration and development expenditures the repurchase of the preferred stock
dividend payments and the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility

     we had net cash inflows of 59 million during 2000 the net cash inflow
from operating activities of 1190 million substantially offsets the 1192
million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures the cash proceeds
from sale of common stock of 851 million effectively funded the repurchase of
the preferred stock debt reduction and dividend payments

     cash flows provided by operating activities in 2000 were 265 million
higher than in 1999  this improvement was primarily a result of increased
revenues from higher realized commodity prices

     cash flows provided by operating activities in 1999 were 53 million
higher than in 1998  this improvement was a result of increased revenues from
higher realized commodity prices and the proceeds from the buyout of the long
term gas sales contract  partially offsetting this benefit was the less
favorable change in the balance sheet as we reduced the balance in accounts
payable between year ends

     cash flows provided by financing activities in 2000 included 851 million
in proceeds received from the sale of common stock both in a block trade and
through the exercise of employee stock options  of the proceeds 516 million
was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock
additional cash used in financing activities included 24 million used to reduce
the yearend debt balance to 269 million from 293 million in 1999 and cash
used to pay dividends to stockholders

     cash flows used by financing activities in 1999 included 50 million used
to reduce the yearend debt balance to 293 million from 343 million in 1998
and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders

     cash flows provided by financing activities in 1998 were increases in
borrowings on the revolving credit facility used to fund investing activities
such as the 1998 drilling program and the 836 million in property
acquisitions  financing activities in 1998 also included the payment of
dividends and the purchase of shares in the open market under our share
repurchase program  the purchased shares are held as treasury shares

     we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks the revolving
term of which runs to december 2003  the available credit line under this
facility currently 250 million is subject to adjustment on the basis of the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets
accordingly oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation
while the current price environment is quite strong management can not predict
how future price levels may change the banks longterm price outlook  to
reduce the impact of any redetermination we strive to manage our debt at a
level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing
capacity  at year end this excess capacity totaled 113 million or 45 of the
total available credit line  management believes it has the ability to finance
if necessary our capital requirements including acquisitions  oil and gas
prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant
compliance  please read note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility

     in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the
outstanding level of borrowings we have a period of 180 days to reduce our
outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line  the revolving credit agreement
also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the
adjusted credit line within the first 90 days of any adjustment

     our interest expense for 2001 is projected to be 173 million  in may
2001 a 160 million principal payment is due on our 1018 notes  the amount
is reflected as current portion of longterm debt on our balance sheet  the
payment is expected to be made with cash from operations and if necessary from
increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility

     during 2000 dividends were paid on our common stock totaling 44 million
and on our 6 convertible redeemable preferred stock totaling 22 million  we
have paid quarterly common stock dividends of 004 per share since becoming
publicly traded in 1990  the amount of future dividends is determined by our
board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors including future
earnings financial condition and capital requirements

     in may 2000 we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the
holder for 516 million  since this stock had been recorded at a stated value
of 567 million on our balance sheet we realized a negative dividend to
preferred stockholders of 51 million  we received net proceeds of 715
million from the sale of 34 million shares of common stock in a public offering
primarily to fund this transaction  after repurchasing the preferred stock the
excess proceeds were used to reduce debt

capital and exploration expenditures

     on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration
activities excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions with cash
generated from operations  we budget these capital expenditures based on our
projected cash flows for the year

     the following table presents major components of our capital and
exploration expenditures for the three years ended december 31 2000

          1  includes 701 million in oil and gas properties acquired from
                 oryx energy company in december 1998

     total capital and exploration expenditures for 2000 increased 345 million
compared to 1999 primarily as a result of the increased drilling program in
2000  the 2000 drilling program included an over 100 increase in net wells
drilled and a 35 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses
including costs of obtaining seismic data  during the last half of 1999 we
acquired 174 million of oil and gas properties in the moxa arch in the rocky
mountains area including 27 gross wells approximately 16 bcfe of proved
reserves and approximately 43000 net undeveloped acres that complement our
existing moxa arch development

     we plan to drill 240 gross wells in 2001 compared with 129 gross wells
drilled in 2000  this 2001 drilling program includes 1671 million in total
capital and exploration expenditures up from 1226 million in 2000 and is our
largest capital program to date  expected spending in 2001 includes 930
million for drilling and facilities and 486 million in exploration expenses
in addition to the drilling and exploration program other 2001 capital
expenditures are planned primarily for lease acquisitions and for gathering and
pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction  we will continue to
assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the
capital and exploration expenditures accordingly

other issues and contingencies

     corporate income tax  we generate tax credits for the production of
certain qualified fuels including natural gas produced from tight sands
formations and devonian shale  the credit for natural gas from a tight sand
formation tight gas sands amounts to 052 per mmbtu for natural gas sold
prior to 2003 from qualified wells drilled in 1991 and 1992  a number of wells
drilled in the appalachian region during 1991 and 1992 qualified for the tight
gas sands tax credit  the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale
is estimated to be 106 per

                                       23
page

mmbtu in 2000 in 1995 and 1996 we completed three transactions to monetize the
value of these tax credits resulting in revenues of 22 million in 2000 and
approximately 41 million over the remaining two years see note 13 of the
notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

     we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the
alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national
energy policy act of 1992 the act  the act repealed provisions of the amt
requiring a taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on
account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion
deductions  the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years
beginning after 1992  the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a
taxpayers alternative minimum taxable income by more than 40 of the amount of
such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference

     regulations  our operations are subject to various types of regulation by
federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas
production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other
business matters section of item 1 business for a discussion of these
regulations

     restrictive covenants  our ability to incur debt to pay dividends and to
make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in
the companys various debt instruments  among other requirements our revolving
credit agreement and 719 notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of
operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to
10  at december 31 2000 the calculated ratio for 2000 was 63 to 10  in
the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants the company
may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank which if granted would allow
us a period of time to remedy the situation  see further discussion in capital
resources and liquidity and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion

conclusion

     our financial results depend upon many factors particularly the price of
natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive
terms  the average produced natural gas sales price received in 2000 was 44
higher than in 1999  however 1999 prices were up only 3 over 1998 after
declining 15 from 1997 to 1998  the volatility of natural gas prices in recent
years remains prevalent in 2001 with wide price swings in daytoday trading on
the nymex futures market  given this continued price volatility we can not
predict with certainty what pricing levels will be in the future  because
future cash flows are subject to these variables there is no assurance that our
operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital
expenditures

     while our 2001 plan now includes 1671 million in capital and exploration
spending we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our 2001
spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements
including if necessary reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or
common stock dividends

     we believe our capital resources supplemented with external financing if
necessary are adequate to meet our capital requirements

     these selected items impacted our financial results  because they are not
a part of our normal business we have isolated their effects in the table
above  these selected items for 2000 were as follows

    a 91 million impairment 56 million after tax was recorded on the
     beaurline field in south texas as a result of a casing collapse in two of
     the fields wells
    as a result of repurchasing all of the preferred stock at less than the
     book value we recorded a 51 million negative stock dividend in may 2000
    miscellaneous net revenue primarily from the settlement of a natural gas
     sales contract was recorded in the first quarter 14 million after tax

                                       26
page

    as a result of bankruptcy proceedings of two of our customers we recorded
     21 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter 13 million after
     tax
    we announced the closure of the regional office in pittsburgh in may 2000
     and recorded costs of 10 million 06 million after tax these costs
     were recorded in the income statement categories that will receive the
     future savings benefit 06 million in operations 01 million in
     exploration and 03 million in administration

these selected items for 1999 were as follows

    we had a 15year cogeneration contract under which we sold approximately
     20 of our western region natural gas per year the contract was due to
     expire in 2008 but during 1999 we reached an agreement with the
     counterparty under which the counterparty bought out the remainder of the
     contract for 12 million this transaction completed in december 1999
     accelerated the realization of any future price premium that may have been
     associated with the contract and added 12 million of pretax other revenue
     73 million after tax we simultaneously sold forward a similar quantity
     of western region gas production through april 2001 at similar prices to
     those in the old contract the natural gas sales price stated in this new
     contract was significantly below yearend market prices in the region if
     market prices remain above the fixed contract price beyond april 2001 we
     could expect to realize notably higher natural gas sales prices on this
     production
    in the fourth quarter of 1999 we recorded impairments totaling 7 million
     on two of our producing fields in the gulf coast region 43 million after
     tax the chimney bayou field was impaired by 66 million due to a
     significant reserve revision on the broussardmiddleton 1r well in
     connection with a decline in its natural gas production accompanied by a
     marked increase in water production the broussardmiddleton 1r was the
     only producing well in this field the lawson field was impaired by 04
     million due to an unsuccessful workover on one of its wells
    we recorded a 4 million gain on the sale of certain nonstrategic oil and
     gas assets most notably the clarksburg properties in the appalachian
     region sold to enervest effective october 1999 24 million after tax
    we recorded a 12 million reserve against other revenue for certain wells
     no longer deemed to be eligible for the section 29 tight gas sands credit
     following an industry tax court ruling 07 million after tax late in
     1999 the ferc issued a rule proposal that may ultimately restore the
     eligibility for some or all of the wells in question for an update on the
     fercs actions please read note 13 of the notes to the consolidated
     financial statements

2000 and 1999 compared

     the following discussion is based on our results before taking into account
the selected items discussed above

     net income and revenues  we reported net income in 2000 of 302 million
or 110 per share  during 1999 we reported net income of 04 million or
002 per share  operating income increased 429 million or 135 and
operating revenues increased 831 million or 29 in 2000  the improvement in
operating revenues was mainly a result of the 487 million rise in natural gas
sales due to the increase in gas prices and the 245 million increase in
brokered natural gas sales revenue  operating revenues were reduced by a 10
million loss on natural gas price collar arrangements used during 2000  see
further discussion in item 7a  price and production volume increases in crude
oil also contributed to the higher operating revenues  operating income was
similarly impacted by these revenue changes

     the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose 150 per
mcf or 66 to 379 increasing operating revenues by approximately 212
million  in the western region the average natural gas production sales price
increased 090 per mcf or 46 to 286 increasing operating revenues by
approximately 249 million  the average appalachian natural gas production
sales price increased 071 per mcf or 28 to 324 increasing operating
revenues by approximately 127 million  the overall weighted average natural
gas production sales price increased 097 per mcf or 44 to 319 increasing
revenues by 588 million

     natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was down 14 bcf or
9 to 141 bcf primarily

                                       27
page

due to production difficulties in the beaurline field and delays in bringing new
production online in south louisiana natural gas production volume in the
western region was down 03 bcf to 290 bcf due primarily to lower levels of
drilling activity in the midcontinent area during 1999 and 2000 natural gas
production volume in the appalachian region was down 29 bcf to 178 bcf as a
result of the sale of certain nonstrategic assets in the appalachian region
effective october 1 1999 and a decrease in drilling activity in the region
total natural gas production was down 46 bcf or 7 generating a revenue
decrease of 101 million in 2000

     crude oil prices rose 959 per bbl or 56 to 2681 resulting in an
increase to operating revenues of approximately 92 million  the volume of
crude oil sold in the year increased slightly to 953 mbbls increasing operating
revenues by 04 million

     brokered natural gas revenue increased 245 million or 21 over the
prior year  the sales price of brokered natural gas rose 52 resulting in an
increase in revenue of 485 million  the volume of natural gas brokered this
year declined by 21 reducing revenues by 240 million  after including the
related brokered natural gas costs we realized a net margin of 54 million in
2000

     excluding the selected items regarding the contract settlements in 2000
and the sales contract buyout and the section 29 tax credit provision in 1999
other operating revenues increased 02 million to 55 million

     costs and expenses  total costs and expenses from operations excluding
the selected items related to the impairment of longlived assets in each year
and the costs associated with closing the regional office in pittsburgh during
2000 increased 402 million or 16 from 1999 due primarily to the following

    brokered natural gas cost increased 235 million or 21 primarily due to
     the 465 million impact of higher purchased natural gas prices this was
     partially offset by a 230 million reduction to purchased natural cost
     the result of fewer brokered sales this year compared to the prior year

    production and pipeline expense increased 19 million or 6 primarily as
     a result of costs associated with the expansion of the gulf coast regional
     office both in staffing and office facilities additionally operational
     costs for surface equipment and compressor maintenance were up in the rocky
     mountains area where we drilled 50 more net wells in 2000 compared to
     1999 on a unitsofproduction basis our companywide production and
     pipeline expense was 053 per mcfe in 2000 versus 047 per mcfe in 1999

    exploration expense increased 83 million or 72 primarily as a result
     of the following

       a 35 million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last
        year due to increased drilling activity in all regions
       a 13 million increase in delay rental costs over last year largely due
        to delays in scheduled drilling projects in the gulf coast region
       a 21 million increase for salaries wages and incentive compensation
        largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region to
        support the expanded drilling program
       a 05 million increase in dry hole costs although the drilling success
        rate improved from 84 in 1999 to 86 in 2000 we recorded two
        exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast region versus only
        one in 1999

    depreciation depletion amortization and impairment expense excluding the
     selected item related to the sfas 121 impairment in each year increased
     05 million or 1 over 1999  a 6 decrease in total natural gas
     equivalent production caused the expense to remain just slightly above last
     years level despite the 7 increase in the per unit expense to 086 per
     mcfe

    general and administrative expenses remained at the same level as in 1999

    taxes other than income increased 61 million as a result of higher
     natural gas and oil revenues

     interest expense decreased 29 million primarily due to lower average
levels of borrowing on the revolving credit facility

     income tax expense was up 181 million due to the comparable increase in
earnings before income tax

     no significant asset sale activity occurred in 2000  gain on the sale of
assets was 4 million for 1999

                                       28

these gains are the result of the nonstrategic asset divestitures primarily
the sale of the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region to enervest
effective october 1999

1999 and 1998 compared

     the following discussion is based on our results before taking into account
the selected items discussed above

     net income and revenues  we reported net income in 1999 of 04 million
or 002 per share  during 1998 we reported net income of 19 million or
008 per share  operating income increased 44 million or 16 and operating
revenues increased 319 million or 13 in 1999  the improvement in operating
revenues was mainly a result of the 193 million increase in brokered natural
gas revenue and the 74 million rise in crude oil and condensate sales due to
both price improvements and production volume increases  price and production
volume increases in natural gas also contributed to the higher operating
revenues  operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes
net income was reduced by a 72 million increase in interest expense

     natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up 49 bcf or
46 to 155 bcf primarily due to production from the oryx acquisition recent
discoveries and development in the kacee field in south texas and the
redrilling of certain wells in the beaurline field  natural gas production
volume in the western region was down 16 bcf to 293 bcf due primarily to lower
levels of drilling activity in the midcontinent area during 1998 and 1999
natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down 20 bcf to 207
bcf as a result of the sale of certain nonstrategic assets in the appalachian
region effective october 1 1999 and a decrease in drilling activity in the
region in 1999  total natural gas production was up 13 bcf or 2 yielding a
revenue increase of 27 million in 1999

     the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose 014 per
mcf or 7 to 229 increasing operating revenues by approximately 22
million  in the western region the average natural gas production sales price
increased 006 per mcf or 3 to 196 increasing operating revenues by
approximately 18 million  the average appalachian natural gas production
sales price remained flat to last year at 253 per mcf  the overall weighted
average natural gas production sales price increased 006 per mcf or 3 to
222 increasing revenues by 39 million

     the volume of crude oil sold in the year increased by 279 mbbls or 43 to
929 mbbls increasing operating revenues by 36 million  the volume increase
was largely due to production from the oryx acquisition  crude oil prices rose
416 per bbl or 32 to 1722 resulting in an increase to operating revenues
of approximately 38 million

     brokered natural gas revenue increased 193 million or 20 over the prior
year  the sales price of brokered natural gas rose 5 resulting in an increase
in revenue of 49 million  additionally the volume of natural gas brokered
this year increased by 15 increasing revenues by 144 million  after
including the related brokered natural gas costs we realized a net margin of
44 million in 1999

     excluding the selected items regarding the sales contract buyout and the
section 29 tax credit provision other operating revenues decreased 13 million
to 54 million  the decline was a result of decreases in activity in the
following areas

    transportation revenue declined 06 million
    revenue from our brine treatment plants declined 03 million
    natural gas liquid sales declined 02 million due to lower activity levels
     during 1999
    section 29 revenues decreased slightly due to normal production decline

   costs and expenses  total costs and expenses from operations excluding the
selected item related to the impairment of longlived assets increased 270
million or 12 from 1998 due primarily to the following

    brokered natural gas cost increased 204 million or 22 primarily due to
     15 increase in volume which added 135 million of cost additionally the
     purchase cost of natural gas rose 7 resulting in an increase

                                       29
page

     in brokered natural gas cost of 69 million

    production and pipeline expense increased 31 million or 10 primarily
     as a result of the incremental cost of operating the oryx properties
     acquired in december 1998 on a unitsofproduction basis production and
     pipeline expense was 047 per mcfe in 1999 versus 044 per mcfe in 1998

    exploration expense decreased 81 million or 41 primarily as a result
     of

       a 55 million reduction in dry hole costs from 1998 largely due to a
        smaller drilling program in 1999 that resulted in seven dry holes
        compared to 12 dry holes in 1998

       a 22 million decrease in geological and geophysical costs over last
        year largely due to a decline in seismic acquisition costs in the
        appalachian region

    depreciation depletion amortization and impairment expense excluding the
     select item related to the sfas 121 impairment increased 117 million or
     26 over 1998  this increase was due to costs associated with the oryx
     properties as well as higher finding costs in 1998 on certain fields in
     the gulf coast region that were largely related to mechanical difficulties
     associated with drilling  a 4 increase in total natural gas equivalent
     production including a 59 production increase in the higher finding cost
     gulf coast region is the other major component of the dda increase

    general and administrative expenses decreased 18 million or 8 due to

       lower noncash stock compensation expense for stock awards 12
        million

       lower outside consulting services 06 million

     interest expense increased 72 million primarily due to the debt increase
for the oryx acquisition in december 1998 and to partially fund the 1998
drilling program

     income tax expense was up 17 million due to the comparable increase in
earnings before income tax

     gain on the sale of assets totaled 4 million for 1999 compared to 05
million in 1998  these gains are the result of the nonstrategic asset
divestitures primarily the sale of the clarksburg properties in the appalachian
region to enervest effective october 1999



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

oil and gas prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period of
time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business

     our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow
funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for
natural gas and to a lesser extent oil declines in oil and natural gas prices
may materially adversely affect our financial condition liquidity ability to
obtain financing and operating results lower oil and gas prices also may reduce
the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically historically oil
and gas prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely
and they are likely to continue to be volatile oil and gas prices declined
substantially in 1998 and despite recent improvement could decline again
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas
prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results

     prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response
to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas market
uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control
these factors include

    the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas
    the level of consumer product demand
    weather conditions
    political conditions in oil producing regions including the middle east
    the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting
     countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls
    the price of foreign imports
    actions of governmental authorities

                                       30
page

         domestic and foreign governmental regulations

         the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels

         overall economic conditions


these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices
of oil and gas


     in order to reduce our exposure to shortterm fluctuations in the price of
oil and natural gas we sometimes enter into hedging arrangements our hedging
arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial
price protection against declines in oil and gas prices these hedging
arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us
of increases in prices please read the discussion below related to commodity
price swaps and note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements

commodity price swaps and options

hedges on our production
     from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements
with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our
production  these derivatives are not held for trading purposes  under these
price swaps we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and
crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index
such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures  during 2000 we fixed the price at
an average of 454 per mcf on quantities totaling 315 mmcf representing less
than 1 of the companys 2000 natural gas production  the notional volume of
the crude oil swap transactions was 364 mbbls at a price of 2267 per bbl
which represents approximately 38 of our total oil production for 2000
during 1999 we fixed the price at an average of 288 per mcf on quantities
totaling 3237 mmcf representing 5 of the companys 1999 natural gas
production  the notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was 306
mbbls at a price of 2065 per bbl which represents approximately onethird of
our total oil production for 1999  during 1998 we did not enter into any fixed
price swaps to hedge oil or natural gas production

     as of the years ending december 31 2000 and 1999 we had open natural gas
price swap contracts on our production as follows



                                                                              natural gas price swaps

     financial derivatives related to crude oil reduced revenue by 22 million
during 2000 and by 08 million during 1999 there were no crude oil price swaps
outstanding at december 31 1998

     during 2000 we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a
portion of our natural gas production there were seven collar arrangements
based on separate regional price indexes with a weighted average price floor of
274mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of 338mcf these collars were
in place during the months of april through october 2000 during this period if
the index rose above the ceiling price we paid the counterparty if the
applicable index fell below the floor price the counterparty paid us these
collars covered a total quantity of 9909 mmcf or 16 of our annual production
in april and may 2000 the index prices all fell within the price collar and no
settlements were made in june 2000 all of the indexes rose above the ceiling
prices and remained above the ceiling for the duration of the transaction
resulting in a 10 million reduction to our realized revenue for the year if
these hedges had not been in place our average realized natural gas price for
2000 would have been 017 per mcf higher there were no commodity price collars
in place during 1999

     in december 2000 we believed that the pricing environment provided a
strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our
production through the use of costless collars as of december 31 2000 we had
open natural gas costless price collar arrangements to hedge our 2001 production
as follows



                                                                      natural gas price collars

     the natural gas price hedges noted above include several costless collar
arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our
production  these hedges are in place for the months of february through
october 2001 and cover approximately half of our natural gas production during
this period

hedges on brokered transactions
     we use price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered
transactions typically we enter into contracts to broker natural gas at a
variable price based on the market index price however in some circumstances
some of our customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the
contract after entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of
our customers or suppliers we may use price swaps to effectively convert these
fixed price contracts to marketsensitive price contracts these price swaps are
held by us to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes

     we entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of 1295 mmcf in
2000 3572 mmcf in 1999 and 1971 mmcf in 1998 related to our brokered
activities representing 3 7 and 5 respectively of our total volume of
brokered natural gas sold

     as of the years ending december 31 2000 and 1999 we had open natural gas
price swap contracts on brokered transactions as follows



                                                                       natural gas price swaps

     financial derivatives related to natural gas reduced revenues by less than
01 million in 2000 and increased revenues by 01 million in 1999

     we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts to the extent of
changes in market prices of natural gas and oil  however the market risk
exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss
recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged

     since its issuance we have been modeling the impact of statement of
financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities sfas 133 we had two types of hedges in place as of
january 1 2001 when sfas 133 and sfas 138 became effective the first type is a
cash flow hedge that fixes the price of a certain monthly quantity of natural
gas sold in the gulf coast region through september 2003 based on the current
index price strip the impact of this hedge on january 1 2001 was to record a
hedge loss of 01 million and a charge to other comprehensive income of 42
million correspondingly a hedge liability for 43 million was established

     the second type of hedge is a natural gas price costless collar agreement
we entered into eight of these collars for a portion of our production at
regional indexes for the months of february through october 2001 the collars
have two components of value intrinsic value and time value under sfas 133
both components will be valued at the end of each reporting period intrinsic
value arises when the index price is either above the ceiling or below the floor
for any period covered by the collar if the index is above the ceiling for any
month covered by the collar the intrinsic value would be the difference between
the index and the ceiling prices multiplied by the notional volume similar to
the current accounting treatment intrinsic value related to the current month
would be recorded as a hedge loss if the index is above the ceiling or gain
if the index is below the floor starting in 2001 under sfas 133 any changes
in the intrinsic value component related to future months will be recorded in
other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity on the balance
sheet rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge is
proven to be effective in the case of these natural gas price collars full
effectiveness with respect to the intrinsic value calculation is anticipated as
they are tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold also new
under sfas 133 the time value component a market premiumdiscount is marked
tomarket through the income statement each period since these collar
arrangements were executed on the last business day of 2000 the net premium
value at adoption on january 1 2001 is zero
