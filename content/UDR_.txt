covid19 update 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency with respect to covid19 the pandemic led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace or similar orders while many of such measures have been lifted they may be reinstated or other measures imposed further while vaccines have been developed and are being administered it is unclear when or if vaccines may allow a return to full prepandemic activity levels

while operations have been allowed to fully or partially reopen no assurance can be given that closures or restrictions will not be reinstated or new measures imposed in the future our headquarters all of our properties and our 

corporate offices are located in areas that have been subject to shelterinplace orders and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate or the manner in which they may operate for example restrictions on capacity these orders and restrictions and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to pay their rent it is still uncertain how various legislation or orders adopted by the federal government and state and local governments or those that may be modified or enacted in the future may continue to impact the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to pay their rent the governmental actions intended to prevent the spread of covid19 also caused us to reduce staffing at certain of our locations and have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course further the federal government and a number of the states counties and municipalities in which we operate have adopted and may extend or reinstate eviction moratoriums either directly or indirectly such as through direction to law enforcement or courts not to serve notices or take actions related to eviction or have otherwise modified their eviction processes or requirements which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our ability to enforce our legal and contractual rights and our ability to remove in a timely manner residents or retail and commercial tenants who are not paying their rent and our ability to rent their units or other space to new residents or retail and commercial tenants respectively in addition certain jurisdictions have restricted our ability to charge certain fees including fees for late payment of rent and certain jurisdictions have adopted limits on our ability to increase rents earlier in the pandemic we received more requests from our residents and retail and commercial tenants for assistance with respect to paying rent than we have historically received in response we instituted a number of initiatives to assist residents and other tenants including rent deferrals payment plans and waiving late payment fees when appropriate recently the federal government has allocated funds to rent relief programs run by state and local authorities certain of such programs were slow to begin operating and in certain locations funds are taking longer than expected to be distributed further in certain locations adequate funds may not exist to assist with all unpaid rent additionally certain of our residents with past due rent may not qualify to receive assistance under such programs in addition some of such programs have required and programs in the future may require the forgiveness of a portion of the past due rent or other limitations or restrictions in order to participate or may only provide funds to pay a portion of the past due rent it remains uncertain how such programs will impact our business also vaccine mandates that have been adopted or may be adopted by the federal government or in states and localities in which we operate may impact our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course 

​ 

during the year ended december 31 2021 the company performed an analysis in accordance with the asc 842 leases guidance to assess the collectibility of its operating lease receivables in light of the covid19 pandemic this analysis included an assessment of collectibility of current and future rents and whether those lease payments were no longer probable of collection in accordance with the leases guidance if lease payments are no longer deemed to be probable over the life of the lease contract we recognize revenue only when cash is received and all existing contractual operating lease receivables and straightline lease receivables are reserved 

​ 

as a result of its analysis the company reduced its reserve to approximately 132 million for multifamily tenant lease receivables and increased its reserve to approximately 61 million for retail tenant lease receivables inclusive of 40 million of reserves on straightline lease receivables for its whollyowned communities and communities held by joint ventures in aggregate the reduction in reserve is reflected as a 01 million increase to rental income and a 01 million increase to incomeloss from unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 during the year ended december 31 2020 the company reserved approximately 135 million of multifamily tenant lease receivables and approximately 60 million of retail tenant lease receivables inclusive of 33 million of reserves on straightline lease receivables for its whollyowned communities and communities held by joint ventures in aggregate the reserve is reflected as a 184 million reduction to rental income and a 11 million reduction to incomeloss from unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact to deferred leasing commissions was not material for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

​ 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on its investment in equity securities of a noncore investment the company did not recognize any other adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets or asset impairment charges due to the covid19 pandemic for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

​ 

as of january 31 2022 we had collected 973 967 and 957 of billed monthly rents for our multifamily residents for october november and december respectively january cash rents received are similar when compared to those for october november and december at corresponding times of prior months 

​ 

our strategic vision 

our strategic vision is to be the multifamily public reit of choice we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives which are

 

maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 

we believe greater portfolio diversification as defined by geographic concentration location within a market ie urban or suburban and property quality ie a or b reduces the volatility of our samestore growth throughout the real estate cycle appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio diversified characteristics of our portfolio include

  

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research

acquisitions and dispositions 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider a wide variety of factors including

 

we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include

 

the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

development activities 

our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio how demographic trends economic drivers and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the longterm and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital at december 31 2021 the company was developing five whollyowned communities located in addison texas denver colorado dublin california washington dc and king of prussia pennsylvania totaling 1417 homes none of which have been completed with a budget of 5015 million in which we have an investment of 3886 million the communities are estimated to be completed between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred 403 million in major renovations which included major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings as of december 31 2021 the company was not redeveloping any communities

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement

maintaining a strong balance sheet 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities

consistently driving operational excellence 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal or increasingly a smartdevice application

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction has improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes

competitive conditions

competition for new residents is generally intense across our markets some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include

 

moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottomline performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside

communities

at december 31 2021 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 160 communities with a total of 53229 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio generally enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents

at december 31 2021 the company was developing five whollyowned communities located in addison texas denver colorado dublin california washington dc and king of prussia pennsylvania totaling 1417 homes none of which have been completed with a budget of 5015 million in which we have an investment of 3886 million the communities are estimated to be completed between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023

at december 31 2021 the company was not redeveloping any communities

samestore community comparison

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year

net income attributable to common stockholders was 1458 million as compared to 600 million in the prior year the increase was primarily driven by higher total noi higher gains from dispositions of real estate higher investment income from unconsolidated entities primarily due to unrealized gains from smartrent a portfolio investment of an unconsolidated fund becoming a public company lower interest expense primarily due to lower debt extinguishment costs and lower interest rates partially offset by higher debt balances

for the year ended december 31 2021 our samestore noi increased by 39 million compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 912 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2021 the increase in noi for the 45143 samestore apartment homes or 848 of our portfolio was primarily driven by lower rent concessions lower vacancy lower bad debt expense a decrease in personnel expense and an increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income partially offset by a decrease in rental rates and higher repair and maintenance expense insurance expense and real estate tax expense

revenue growth in 2022 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy inclusive of economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents

tax matters

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes

inflation 

inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs in addition inflation could also impact our general and administrative expenses the interest on our debt if variable or refinanced in a highinflationary environment and our cost of development activities however the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2021

environmental matters

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous 

materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition

insurance

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

since being first reported in december 2019 covid19 has spread globally including to every state in the united states on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency with respect to covid19 the pandemic led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders while operations have been allowed to fully or partially reopen no assurance can be given that similar closures or restrictions will not be reinstated or new restrictions imposed in the future our headquarters and all of our properties and our corporate offices are located in areas that have been subject to shelterinplace orders and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate or the manner in which they may operate and no assurance can be given that such restrictions or other restrictions will not be reinstated in the future 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread could materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways our rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the occupancy levels at our properties and the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to meet their rent obligations to us which have been in certain cases and could continue to be adversely affected by among other things job losses furloughs store closures lower incomes and uncertainty about the future as a result of the covid19 pandemic and related governmental actions in addition numerous state local and federal efforts including eviction moratoriums shelterinplace orders prohibitions on charging certain fees and limitations on collection laws have affected and if such restrictions are not lifted or are reinstated or new restrictions imposed may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce legal or contractual remedies for the failure to pay rent which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our ability to remove residents or retail and commercial tenants who are not paying rent and our ability to rent their units or other space to new residents or retail and commercial tenants respectively although many of these measures have been lifted additional cases of covid19 and new variants thereof have resulted in and may continue to result in governments reinstating these or similar measures early in 2021 the federal government allocated funds to rent relief programs to be run by state and local authorities under certain of such programs funds have not been and may not be distributed in a timely manner in certain locations the funds available may not be sufficient to pay all past due rent and reallocation of such funds may result in markets in which we operate not having access to the funds anticipated further certain of our residents with past due rent may not qualify to participate in such programs in addition some of such programs have required and programs in the future may require the forgiveness of a portion of the past due rent or agreeing to other limitations that may adversely affect our business in order to participate or may only provide funds to pay a portion of the past due rent in addition while certain locations have adopted programs that may reimburse past due rent owed by residents who have left a community such programs have only been adopted in a minority of our markets and most of the programs that have been adopted are not yet distributing funds it is uncertain how the rent relief programs will impact our business state local and federal governments also have increased and may in the future increase property taxes or other taxes or fees or may enact new taxes or fees in order to increase revenue which has in the past increased and may in the future increase our expenses our development and construction projects including those in our developer capital program also could be adversely affected including as a result of disruptions in supply chains or as a result of delayed construction schedules due to social distancing efforts vaccine mandates impacting staffing or occurrences of the virus at a construction site although to date such impacts have not been material the covid19 pandemic or related impacts thereof also could adversely affect the businesses and financial conditions of our counterparties including our joint venture partners participants in the developer capital program and general contractors and their subcontractors and their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and to 

complete transactions or projects with us as intended further state and local governments have instituted or such authorities or the federal government could in the future institute vaccine mandates that apply to our associates in certain jurisdictions which may impact our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course or result in an increased cost to do so in addition a significant number of our retail tenants were and may in the future be forced to close either temporarily or completely or operate on a limited basis as a result of covid19 and related government actions including staffing challenges created thereby which has resulted in and could continue to result in delays in rent payments rent concessions early lease terminations or tenant bankruptcies 

the extent of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and intensity of the pandemic the emergence and characteristics of new variants the timing and effectiveness of covid19 vaccines including against covid19 variant strains the creation and duration of or the reinstatement of government measures to mitigate the pandemic or address its effects including vaccine mandates the timing and effectiveness of government rent relief programs and the timing and effectiveness of vaccine administration all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict due to the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic we are not able at this time to estimate the full effect of these factors on our business but the adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be material

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally including as a result of covid19 may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession debt levels housing markets stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels and rental revenues would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others

 

the geographic concentration of our communities in certain markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely impacted by economic or other conditions for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 566 of our total noi was generated from communities located in metropolitan dc 170 orange county ca 133 boston ma 117 the san francisco bay area ca 76 and seattle wa 70 as a result if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or real estate market conditions such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse for example the urban core markets of new york ny san francisco bay area ca and boston ma have been more adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic in 

comparison to our other markets resulting in larger decreases in rental income from elevated rent concessions and lower occupancy in those markets in addition if one or more of these markets is adversely affected by changes in regional or local regulations including those related to rent control or stabilization such regulations may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operation than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms furthermore because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income or if they experience decreases in their income or job losses we may be unable to increase or maintain rent andor delinquencies may increase

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases generally five to ten years with marketbased or fixedprice renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small andor local businesses may subject us to certain risks including risks related to such tenants being required not to operate or to operate on a limited basis due to the covid19 pandemic the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time particularly in an inflationary environment tenants may provide guarantees and other credit support which may prove to be inadequate or uncollectable and the failure rate of small andor local businesses may be higher than average we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our retail or commercial space terminate either at the end of the lease or because a tenant leaves early the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the prior lease terms or we may incur additional expenses related to modifications of the spaces in order to satisfy new tenants our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain our retail or commercial tenants have in the past and may in the future experience financial distress or bankruptcy or fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

​ 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt general and administrative expenses and other expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold or the purchase price may be reduced to cover any cost of correcting defects or making improvements these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties development or redevelopment or funding the developer capital program we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities among others



 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks among others

 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks among others



 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities borrowers or joint venture partners among others as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors have resulted in and in the future could result in services not being provided as expected projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or contractual obligations to us not being satisfied or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures including those in which we own a preferred interest with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures as of december 31 2021 we had active joint ventures and partnerships including our preferred equity investments with a total equity investment of 7025 million we have in the past and could in the future become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which could adversely impact us moreover our partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might fail to make capital contributions when due or may otherwise not act as expected which may require us to contribute additional capital or may negatively impact the project in addition we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell or other similar arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income

we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures including i a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions which could result in litigation or disposing of an asset at a time at which we otherwise would not sell the asset ii limitations on our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner and iii requirements to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance however subject to certain conditions we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability deductibles and selfinsured retentions customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the cost of insuring our apartment communities and our operations is a component of expense insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties and our operations with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that insure us may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure or exit or partial exit from an insurance market of one or more insurance companies may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts that we seek or at all or increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or cause us to selfinsure a portion of the risk or increase the cost of insuring properties

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if opportunities we believe are appropriate arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others

 

failure to succeed with new initiatives may limit our ability to grow noi  we have in the past developed and may in the future develop initiatives that are intended to drive operating efficiencies and grow noi including smart home technologies and selfservice options that are accessible to residents through smart devices or otherwise such initiatives in the past have involved and in the future may involve our associates having new or different responsibilities and processes we may incur significant costs and divert resources in connection with such initiatives and these initiatives may not perform as projected which could adversely affect our results of operations and the market price of udr’s common stock

​ 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination or we could be required to incur additional costs to change how the property is constructed or operated due to presence of such substances these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance 

with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm or other hazardous substances environmental health and safety laws require that acm and other hazardous substances be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or other hazardous substances or releases of acm or other hazardous substances into the environment

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others for property damage or personal injury

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants claims have been asserted and in the future claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition if claims arise we may expend resources and incur costs in investigating and resolving such claims even if our property was in compliance with the law

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the adoption of or changes to rent control rent stabilization eviction tenants’ rights and similar laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and property values various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control rent stabilization or limitations and similar laws and regulations that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees including laws or court orders either of which could have a retroactive effect for example in june 2019 the state of new york enacted new rent control regulations known as the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019 and in october of 2019 the state of california enacted the tenant protection act of 2019 we have seen a recent increase in governments enacting or considering or being urged to consider such laws and regulations federal state and local governments or courts also have made and may make in the future changes to laws related to allowable fees and rents 

eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations including changes in response to covid19 and other changes that apply retroactively that could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our properties laws and regulations regarding rent control rent stabilization eviction tenants’ rights and similar matters as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such laws and regulations may limit our ability to charge market rents limit our ability to increase rents evict delinquent tenants or change fees or recover increases in our operating expenses which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our properties

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events our communities are located in areas that have or in the future may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes floods snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

risk of potential climate change  to the extent significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located occur we may experience extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation and temperature or water levels all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or communities that are otherwise affected by these changes should the impact of such climate changes be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in areas subject to earthquakes including in the general vicinity of earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical

risk of accidental death or injury due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters other hazards or acts or omissions of third parties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence destruction or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks or other similar actions that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack or similar events in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future 

attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we have in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or subordinated loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our investment in addition mezzanine loans typically have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal

risk related to preferred equity investments we have made in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of directly or indirectly acquiring developing or managing real property generally we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors managers general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests further if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property operate the entity refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all in addition we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent we may lose our entire investment in the entity

risks related to ground leases we have in the past and may in the future enter into as either landlord or tenant a longterm ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors for example fair market rent that are not objective and are not within our control we may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted in the past we have had disagreements with respect to revised rental rates and certain of such disagreements have gone to arbitration for resolution as provided in the applicable lease agreement and have been resolved in a manner adverse to us in addition the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our 

internal control over financial reporting if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations in addition if we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr’s common stock

a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation we rely on information technology systems including the internet and networks and systems and software developed maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes third party vendors may collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants prospective tenants and employees we also maintain financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems while we take steps and generally require third party vendors to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors’ information technology systems including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information it is possible that our or our third party vendors’ security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems’ or software’s improper functioning or the loss misappropriation disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information including information about our tenants and employees cybersecurity breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses malware phishing scams attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or misconduct and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach or other occurrence or that such insurance will continue to be available at rates that we consider reasonable or at all we have in the past experienced cybersecurity breaches on our information technology systems or relating to software that we utilize and while none to date have been material we expect such breaches may occur in the future as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches or implement appropriate preventative measures any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function security and availability of our or our third party vendors’ and other third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents or other tenants and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures despite system redundancy and the existence of disaster recovery plans for our information technology systems our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors’ control including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems software and technology these systems software and technologies must be refined updated and replaced on a regular basis in order for us to meet our business requirements and our residents’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost or fail to do so our business could suffer also we may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system software or technology and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could adversely affect our results of operation 

social media presents risks the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation further employees or others may disclose nonpublic information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites which could adversely affect our business and results of operations as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements

thirdparty expectations relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks  there is an increasing focus from certain investors tenants employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance factors in addition there is an increased focus on such matters by various regulatory authorities some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and in some cases may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards in addition the criteria by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are assessed and the regulations applicable thereto are evolving which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives or activities to satisfy such new criteria or regulations further if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific thirdparty provider some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies furthermore if our competitors’ corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours potential or current investors may elect to invest in our competitors instead in addition in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental social and governance matters we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors tenants and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected

risks related to our indebtedness and financings

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest could restrict or limit our ability to incur additional debt or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required debt payments and satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders

failure to generate sufficient income could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay dividends or distributions will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the income generated by our apartment communities

 

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt including unsecured commercial paper at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2021 udr had approximately 3115 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 58 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt including unsecured commercial paper accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties

the phaseout of libor and transition to an alternative benchmark interest rate could have adverse effects the administrator of libor ceased the publication of the one week and two month libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 and intends to cease the publication of the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30 2023 the alternative reference rate committee has identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the preferred alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york it is expected that new contracts will not reference libor and will instead use sofr or other alternative reference rates due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate all financial market participants including us are impacted by the risks associated with this transition and therefore it could adversely affect our operations and cash flows

our debt level may be increased our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit construction loans and other forms of secured debt commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets for 

example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated “high volatility commercial real estate” designation which has adversely impacted the availability of loans including construction loans and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of udr’s existing stockholders could be diluted

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets moody’s and standard  poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt commercial paper program and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets including our ability to access the commercial paper market

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control the global equity and credit markets have experienced in the past and may experience in the future periods of extraordinary turmoil and volatility these circumstances may materially and adversely impact liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive or in some cases unavailable disruptions and uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility and other credit facilities if these institutions become capital constrained tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock

a change in us government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the us have been and may in the future be suggested that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide limitations on the loans that the agencies may make which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect our business and results of operations

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our results of operations

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit 

our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs

risks related to tax laws

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including for periods prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our regular dividends ie dividends other than capital gain dividends paid to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates however individual us stockholders generally may deduct 20 of such regular dividends under section 199a of the code reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends although such provision will expire after 2025 absent future legislation

udr conducts a portion of its business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established and conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to 

udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us federal income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate and reits including the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 federal legislation intended to ameliorate the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” has been enacted that makes technical corrections to or modifies on a temporary basis certain of the provisions of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 and it is possible that additional such legislation may be enacted in the future the full impact of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 and the cares act may not become evident for some period of time in addition there can be no assurance that future changes to the us federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results the reit rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes if enacted certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

we cannot predict whether when or to what extent any new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares

we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business we or our affiliates including entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to federal state or local tax audits if we or such entities become subject to federal state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as 

readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired in addition even if the 90 test were met if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were a publicly traded partnership there could be adverse tax impacts for certain limited partners

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations including as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a result the market price of udr’s common stock has been and in the future could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including



 

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

business overview

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr inc consolidated financial statements included in this report

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were 210 million 190 million and 135 million respectively

investment in unconsolidated entities

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements

impairment of longlived assets

quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant we will assess our real estate properties for indicators 

of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on certain factors such factors include among other things operational performance market conditions the company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties 

​ 

if a real estate property has indicators of impairment we assess whether the longlived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows which is representative of projected net operating income “noi” plus the residual value of the community our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods if such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

for longlived assets to be disposed of impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost net of accumulated depreciation or fair value less the cost to sell determined on an assetbyasset basis expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred expenditures for improvements renovations and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition

real estate investment properties

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period

reit status

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2021 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit

credit facilities and commercial paper program

in september 2021 the company entered into the credit agreement that provides for a 13 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a 3500 million unsecured term loan the credit agreement allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 25 billion subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2026 with two sixmonth extension options subject to certain conditions the term loan has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2027 the credit agreement also lowered the margin range for the revolving credit facility and the term loan 

the credit agreement amended and restated the company’s prior credit agreement which provided for i a 11 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in january 2023 and ii a 3500 million term loan scheduled to mature in september 2023 the prior credit agreement allowed the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion subject to certain conditions

​ 

based on the company’s current credit rating the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 775 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points and the term loan has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 85 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 70 to 140 basis points the facility fee ranges from 10 to 30 basis points and the margin under the term loan ranges from 75 to 160 basis points

as of december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility leaving 13 billion of unused capacity excluding 28 million of letters of credit at december 31 2021 and 3500 million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan

we have a working capital credit facility which provides for a 75 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “working capital credit facility” with a previously scheduled maturity date of january 14 2022 in september 2021 the company amended the working capital credit facility to extend the maturity date from january 14 2022 to january 12 2024 and lower the margin range for the interest rate based on the company’s current credit rating the working capital credit facility now has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 775 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin ranges from 70 to 140 basis points 

as of december 31 2021 we had 295 million of outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility leaving 455 million of unused capacity

the bank revolving credit facilities and the term loan are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we were in compliance with at december 31 2021

we have an unsecured commercial paper program under the terms of the program we may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of 700 million in july 2021 the maximum aggregate amount was increased from 5000 million to 7000 million the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured indebtedness the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership as of december 31 2021 we had issued 2200 million of commercial paper for one month terms at a weighted average annualized rate of 034 leaving 4800 million of unused capacity in january 2022 the entire 2200 million of outstanding unsecured commercial paper as of december 31 2021 was repaid at maturity with additional proceeds of unsecured commercial paper with maturity dates in january 2022 and february 2022 and proceeds under the working capital credit facility

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets and operations interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 3115 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2021 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 50 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost this analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments

a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows  dollars in thousands

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders 

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders was 1458 million 048 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 600 million 020 per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year the increase resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

 



 

apartment community operations

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 30 of property revenue and land rent property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations inclusive of corporate management regional supervision accounting and other costs

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc below

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 ​ 

the following table is our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to udr inc to total property noi for each of the periods presented  dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

samestore communities

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2020 and held on december 31 2021 consisted of 45143 apartment homes and provided 912 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2021

noi for our samestore community properties increased 05 or 39 million for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 15 or 165 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 37 or 126 million increase in operating expenses  the increase in property rental income was primarily driven by an increase of 111 million from lower vacancy a 47 or 57 million increase in reimbursement and ancillary and fee income a decrease in bad debt expense of 56 million and a decrease of 51 million in rent concessions partially offset by a 11 or 115 million decrease in rental rates physical occupancy increased by 10 to 971 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 04 to 2182

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 172 or 93 million increase in repair and maintenance expense due to the increased use of third party vendors a 294 or 44 million increase in insurance expense due to increased claims and a 28 or 41 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations partially offset by a 127 or 77 million decrease in personnel expense as a result of fewer employees

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 689 and 696 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2019 respectively

nonmature communitiesother

udr’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties

the remaining 88 or 766 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2021 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother increased by 142 or 95 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to a 383 million increase in noi from stabilized nonmature communities primarily due to communities acquired in 2021 and 2020 and a 42 million increase in acquired communities partially offset by a 226 million 

decrease in nonresidentialother primarily due to changes in straightline rent as a result of increased tenant rent concessions during 2020 and a 100 million decrease in sold and held for disposition communities

gainloss on sale of real estate owned

during the year ended december 31 2021 the company recognized gains of 1361 million from the sale of two operating communities located in anaheim california  

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized gains of 1193 million from the sale of three operating communities located in kirkland washington bellevue washington and alexandria virginia

incomeloss from unconsolidated entities

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 656 million and 188 million respectively the increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to 508 million of investment income from retv i which was primarily attributable to unrealized gains from smartrent a portfolio investment held by the fund becoming a public company during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 51 million during the year ended december 31 2020 a further discussion can be found in note 5 joint ventures and partnerships  to the notes to the udr inc consolidated financial statements included in this report

interest expense 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the company recognized interest expense of 1863 million and 2027 million respectively the decrease in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to 423 million of debt extinguishment costs from the prepayment of debt during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 492 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and lower interest rates partially offset by higher debt balances

inflation 

inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and repair and maintenance costs in addition inflation could also impact our general and administrative expenses the interest on our debt if variable or refinanced in a highinflationary environment and our cost of development activities however the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2021

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations

funds from operations

funds from operations “ffo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests and the company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 and restated in november 2018 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo if 

op units downreit units unvested restricted stock unvested ltip units stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count

management considers ffo a useful metric for investors as the company uses ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of the company’s activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs

funds from operations as adjusted

ffo as adjusted “ffoa” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo excluding the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to acquisitionrelated costs prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement impairment writedowns or gains and losses on sales of real estate or other assets incidental to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal and other costs 

management believes that ffoa is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and enables investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits ffoa is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffoa however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffoa or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffoa may not always be comparable to ffoa or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffoa should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity

adjusted funds from operations

adjusted ffo “affo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffoa less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffoa

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo enables investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net incomeloss determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

covid19 update 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency with respect to covid19 the pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace or similar orders while vaccines have been developed and are being administered it is unclear when or if the vaccine may allow a return to prepandemic activity levels

while operations in certain areas have been allowed to fully or partially reopen many areas are experiencing new closures or restrictions subsequent to reopening and no assurance can be given that such closures or restrictions will not continue to occur our headquarters all of our properties and our corporate offices are located in areas that are or have been subject to shelterinplace orders and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate these orders and restrictions and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to pay their rent it is still uncertain how various legislation or orders adopted by the federal government and state and local governments or those that may be modified or enacted in the future may continue to impact the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to pay their rent the governmental actions intended to prevent the spread of covid19 have also caused us to reduce staffing at certain of our locations and have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course further the federal government and a number of the states counties and municipalities in which we operate have adopted and may extend eviction moratoriums either directly or indirectly such as through direction to law enforcement or courts not to serve notices or take actions related to eviction which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our ability to enforce our legal and contractual rights and our ability to remove residents or retail and commercial tenants who are not paying their rent and our ability to rent their units or other space to new residents or retail and commercial tenants respectively in addition certain jurisdictions have restricted our ability to charge certain fees including fees for late payment of rent we have received and continue to receive more 

requests from our residents and retail and commercial tenants for assistance with respect to paying rent than we have historically received in response we have instituted a number of initiatives to assist residents and other tenants including rent deferrals payment plans and waiving late payment fees when appropriate in addition we have seen an increase in tenant rent concessions compared to prior year periods as discussed further below in particular the urban core markets of new york ny san francisco bay area ca and boston ma have been more adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic in comparison to our other markets resulting in larger decreases in rental income from elevated rent concessions and lower occupancy in those markets we also have experienced an increase in resident moveouts and turnover on an annualized basis with respect to leasing activities leasing traffic and visits by potential residents had decreased during much of the year however they increased during the quarter ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same quarter in 2019 our percentage of leases entered into with a prospective tenant has increased year over year 

​ 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company performed an analysis in accordance with the asc 842 leases guidance to assess the collectibility of its operating lease receivables in light of the covid19 pandemic this analysis included an assessment of collectibility of current and future rents and whether those lease payments were no longer probable of collection in accordance with the leases guidance if lease payments are no longer deemed to be probable over the life of the lease contract we recognize revenue only when cash is received and all existing contractual operating lease receivables and straightline lease receivables are reserved 

​ 

as a result of its analysis the company reserved approximately 135 million of multifamily tenant lease receivables and approximately 60 million of retail tenant lease receivables inclusive of 33 million of reserves on straightline lease receivables for its whollyowned communities and communities held by joint ventures in aggregate the reserve is reflected as an 184 million reduction to rental income and a 11 million reduction to incomeloss from unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact to deferred leasing commissions was not material for the year ended december 31 2020 

​ 

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recorded an impairment charge of 31 million on its investment in equity securities of a noncore investment the company did not recognize any other adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets or asset impairment charges due to the covid19 pandemic for the year ended december 31 2020 

as of january 31 2021 we had collected 970 961 and 952 of billed monthly rents for our multifamily residents for october november and december respectively while our cash rent collections in november december and january showed marginal declines versus october this slight seasonal deterioration is consistent with historical collection trends in prior years 

​ 

the operating partnership reserved approximately 55 million of multifamily tenant lease receivables and approximately 35 million of retail tenant lease receivables inclusive of 22 million of reserves on straightline lease receivables for its whollyowned communities in aggregate the reserve is reflected as a 90 million reduction to rental income on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact to deferred leasing commissions was not material for the year ended december 31 2020 

​ 

the operating partnership did not recognize any other adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets or asset impairment charges due to the covid19 pandemic for the year ended december 31 2020 

​ 

our strategic vision 

our strategic vision is to be the multifamily public reit of choice we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives which are

 

maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 

we believe greater portfolio diversification as defined by geographic concentration location within a market ie urban or suburban and property quality ie a or b reduces the volatility of our samestore growth throughout the real estate cycle appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio diversified characteristics of our portfolio include

  

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research

acquisitions and dispositions 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider a wide variety of factors including

 

we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include



 

the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

the following table summarizes the operating partnership’s apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

development activities 

our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio how demographic trends economic drivers and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the longterm and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital at december 31 2020 the company was developing five whollyowned communities located in addison texas denver colorado dublin california washington dc and king of prussia pennsylvania totaling 1378 homes 202 of which have been completed with a budget of 4915 million in which we have an investment of 2479 million the communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2023 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 483 million in major renovations which included major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings as of december 31 2020 the company was not redeveloping any communities

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement

maintaining a strong balance sheet 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities

consistently driving operational excellence 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal or increasingly a smartdevice application

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction has improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic vision is the same as that of the company described above

competitive conditions

competition for new residents is generally intense across our markets some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include

 

moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottomline performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside

communities

at december 31 2020 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 149 communities with a total of 48283 completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 53 communities with a total of 17174 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio generally enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents

at december 31 2020 the company was developing five whollyowned communities located in addison texas denver colorado dublin california washington dc and king of prussia pennsylvania totaling 1378 homes 202 of which have been completed with a budget of 4915 million in which we have an investment of 2479 million the communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2023

at december 31 2020 the company was not redeveloping any communities

samestore community comparison

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year

net income attributable to common stockholders was 600 million as compared to 1809 million in the prior year the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense and interest expense in 2020 and a decrease in gains on the sale of unconsolidated real estate in 2020 partially offset by higher total noi in 2020 and higher gains on the sale of real estate in 2020

for the year ended december 31 2020 our samestore noi decreased by 402 million compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 755 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in noi for the 37607 samestore apartment homes or 779 of our portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in our reserve on multifamily tenant lease receivables higher rent concessions economic occupancy loss higher repair and maintenance expense and real estate taxes partially offset by an increase in rental rates an increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income and a decrease in personnel expense

for the year ended december 31 2020 the operating partnership’s samestore noi decreased by 177 million compared to the prior year the operating partnership’s samestore community properties provided 931 of its total noi for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease in noi for the 15607 samestore apartment homes or 909 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in our reserve on multifamily tenant lease receivables higher rent concessions economic occupancy loss higher repair and maintenance expense and real estate taxes partially offset by an increase in rental rates an increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income and a decrease in personnel expense

revenue growth in 2021 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy inclusive of economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents

tax matters

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level

inflation

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020

environmental matters

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition

insurance

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

risk factors

tableend there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations

the ongoing covid19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

since being first reported in december 2019 covid19 has spread globally including to every state in the united states on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency with respect to covid19 the pandemic has led governments and other authorities around the world including federal state and local authorities in the united states to impose measures intended to control its spread including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans border closings business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders while operations in certain areas have been allowed to fully or partially reopen many areas are experiencing new closures or restrictions subsequent to reopening and no assurance can be given that such closures or restrictions will not continue to occur our headquarters and all of our properties and our corporate offices are located in areas that are or have been subject to shelterinplace orders and restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread could materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways our rental revenue and operating results depend significantly on the occupancy levels at our properties and the ability of our residents and retail and commercial tenants to meet their rent obligations to us which have been in certain cases and could continue to be adversely affected by among other things job losses furloughs store closures lower incomes and uncertainty about the future as a result of the covid19 pandemic the deterioration of economic conditions as a result of the pandemic in certain locations have materially decreased and in other locations may ultimately materially decrease occupancy levels and rents in our portfolio which could adversely affect the value of our properties in addition numerous state local federal and industryinitiated efforts including eviction moratoriums shelterinplace orders prohibitions on charging certain fees and limitations on collection laws have affected and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce legal or contractual remedies for the failure to pay rent which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our ability to remove residents or retail and commercial tenants who are not paying rent and our ability to rent their units or other space to new residents or retail and commercial tenants respectively even if these measures are lifted additional cases of covid19 have resulted in and may continue to result in governments reinstating these or similar measures state local and federal governments also have increased and may in the future increase property taxes or other taxes or fees or may enact new taxes or fees in order to increase revenue which has in the past increased and may in the future increase our expenses our development and construction projects including those in our developer capital program also could be adversely affected including as a result of disruptions in supply chains and government restrictions on the types of projects that may continue during the pandemic or as a result of delayed construction schedules due to social distancing efforts or occurrences of the virus at a construction site the covid19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread also could adversely affect the businesses and financial condition of our counterparties including our joint venture partners participants in the developer capital program and general contractors and their subcontractors and their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and to complete transactions or projects with us as intended in addition a significant number of our retail tenants were or have been forced to close either temporarily or completely or operate on a limited basis as a result of covid19 and related government actions which has resulted in and could continue to result in delays in rent payments rent concessions early lease terminations or tenant bankruptcies 

the covid19 pandemic also has caused and may continue to cause severe economic market and other disruptions worldwide disruptions in the financial markets could adversely impact our access to equity and debt financing including through our commercial paper program on favorable terms or at all which could adversely affect our ability to consummate acquisitions fund developments and capital expenditures and repay or refinance indebtedness 

as it becomes due see “risks related to our indebtedness and financings—disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr’s stock” 

the extent of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and intensity of the pandemic the timing and effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the duration of or the reinstatement of government measures to mitigate the pandemic or address its effects all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict due to the speed with which the situation is developing we are not able at this time to estimate the full effect of these factors on our business but the adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be material

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally including as a result of covid19 may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession debt levels housing markets stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels and rental revenues would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others

 

the geographic concentration of our communities in certain markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely impacted by economic or other conditions for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 587 of our total noi was generated from communities located in metropolitan dc 163 orange county ca 131 the san francisco bay area ca 101 boston ma 116 and new york ny 76 as a result if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or real estate market conditions such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse for example the urban core markets of new york ny san francisco bay area ca and boston ma have been more adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic in comparison to our other markets resulting in larger decreases in rental income from elevated rent concessions and lower occupancy in those markets in addition if one or more of these markets is adversely affected by changes in regional or local regulations including those related to rent control or stabilization such regulations may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operation than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms furthermore because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income or if they experience decreases in their income or job losses we may be unable to increase or maintain rent andor delinquencies may increase

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases generally five to ten years with marketbased or fixedprice renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small andor local businesses may subject us to certain risks including risks related to such tenants being required not to operate or to operate on a limited basis due to the covid19 pandemic the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time tenants may provide guarantees and other credit support which may prove to be inadequate or uncollectable and the failure rate of small andor local businesses may be higher than average we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our retail or commercial space terminate either at the end of the lease or because a tenant leaves early the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the prior lease terms or we may incur additional expenses related to modifications of the spaces in order to satisfy new tenants our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they have in the past and may in the future fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt general and administrative expenses and other expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold or the purchase price may be reduced to cover any cost of correcting defects or making improvements these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties development or redevelopment or funding the developer capital program we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities among others

 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes 

competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks among others

 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks among others



 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities borrowers or joint venture partners among others as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or contractual obligations to us not being satisfied or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures including those in which we own a preferred interest with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures as of december 31 2020 we had active joint ventures and partnerships including our preferred equity investments with a total equity investment of 6002 million we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which could adversely impact us moreover our partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might fail to make capital contributions when due which may require us to contribute additional capital or may negatively impact the project in addition we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell or other similar arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income

we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures including i a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions which could result in litigation or disposing of an asset at a time at which we otherwise would not sell the asset ii limitations on our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner and iii requirements to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance however subject to certain conditions we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability deductibles and selfinsured retentions customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the cost of insuring our apartment communities and our operations is a component of expense insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties and our operations with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that insure us may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure or exit or partial exit from an insurance market of one or more insurance companies may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts that we seek or at all or increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or cause us to selfinsure a portion of the risk or increase the cost of insuring properties

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others

 

failure to succeed with new initiatives may limit our ability to grow samestore noi  we have in the past developed and may in the future develop initiatives that are intended to drive operating efficiencies and grow samestore noi including smart home technologies and selfservice options that are accessible to residents through smart devices such initiatives may also involve our associates having new or different responsibilities and processes we may incur significant costs and divert resources in connection with such initiatives and these initiatives may not perform as projected which could adversely affect our results of operations and the market price of udr’s common stock

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants claims have been asserted and in the future claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition if claims arise we may expend resources and incur costs in investigating and resolving such claims even if our property was in compliance with the law

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the adoption of or changes to rent control rent stabilization eviction tenants’ rights and similar laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and property values various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control rent stabilization or limitations and similar laws and regulations that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees including laws or court orders either of which could have a retroactive effect for example in june 2019 the state of new york enacted new rent control regulations known as the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019 and in october of 2019 the state of california enacted the tenant protection act of 2019 we have seen a recent increase in governments enacting or considering or being urged to consider such laws and regulations federal state and local governments or courts also have made and may make in the future changes to laws related to allowable fees eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations including changes in response to covid19 and other changes that apply retroactively that could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our properties laws and regulations regarding rent control rent stabilization eviction tenants’ rights and similar matters as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such laws and regulations may limit our ability to charge market rents limit our ability to increase rents evict delinquent tenants or change fees or recover increases in our operating expenses which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our properties

laws regulations rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii laws and regulations regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 or iii employment related laws may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change may result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and also may require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes floods snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

risk of potential climate change  to the extent significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located occur we may experience extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or communities that are otherwise affected by these changes should the impact of such climate changes be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in areas subject to earthquakes including in the general vicinity of earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical

risk of accidental death or injury due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence destruction or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks or other similar actions that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack or similar events in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we have in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or subordinated loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the 

property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our investment in addition mezzanine loans typically have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal

risk related to preferred equity investments we have made in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property generally we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors managers general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests further if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property or refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all in addition we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent we may lose our entire investment in the entity

risks related to ground leases we have in the past and may in the future enter into as either landlord or tenant a longterm ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors for example fair market rent that are not objective and are not within our control we may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted in the past we have had disagreements with respect to revised rental rates and certain of such disagreements have gone to arbitration for resolution as provided in the applicable lease agreement and have been resolved in a manner adverse to us in addition the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations in addition if we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr’s common stock

a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation we rely on information technology systems 

including the internet and networks and systems and software developed maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes third party vendors may collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants prospective tenants and employees we also maintain financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems while we take steps and generally require third party vendors to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors’ information technology systems including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information it is possible that our or our third party vendors’ security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems’ or software’s improper functioning or the loss misappropriation disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information including information about our tenants and employees cybersecurity breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses malware phishing scams attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or misconduct and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach we have in the past experienced cybersecurity breaches on our information technology systems or relating to software that we utilize and while none to date have been material we expect such breaches may continue to occur in the future as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function security and availability of our or our third party vendors’ and other third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors’ control including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

a failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated systems software and technology these systems software and technologies must be refined updated and replaced on a regular basis in order for us to meet our business requirements and our residents’ demands and expectations if we are unable to do so on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost or fail to do so our business could suffer we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new system software or technology and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could adversely affect our results of operation 

social media presents risks the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation further employees or others may disclose nonpublic information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites which could adversely affect our business and results of operations as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements

thirdparty expectations relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks  there is an increasing focus from certain investors tenants employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance factors some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and in some cases may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards in addition the criteria by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are assessed are evolving which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria alternatively if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific thirdparty provider some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies furthermore if our competitors’ corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead in addition in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental social and governance matters we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors tenants and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest could restrict or limit our ability to incur additional debt or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required debt payments and satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders

failure to generate sufficient income could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s or the downreit partnership’s unitholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the income generated by our apartment communities



 

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt including unsecured commercial paper at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2020 udr had approximately 2800 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 55 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2020 the operating partnership had approximately 270 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 271 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt including unsecured commercial paper accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties

the phaseout of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate could have adverse effects in 2018 the alternative reference rate committee identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york by the end of 2021 it is expected that new contracts will not reference libor and will instead use sofr due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate all financial market participants including us are impacted by the risks associated with this transition and therefore it could adversely affect our operations and cash flows

our debt level may be increased our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit construction loans and other forms of secured debt commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated “high volatility commercial real estate” designation which has adversely impacted the availability of loans including construction loans and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of udr’s existing stockholders could be diluted

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets moody’s and standard  poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt commercial paper program and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets including our ability to access the commercial paper market

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control the global equity and credit markets experienced and may experience in the future periods of extraordinary turmoil and volatility as a result of the covid19 pandemic related government actions and uncertainty regarding their duration and impact these circumstances may materially and adversely impact liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive or in some cases unavailable disruptions and uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility and other credit facilities if these institutions become capital constrained tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock

a change in us government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the us have been and may in the future be suggested that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide limitations on the loans that the agencies may make which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect our business and results of operations

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our results of operations

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs

risks related to tax laws

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including for periods prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our regular dividends ie dividends other than capital gain dividends paid to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates however individual us stockholders generally may deduct 20 of such regular dividends under section 199a of the code reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends although such provision will expire after 2025 absent future legislation

udr conduct’s a portion of its business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established and conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a 

question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us federal income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate and reits including the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 federal legislation intended to ameliorate the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” has been enacted that makes technical corrections to or modifies on a temporary basis certain of the provisions of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 and it is possible that additional such legislation may be enacted in the future the full impact of the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 and the cares act may not become evident for some period of time in addition there can be no assurance that future changes to the us federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results the reit rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes if enacted certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results

we cannot predict whether when or to what extent any new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares

we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business we or our affiliates including entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to federal state or local tax audits if we or such entities become subject to federal state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired in addition even 

if the 90 test were met if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were a publicly traded partnership there could be adverse tax impacts for certain limited partners

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations including recently as a result of the covid19 pandemic as a result the market price of udr’s common stock has been and in the future could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including



 

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

business overview

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns operates acquires renovates develops redevelops disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include the operating partnership and the downreit partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures

at december 31 2020 our consolidated real estate portfolio included of 149 communities in 13 states plus the district of columbia totaling of 48283 apartment homes in addition we have an ownership interest in 5295 completed or tobecompleted apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships including 2165 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments the samestore community apartment home population for the year ended december 31 2020 was 37607

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr inc consolidated financial statements included in this report

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were 190 million 135 million and 181 million respectively

investment in unconsolidated entities

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements

impairment of longlived assets

quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant we will assess our real estate properties for indicators 

of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on certain factors such factors include among other things operational performance market conditions the company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties

if a real estate property has indicators of impairment we assess whether the longlived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows which is representative of projected net operating income “noi” plus the residual value of the community our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods if such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

for longlived assets to be disposed of impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost net of accumulated depreciation or fair value less the cost to sell determined on an assetbyasset basis expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred expenditures for improvements renovations and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition

real estate investment properties

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period

reit status

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2020 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets and operations interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 2800 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2020 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 38 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost this analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments

results of operations

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders was 600 million 020 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 1809 million 063 per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year the decrease resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

 

  

this was partially offset by

​ 

 

 

apartment community operations

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 2875 of property revenue and land rent property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations inclusive of corporate management regional supervision accounting and other costs

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc below

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands

noi for our samestore community properties decreased 59 or 402 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 the decrease in property noi was attributable to a 30 or 290 million decrease in property rental income and a 42 or 112 million increase in operating expenses  the decrease in property rental income was primarily driven by an 117 million increase in our reserve on multifamily tenant lease receivables an increase of 151 million in rent concessions and an increase of 100 million in economic occupancy loss partially offset by a 07 or 60 million increase in rental rates and a 17 or 18 million increase in reimbursement and ancillary and fee income physical occupancy decreased by 05 to 963 and total monthly income per occupied home decreased 26 to 2126

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 125 or 48 million increase in repair and maintenance expense due to the increased use of third party vendors partially offset by a 27 or 17 million decrease in personnel expense as a result of fewer employees and a 69 or 77 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 697 and 718 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

nonmature communitiesother

udr’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties

the remaining 245 or 2095 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2020 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother increased by 691 or 856 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to a 631 million increase in noi from stabilized nonmature communities primarily due to communities acquired in 2020 and 2019 a 147 million increase in nonresidentialother primarily due to changes in straightline rent as a result of increased tenant rent concessions during the period and a 72 million increase in acquired communities

real estate depreciation and amortization

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the company recognized real estate depreciation and amortization of 6086 million and 5013 million respectively the increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to communities acquired in 2020 and 2019 partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets

gainloss on sale of real estate owned

during the year ended december 31 2020 the company recognized gains of 1193 million from the sale of three operating communities located in kirkland washington bellevue washington and alexandria virginia 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized a gain of 53 million on the sale of a parcel of land in los angeles california

incomeloss from unconsolidated entities

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 188 million and 1379 million respectively the decrease of 1191 million was primarily due to

 

as compared to

 

interest expense 

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the company recognized interest expense of 2027 million and 1709 million respectively the increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances and the early pay off of debt during 2020 and 2019 resulting in prepayment costs of 492 million and 296 million respectively

interest income and other incomeexpense net 

for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the company recognized interest income and other incomeexpense net of 63 million and 154 million respectively the decrease in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to an 85 million promoted interest on the prepayment of a note to a multifamily technology company in 2019

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

funds from operations

funds from operations “ffo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests and the company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 and restated in november 2018 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock unvested ltip units stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count

management considers ffo a useful metric for investors as the company uses ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of the company’s activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs

funds from operations as adjusted

ffo as adjusted “ffoa” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo excluding the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to acquisition related costs prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement impairment write downs or gains and losses on sales of real estate or other assets incidental to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal and other costs 

management believes that ffoa is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily 

compare our operating results with other reits ffoa is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffoa however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffoa or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffoa may not always be comparable to ffoa or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffoa should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity

adjusted funds from operations

adjusted ffo “affo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffoa less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffoa

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net incomeloss determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

udr is a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities the general partner was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from virginia to maryland in june 2003 at december 31 2020 the general partner’s consolidated real estate portfolio included 149 communities located in 13 states and the district of columbia with a total of 48283 apartment homes in addition the general partner had an ownership interest in 5295 completed or tobecompleted apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships including 2165 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of 

our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were 10 million 10 million and less than 01 million respectively

investment in unconsolidated entities

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements

impairment of longlived assets

quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant we will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on certain factors such factors include among other things operational performance market conditions the operating partnership’s intent and ability to hold the related asset as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties 

​ 

if a real estate property has indicators of impairment we assess whether the longlived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows which is representative of projected net operating income “noi” plus the residual value of the community our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods if such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates and capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

for longlived assets to be disposed of impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost net of accumulated depreciation or fair value less the cost to sell determined on an assetbyasset basis expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred expenditures for improvements renovations and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition

real estate investment properties

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2020

 

 

we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother 

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2019 and held as of december 31 2020 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general 

partner will routinely use its working capital credit facility its unsecured revolving credit facility and issuances of commercial paper to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we continue to execute on maintaining a diversified portfolio

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through net cash provided by property operations borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements and the disposition of properties

future capital needs

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings owed by us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities

as of december 31 2020 the operating partnership does not have any debt maturing in 2021

statements of cash flows

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided byused in operating activities  net cash provided byused in investing activities  and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

operating activities

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash provided byused in operating activities was 2177 million compared to 2551 million for 2019 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net operating income and changes in operating assets and liabilities

investing activities

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash provided byused in investing activities was 1400 million compared to 439 million for 2019 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of two operating communities in 2020 partially offset by proceeds from the sale of an operating community 2020 and a decrease in capital expenditures and other major improvements in 2020 as compared to 2019 

acquisitions 

in november 2020 the operating partnership acquired a 672 apartment home operating community located in tampa florida for approximately 1225 million the operating partnership increased its real estate assets owned by approximately 1194 million and recorded approximately 31 million of inplace lease intangibles

​ 

in december 2020 the operating partnership acquired a 400 apartment home operating community located in herndon virginia for approximately 1286 million the operating partnership increased its real estate assets owned by approximately 1259 million and recorded approximately 27 million of inplace lease intangibles

​ 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions of real estate 

dispositions

in october 2020 the operating partnership sold an operating community located in alexandria virginia with a total of 332 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 1450 million resulting in a gain of approximately 580 million 

the proceeds were designated for a taxdeferred section 1031 exchange and were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for acquisitions in november and december 2020

​ 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the operating partnership did not have any dispositions of real estate

financing activities

for the year ended december 31 2020 net cash provided byused in financing activities was 766 million compared to 2109 million for 2019 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in repayments of notes payable to the general partner partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of secured debt in 2019

guarantor on unsecured debt 

the operating partnership is the guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 11 billion an unsecured commercial paper program with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 500 million a 350 million term loan due september 2023 300 million of mediumterm notes due october 2025 300 million of mediumterm notes due september 2026 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2027 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2028 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2029 600 million of mediumterm notes due january 2030 400 million of mediumterm notes due august 2031 400 million of mediumterm notes due august 2032 350 million of mediumterm notes due march 2033 and 300 million of mediumterm notes due november 2034 as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the general partner did not have an outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility and had 1900 million and 3000 million respectively outstanding under its unsecured commercial paper program

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 270 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2020 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 03 million based on the average balance at december 31 2020

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such amount management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments owed by the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 9 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders was 1342 million 073 per diluted op unit for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to net income of 1022 million 056 per diluted op unit for the prior year the increase in net income attributable to op unitholders resulted primarily from the following items which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

 

this was partially offset by

 

apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi are property management costs which are the operating partnership’s allocable share of costs incurred by the general partner for shared services of corporate level property management employees and related support functions and costs

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization

although we consider noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders below

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands

samestore communities

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2019 and held as of december 31 2020 consisted of 15609 apartment homes and provided 931 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2020

noi for our samestore community properties decreased 59 or 177 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 31 or 127 million decrease in property rental income and a 49 or 50 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in property rental income was primarily driven by a 61 million increase in our reserve on multifamily tenant lease receivables a 59 million increase in rent concessions and a 47 million increase in economic occupancy loss partially offset by a 08 or 31 million increase in rental rates and a 20 or 09 million increase in reimbursement and ancillary and fee income physical occupancy decreased 08 to 960 and total monthly income per occupied home decreased 24 to 2173

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 159 or 26 million increase in repair and maintenance expense due to the increased use of third party vendors partially offset by a 90 or 20 million decrease in personnel expense as a result of fewer employees and a 78 or 30 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 723 and 744 for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively

nonmature communitiesother

the operating partnership’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

the remaining 69 or 208 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2020 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 86 or 20 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 43 million from stabilized nonmature communities and a decrease of 13 million from sold and held for disposition communities partially offset by an increase of 25 million from nonresidentialother primarily due to changes in straightline rent as a result of increased tenant rent concessions during 2020 and an increase of 12 million from acquired communities 

other operating expense 

for the year ended december 31 2020 other operating expense increased by 701 or 67 million as compared to 2019 which was primarily due to higher ground lease expense in 2020 as a result of a rent reset provision on one of our ground leases

gainloss on sale of real estate owned

during the year ended december 31 2020 the operating partnership recognized a gain of 580 million on the sale of an operating community in alexandria virginia with a total of 332 apartment homes during the year ended december 31 2019 the operating partnership did not recognize any gains on the sale of real estate 

inflation

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2020

our strategic vision 

our strategic vision is to be the multifamily public reit of choice we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives which are

 

maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 

we believe greater portfolio diversification as defined by geographic concentration location within a market ie urban or suburban and property quality ie a or b reduces the volatility of our samestore growth throughout the real estate cycle appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio diversified characteristics of our portfolio include

 

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research

acquisitions and dispositions 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider a wide variety of factors including



 

we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include

 

the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

the following table summarizes the operating partnership’s apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands 

 



development activities 

our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio how demographic trends economic drivers and multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the longterm and our portfolio strategy generally govern our review process on where and when to allocate development capital at december 31 2019 the company was developing three whollyowned communities located in denver colorado addison texas and dublin california totaling 878 homes none of which have been completed with a budget of 2785 million in which we have a carrying value of 698 million the communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred 356 million in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings as of december 31 2019 the company was redeveloping 653 apartment homes 250 of which have been completed at two whollyowned communities located in boston massachusetts and new york new york both of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 the redevelopments include the renovation of building exteriors corridors and common area amenities as well as individual apartment homes

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement

maintaining a strong balance sheet 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities

consistently driving operational excellence 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our business and our residents our residents can conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal or increasingly a smartdevice application

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction has improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic vision is the same as that of the company described above

competitive conditions

competition for new residents is generally intense across our markets some competing communities offer amenities that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include

 

moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with metrics that impact our bottomline performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside

communities

at december 31 2019 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 148 communities with a total of 47010 completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 52 communities with a total of 16434 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents

at december 31 2019 the company was developing three whollyowned communities located in denver colorado dublin california and addison texas totaling 878 homes none of which have been completed with a budget of 2785 million in which we have a carrying value of 698 million the communities are estimated to be completed between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022

at december 31 2019 the company was redeveloping 653 apartment homes 250 of which have been completed at two whollyowned communities located in boston massachusetts and new york new york both of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021 the redevelopments include the renovation of building exteriors corridors and common area amenities as well as individual apartment homes

samestore community comparison

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year

net income attributable to common stockholders was 1809 million as compared to 1992 million in the prior year period the decrease was primarily driven by higher gains on the sale of real estate in the prior year and an increase in depreciation expense and interest expense in 2019 partially offset by higher total revenue and gains on the sale of unconsolidated real estate

for the year ended december 31 2019 our samestore noi increased by 267 million compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 854 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in noi for the 37959 samestore apartment homes or 807 of our portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates an increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income and a decrease in personnel expense partially offset by an increase in repair and maintenance expense and real estate taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2019 the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased by 103 million compared to the prior year the operating partnership’s samestore community properties provided 929 of its total noi for the year ended december 31 2019 the increase in noi for the 15723 samestore apartment homes or 957 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates an increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income and a decrease in personnel expense partially offset by an increase in repair and maintenance expense and real estate taxes

revenue growth in 2020 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents

tax matters

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level

inflation

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2019

environmental matters

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development 

of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition

insurance

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

risk factors

tableend there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession debt levels housing markets stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels and rental revenues would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others

 

the geographic concentration of our communities in certain markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely impacted by economic or other conditions for the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 527 of our total noi was generated from communities located in the washington dc metropolitan area 162 orange county ca 142 the san francisco bay area ca 122 and new york ny 101 as a result if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or real estate market conditions such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse in addition if one or more of these markets is adversely affected by changes in regional or local regulations including those related to rent control or stabilization such regulations may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operation than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms furthermore because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases generally five to ten years with marketbased or fixedprice renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small andor local businesses may subject us to certain risks the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time tenants may provide guarantees and other credit support which may prove to be inadequate or uncollectable and the failure rate of small andor local businesses may be higher than average we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our retail or commercial space terminate either at the end of the lease or because a tenant leaves early the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the prior lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition

​ 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt general and administrative expenses and other expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold or the purchase price may be reduced to cover any cost of correcting defects or making improvements these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties development or redevelopment or funding the developer capital program we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities among others

 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks among others

 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks among others



 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities or joint venture partners among others as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures including those in which we own a preferred interest with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures as of december 31 2019 we had active joint ventures and partnerships including our preferred equity investments with a total equity investment of 5883 million we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which could adversely impact us moreover our partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might fail to make capital contributions when due which may require us to contribute additional capital or may negatively impact the project in addition we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income

we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures including i a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions which could result in litigation or disposing of an asset at a time at which we otherwise would not sell the asset ii limitations on our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner and iii requirements to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance however subject to certain conditions we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability deductibles and selfinsured retentions customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses 

in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a component of expense insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure or exit or partial exit from an insurance market of one or more insurance companies may affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts that we seek or at all or increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or cause us to selfinsure a portion of the risk or increase the cost of insuring properties

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others

 

failure to succeed with new initiatives may limit our ability to grow samestore noi  we have in the past developed and may in the future develop initiatives that are intended to drive operating efficiencies and grow samestore noi including smart home technologies and selfservice options that are accessible to residents through smart devices we may incur significant costs and divert resources in connection with such initiatives and these initiatives may not perform as projected which could adversely affect our results of operations and the market price of udr’s common stock

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants claims have been asserted and in the future claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition if claims arise we may expend resources and incur costs in investigating and resolving such claims even if our property was in compliance with the law

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

the adoption of or changes to rent control rent stabilization eviction tenants’ rights and similar laws and regulations in our markets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and property values various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control rent stabilization or limitations and similar laws and regulations that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees including laws or court orders either of which could have a retroactive effect for example in june 2019 the state of new york enacted new rent control regulations known as the housing stability and tenant protection act of 2019 and in october of 2019 the state of california enacted the tenant protection act of 2019 we have seen a recent increase in governments enacting or considering or being urged to consider such laws and regulations state and local governments or courts also may make changes to laws related to allowable fees eviction and other tenants’ rights laws and regulations including changes that apply retroactively that could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our properties laws and regulations regarding rent control rent stabilization eviction tenants’ rights and similar matters as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such laws and regulations may limit our ability to charge market rents limit our ability to increase rents evict delinquent tenants or change fees or recover increases in our operating expenses which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our properties

ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions ii laws and regulations regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 or iii employment related laws may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change may result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and also may require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes floods snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

risk of potential climate change  to the extent significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located occur we may experience extreme weather conditions and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or communities that are otherwise affected by these changes should the impact of such climate changes be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in areas subject to earthquakes including in the general vicinity of earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical

risk of accidental death or injury due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

risk of pandemics or other health crisis  a pandemic epidemic or other health crisis where our communities are located or areas in which vendors on which we rely are located could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we have in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or subordinated loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may 

not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our investment in addition mezzanine loans typically have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal

risk related to preferred equity investments we have in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property generally we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors managers general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests further if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property or refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all in addition we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent we may lose our entire investment in the entity

risks related to ground leases we have in the past and may in the future enter into as either landlord or tenant a longterm ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors for example fair market rent that are not objective and are not within our control we may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted in the past we have had disagreements with respect to revised rental rates and certain of such disagreements have gone to arbitration for resolution as provided in the applicable lease agreement and have been resolved in a manner adverse to us in addition the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations in addition if we have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr’s common stock

a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation we rely on information technology systems including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties 

to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes third party vendors collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants prospective tenants and employees we also maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems while we take steps and generally require third party vendors to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors’ information technology systems including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information it is possible that our or our third party vendors’ security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems’ improper functioning or the loss misappropriation disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information including information about our tenants and employees cybersecurity breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses phishing scams attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or misconduct and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach we have in the past experienced cybersecurity breaches on our information technology systems and while none to date have been material we expect such breaches may occur in the future as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function security and availability of our or our third party vendors’ and other third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors’ control including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

social media presents risks the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation further employees or others may disclose nonpublic information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites which could adversely affect our business and results of operations as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements

thirdparty expectations relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks  there is an increasing focus from certain investors tenants employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance factors some investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and in some cases may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate thirdparty providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports on companies have increased in number resulting in varied and in some cases inconsistent standards in addition the criteria by which companies’ corporate responsibility practices are assessed are evolving which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria alternatively if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific thirdparty provider some investors may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies furthermore if our competitors’ corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours potential or current investors may elect to invest with our competitors instead in addition in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental social and governance matters we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors tenants and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required debt payments and satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders

failure to generate sufficient income could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s or the downreit partnership’s unitholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the income generated by our apartment communities

 

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt including unsecured commercial paper at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2019 udr had approximately 3786 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 80 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2019 the operating partnership had approximately 270 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 271 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt including unsecured commercial paper accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties

the phaseout of libor and transition to sofr as a benchmark interest rate could have adverse effects in 2018 the alternative reference rate committee identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as the alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities published by the federal reserve bank of new york by the end of 2021 it is expected that new contracts will not reference libor and will instead use sofr due to the broad use of libor as a reference rate all financial market participants including us are impacted by the risks associated with this transition and therefore it could adversely affect our operations and cash flows

our debt level may be increased our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit construction loans and other forms of secured debt commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated “high volatility commercial real estate” designation which has adversely impacted the availability of loans including construction loans and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of udr’s existing stockholders could be diluted

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets moody’s and standard  poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt commercial paper program and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets including our ability to access the commercial paper market

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing such as the commercial paper market any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for 

acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock

a change in us government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the us have been and may in the future be suggested that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide limitations on the loans that the agencies may make which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect our business and results of operations

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our results of operations

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs

risks related to tax laws

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including for periods prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the 

internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our regular dividends ie dividends other than capital gain dividends paid to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates however individual us stockholders generally may deduct 20 of such regular dividends under section 199a of the code reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends although such provision will expire after 2025 absent future legislation

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results in recent years numerous legislative judicial and administrative changes have been made to the us federal income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate and reits including the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the full impact of which may not become evident for some period of time there can be no assurance that future changes to the us federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results the reit rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the 

us treasury department which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes if enacted certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

we cannot predict whether when or to what extent any new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares

we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business we or our affiliates including entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to federal state or local tax audits if we or such entities become subject to federal state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired in addition even if the 90 test were met if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were a publicly traded partnership there could be adverse tax impacts for certain limited partners

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s 

common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be 

in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

udr inc

business overview

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns operates acquires renovates develops redevelops disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include the operating partnership and the downreit partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures

at december 31 2019 our consolidated real estate portfolio consisted of 148 communities located in 13 states plus the district of columbia consisting of 47010 apartment homes in addition we have an ownership interest in 5268 completed or tobecompleted apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships including 2138 apartment homes owned by entities in which we hold preferred equity investments

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr inc consolidated financial statements included in this report

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 were 135 million 181 million and 274 million respectively

investment in unconsolidated entities

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements

impairment of longlived assets

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market 

value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

real estate investment properties

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period

reit status

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2019 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2019

 

 

we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother 

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2018 and held as of december 31 2019 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our working capital credit facility and commercial paper program and may use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we continue to execute on maintaining a diversified portfolio

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through net cash provided by property operations secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities andor dispositions of properties

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

in july 2017 the company entered into an atm sales agreement under which the company may offer and sell up to 200 million shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents and may enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers upon entering into the atm sales agreement the company simultaneously terminated the sales agreement for its prior atthemarket equity offering program which was entered into in april 2017 which replaced the prior atthemarket equity offering program entered into in april 2012 during the year ended december 31 2019 the company sold 70 million shares of common stock through its atm program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3165 million at a weighted average price per share of 4529 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 40 million were approximately 3123 million which were primarily used to fund the company’s recent acquisitions as of december 31 2019 we had 117 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the atm program

 ​ 

the above table includes amounts capitalized during the year actual capital spending is impacted by the net change in capital expenditure accruals

we intend to continue to selectively add noi enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement

credit facilities and commercial paper program

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company prepaid the 900 million outstanding balance under its secured credit facility with fannie mae from proceeds received from the refinancing of the debt this transaction was accounted for as a debt modification

​ 

in november 2019 the company assumed a secured credit facility with new york life with an outstanding balance of 2050 million and a fair value of 2193 million in connection with the acquisition of the approximately 50 ownership not previously owned in four operating communities from the udrmetlife joint venture the credit facility is a pooled facility and secured by those four properties the credit facility is due in january 2023 and has an interest rate of 490 see note 3 real estate owned 

the company has a 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a 3500 million unsecured term loan the credit agreement for these facilities allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2023 with two sixmonth extension options subject to certain conditions the term loan has a scheduled maturity date of september 30 2023 

based on the company’s current credit rating the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 825 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points and the term loan has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 75 to 145 basis points the facility fee ranges from 10 to 30 basis points and the margin under the term loan ranges from 80 to 165 basis points

as of december 31 2019 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility leaving 11 billion of unused capacity excluding 29 million of letters of credit at december 31 2019 and 3500 million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan

we have a working capital credit facility which provides for a 75 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “working capital credit facility” with a scheduled maturity date of january 15 2021 based on the company’s current credit rating the working capital credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 825 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin ranges from 75 to 145 basis points 

as of december 31 2019 we had 166 million of outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility leaving 584 million of unused capacity

the bank revolving credit facilities and the term loan are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we were in compliance with at december 31 2019

we have an unsecured commercial paper program under the terms of the program we may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of 500 million the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured indebtedness the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership as of december 31 2019 we had issued 3000 million of commercial paper for one month terms at a weighted average annualized rate of 199 leaving 2000 million of unused capacity

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 3786 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2019 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 35 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost this analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments

results of operations

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders was 1809 million 063 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 1992 million 074 per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year the decrease resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

 

 

this was partially offset by

​ 



 

apartment community operations

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 2875 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc below

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 ​ 

the following table is our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to udr inc to total property noi for the periods presented  dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

samestore communities

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2018 and held on december 31 2019 consisted of 37959 apartment homes and provided 854 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2019

noi for our samestore community properties increased 40 or 267 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 36 or 334 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 25 or 67 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 28 or 243 million increase in rental rates and a 108 or 101 million increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income physical occupancy stayed the same at 969 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 35 to 2180

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 154 or 51 million increase in repair and maintenance expense due to the increased use of third party vendors partially offset by a 83 or 49 million decrease in personnel expense as a result of fewer employees and a 45 or 48 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 718 and 715 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively

nonmature communitiesother

udr’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties

the remaining 146 or 1179 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2019 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother increased by 724 or 495 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 the increase was primarily attributable to a 670 million increase in noi from stabilized nonmature communities primarily due to communities acquired in 2019 and recently developed communities partially offset by a 102 million decrease in noi from sold and held for disposition communities in 2018 and a 54 million decrease in nonresidentialother noi

real estate depreciation and amortization

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company recognized real estate depreciation and amortization of 5013 million and 4290 million respectively the increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to communities acquired in 2019 and homes delivered from our development communities in 2018 partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets

gainloss on sale of real estate owned

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company recognized a gain of 53 million on the sale of a parcel of land in los angeles california

during the year ended december 31 2018 the company recognized gains of 1362 million on the sale of two operating communities in huntington beach california and fairfax virginia

incomeloss from unconsolidated entities

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 1379 million and 51 million respectively the increase of 1430 million was primarily due to

 

as compared to

 

interest expense 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company recognized interest expense of 1709 million and 1342 million respectively the increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances lower capitalized interest and the early pay off of debt during 2019 resulting in prepayment costs of 274 million

interest income and other incomeexpense net 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the company recognized interest income and other incomeexpense net of 154 million and 67 million respectively the increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to an 85 million promoted interest on the prepayment of a note to a multifamily technology company 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2019

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 dollars in thousands 

 

 

during 2019 we incurred gross interest costs of 1760 million of which 51 million was capitalized

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations

funds from operations

funds from operations “ffo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are directly attributable to decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate related to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests and the company’s share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 and restated in november 2018 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock unvested ltip units stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count

management considers ffo a useful metric for investors as the company uses ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of the company’s activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs

funds from operations as adjusted

ffo as adjusted “ffoa” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo excluding the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to acquisition related costs prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement impairment write downs or gains and losses on sales of real estate or other assets incidental to the main business of the company and income taxes directly associated with those gains and losses casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal and other costs 

management believes that ffoa is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily 

compare our operating results with other reits ffoa is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffoa however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffoa or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffoa may not always be comparable to ffoa or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffoa should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity

adjusted funds from operations

adjusted ffo “affo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffoa less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffoa

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net incomeloss determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

the following table outlines our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders to ffo ffoa and affo for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  dollars in thousands

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found 

in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report

cost capitalization

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 were 10 million less than 01 million and 05 million respectively

investment in unconsolidated entities

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements

impairment of longlived assets

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

real estate investment properties

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon 

acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2019

 

 

we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother 

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2018 and held as of december 31 2019 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its working capital credit facility and commercial paper program and may use its unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we continue to execute on maintaining a diversified portfolio

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through net cash provided by property operations borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements and the disposition of properties

future capital needs

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings owed by us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities

as of december 31 2019 the operating partnership did not have any debt maturing in 2020

statements of cash flows

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided byused in operating activities  net cash provided byused in investing activities  and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

operating activities

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash provided byused in operating activities was 2551 million compared to 2557 million for 2018 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in interest expense and changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by an increase in net operating income primarily driven by revenue growth at communities

investing activities

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash provided byused in investing activities was 439 million compared to 717 million for 2018 the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of an operating community and a commercial office building in 2018 and an increase in capital expenditures and other major improvements during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 

acquisitions 

during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions of real estate 

dispositions

during the year ended december 31 2019 the operating partnership did not have any dispositions of real estate

in december 2018 the operating partnership sold a commercial office building in fairfax virginia for gross proceeds of 93 million resulting in a gain of 52 million 

in february 2018 the operating partnership sold an operating community in orange county california with a total of 264 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 905 million resulting in a gain of 703 million the proceeds were designated for a taxdeferred section 1031 exchange that were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition in october 2017

financing activities

for the year ended december 31 2019 net cash provided byused in financing activities was 2109 million compared to 3265 million for 2018 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt a decrease in payments on secured debt and a decrease in advances to the general partner partially offset by the repayment of notes payable to the general partner

guarantor on unsecured debt 

the operating partnership is the guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 11 billion an unsecured commercial paper program with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 500 million a 350 million term loan due september 2023 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2024 300 million of mediumterm notes due october 2025 300 million of mediumterm notes due september 2026 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2027 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2028 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2029 400 million of mediumterm notes due january 2030 400 million of mediumterm notes due august 2031 and 300 million of mediumterm notes due november 2034 as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the general partner did not have an outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility and had 3000 million and 1011 million respectively outstanding under its unsecured commercial paper program

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations

interest rate risk

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 270 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2019 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 03 million based on the average balance at december 31 2019

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments owed by the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 9 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows  dollars in thousands

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders was 1022 million 056 per diluted op unit for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to net income of 2298 million 125 per diluted op unit for the comparable period in the prior year the decrease in net income attributable to op unitholders resulted primarily from the following items which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

 

this was partially offset by

 

apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi are property management costs which are the operating partnership’s allocable share of costs incurred by the general partner for shared services of corporate level property management employees and related support functions and costs

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization

although we consider noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders below

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 ​ 

the following table is our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders to total property noi for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 dollars in thousands 

 ​ 

samestore communities

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2018 and held as of december 31 2019 consisted of 15723 apartment homes and provided 929 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2019

noi for our samestore community properties increased 36 or 103 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 35 or 138 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 34 or 35 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 28 or 102 million increase in rental rates and a 109 or 45 million increase in reimbursement ancillary and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 968 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 35 to 2215

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an 182 or 25 million increase in repair and maintenance expense due to the increased use of third party vendors partially offset by an 81 or 19 million 

decrease in personnel expense as a result of fewer employees and a 65 or 24 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 742 for both of the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018

nonmature communitiesother

the operating partnership’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

the remaining 71 or 228 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2019 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 171 or 47 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 22 million from nonresidentialother communities a decrease of 21 million from redevelopment communities and a decrease of 09 million from sold and held for disposition communities which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 05 million from stabilized nonmature communities 

real estate depreciation and amortization

for the year ended december 31 2019 real estate depreciation and amortization decreased by 25 or 35 million as compared to the same period in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to the sale of an operating community and a commercial office building in 2018 and fully depreciated assets

real estate taxes and insurance 

for the year ended december 31 2019 real estate taxes and insurance increased by 83 or 39 million as compare to 2018 which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations in 2019

incomeloss in unconsolidated entities

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 83 million and 435 million respectively the decrease from unconsolidated entities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the sale of an operating community in 2018 held in the downreit partnership

gainloss on sale of real estate owned

during the year ended december 31 2019 the operating partnership did not recognize any gains on the sale of real estate during the year ended december 31 2018 the operating partnership recognized total gains of 755 million on the sale of an operating community in orange county california with a total of 264 apartment homes and a commercial office building in fairfax virginia

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2019 interest expense increased by 299 or 68 million as compared to 2018 which was primarily due to the conversion in 2018 of the advances tofrom the general partner capital balance into an unsecured revolving note payable with the general partner

inflation

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2019

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

contractual obligations

maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 

we believe greater portfolio diversification as defined by geographic concentration location within a market ie urban or suburban and property quality ie a or b reduces the volatility of our samestore growth throughout the real estate cycle appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio diversified characteristics of our portfolio include 





we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

acquisitions and dispositions 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider a wide variety of factors including 















 











we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 











the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



  

the following table summarizes the operating partnership’s apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



aincludes 3107 homes deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the operating partnership to the downreit partnership 

development activities 

our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio demographic trends economic drivers and how multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the longterm generally govern our review process on where to allocate development capital at december 31 2018 no communities were under development during the year ended december 31 2018 we completed the development of two whollyowned communities located in huntington beach california and boston massachusetts with a total of 1101 homes 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during the year ended december 31 2018 we incurred 228 million in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings as of december 31 2018 no communities were under redevelopment 

 

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

maintaining a strong balance sheet 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities 

consistently driving operational excellence 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal 

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction has improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic vision is the same as that of the company as described above 

competitive conditions 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 





 







moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

communities 

at december 31 2018 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities with a total of 39931 completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 52 communities with a total of 16434 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2018 no communities were under development or redevelopment 

samestore community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

net income attributable to common stockholders was 1992 million as compared to 1179 million in the prior year period the increase was primarily driven by higher operating income including gains on the sale of real estate 

for the year ended december 31 2018 our samestore noi increased by 220 million compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 918 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in noi for the 37673 samestore apartment homes or 943 of our portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and reimbursements and ancillary and fee income partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2018 the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased by 125 million compared to the prior year the operating partnership’s samestore community properties provided 960 of its total noi for the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in noi for the 16216 samestore apartment homes or 987 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and reimbursements and ancillary and fee income partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes 

revenue growth in 2019 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2018 

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical 

 

damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1arisk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate or unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels housing markets stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 





















the geographic concentration of our communities in certain markets could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely impacted by economic or other conditions for the year ended december 31 2018 approximately 523 of our total noi was generated from communities located in the washington dc metropolitan area 170 orange county ca 128 the san francisco bay area ca 122 and new york ny 103 as a result if any one or more of these markets is adversely impacted by regional or local economic conditions or local real estate market conditions or regulations such conditions may have a greater adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse 

we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet 

 

their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms furthermore because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase 

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small andor local businesses may subject us to certain risks the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our retail or commercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the prior lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or our ability to fund other activities in which we may want to engage such as the purchase of properties development or redevelopment or funding the developer capital program we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities among others 





competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities 

 

that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks among others 















competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks among others 













 



bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties or their subcontractors could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures including those in which we own a preferred interest with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures as of december 31 2018 we had active joint ventures and partnerships including our preferred equity investments with a total equity investment of 7809 million we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property or otherwise adversely impact us moreover our partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process and could cause us to recognize unanticipated capital gains or losses or the loss of fee income 

we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures including i a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers or dispose of the property in a transaction in which a gain is not recognized for federal income tax purposes by such sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance however subject to certain conditions we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our properties and operating activities with limits of liability deductibles and selfinsured retentions customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a component of expense insurance premiums and the terms and conditions of insurance policies are subject to significant fluctuations and changes which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure or exit from the insurance market of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 









potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or 

 

irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements and federal state and local accessibility requirements in addition to those imposed by the americans with disabilities act if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders we are subject to federal state and local laws regulations rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or unanticipated reductions in revenue which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change may result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and also may require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes floods snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas should the impact of such climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may 

 

experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death or injury due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we have in the past and may in the future originate mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our investment in addition mezzanine loans typically have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

risk related to preferred equity investments we have in the past and may in the future make preferred equity investments in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property generally we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors managers general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests further if our partners were to fail to invest additional capital in the entity when required we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property or refinance property indebtedness or sell the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all in addition we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent we may lose our entire investment in the entity 

risks related to ground leases we have in the past and may in the future enter into as either landlord or tenant a longterm ground lease with respect to a property or a portion thereof such ground leases may contain a rent reset provision that requires both parties to agree to a new rent or is based upon factors for example fair market rent that are not objective and are not within our control we may not be able to agree with the counterparty to a revised rental rate or the revised rental rate may be set by external factors which could result in a different rental rate than we forecasted in addition the other party may not perform as expected under the ground lease or there may be a dispute with the other party to the ground lease any of these circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we 

 

were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation we rely on information technology systems including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes third party vendors collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants prospective tenants and employees we also maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems while we take steps and generally require third party vendors to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors’ information technology systems including associate training and testing and the use of commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing of the information it is possible that our or our third party vendors’ security measures will not be able to prevent human error or the systems’ improper functioning or the loss misappropriation disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information including information about our tenants and employees cybersecurity breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses phishing scams attacks by hackers breaches due to employee error or misconduct and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties or otherwise cause disruption or negative impacts to occur to our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function security and availability of our or our third party vendors’ and other third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors’ control including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

social media presents risks the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation further employees or others may disclose nonpublic information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites which could adversely affect our business and results of operations as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges 

 

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient income could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders or the operating partnership’s or the downreit partnership’s unitholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the income generated by our apartment communities 



















expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments 

 

we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt including unsecured commercial paper at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2018 udr had approximately 2308 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 65 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2018 the operating partnership had approximately 270 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes all outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt including unsecured commercial paper accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties 

our debt level may be increased our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit construction loans and other forms of secured debt commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated “high volatility commercial real estate” designation which has adversely impacted the availability of loans including construction loans and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of udr’s existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets moody’s and standard  poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt commercial paper program and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets including our ability to access the commercial paper market 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing such as the commercial paper market any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock 

a change in us government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing 

 

market including potential purchasers of our properties potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the us have been suggested including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide limitations on the loans that the agencies may make which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our results of operations 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including for periods prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our regular dividends ie dividends other than capital gain dividends to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates however under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 our individual us stockholders generally may deduct 20 of such regular dividends under section 199a of the code reducing the effective tax rate applicable to such dividends although such provision will expire after 2025 absent future legislation 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for certain of these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders the impact of the act on us and our stockholders is uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time for example the act contained provisions that may reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit including the lowering of income tax rates on individuals and corporations which eases the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and potentially causes the single level of taxation on reit distributions to become relatively less attractive the act also contains provisions allowing the expensing of capital expenditures which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for reits and provisions extending the depreciable lives of certain real estate assets and further limiting the deductibility of interest expense which could negatively impact the real estate market in addition although the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was recently passed there can be no assurance that future changes to the us federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results the reit rules are regularly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes if enacted certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 

 

we cannot predict whether when or to what extent the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and any new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares 

we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business we or our affiliates including entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to federal state or local tax audits if we or such entities become subject to federal state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in 

 

this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 







































many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock 

 

representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

udr inc 

business overview 

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns operates acquires renovates develops redevelops disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include the operating partnership and the downreit partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures 

at december 31 2018 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities in 11 states plus the district of columbia totaling 39931 apartment homes and our total real estate portfolio inclusive of our unconsolidated communities included an additional 32 communities with 8112 apartment homes 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr inc consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were 181 million 274 million and 244 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated entities 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the 

 

fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2018 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 





we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2017 and held as of december 31 2018 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our 

 

unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we continue to excute on maintaining a diversified portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through net cash provided by property operations secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities andor dispositions of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

in september 2018 the company entered into a 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a 3500 million unsecured term loan the credit agreement for these facilities allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2023 with two sixmonth extension options subject to certain conditions the term loan has a scheduled maturity date of september 30 2023 

the credit agreement amended and restated the company’s prior credit agreement which provided for i a 11 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in january 2020 and ii a 3500 million term loan scheduled to mature in january 2021 the prior credit agreement allowed the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion subject to certain conditions 

based on the company’s current credit rating the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 825 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points and the term loan has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 75 to 145 basis points the facility fee ranges from 10 to 30 basis points and the margin under the term loan ranges from 80 to 165 basis points

we have a working capital credit facility which provides for a 75 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “working capital credit facility” with a scheduled maturity date of january 15 2021 based on the company’s current credit rating the working capital credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 825 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin ranges from 75 to 145 basis points in february 2018 we amended the working capital credit facility to extend the scheduled maturity date from january 1 2019 to january 15 2021 in september 2018 the company further amended the working capital credit facility to lower the margin to the ranges disclosed above which are consistent with the margins for the 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility described above

the fannie mae credit facility the bank revolving credit facilities and the term loan are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which we were in compliance with at december 31 2018 

we have an unsecured commercial paper program under the terms of the program we may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of 500 million the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured indebtedness the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership as of december 31 2018 we had issued 1011 million of commercial paper for one month terms at a weighted average annualized rate of 290 leaving 3989 million of unused capacity 

 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 2308 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2018 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 54 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost this analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 13 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments

apartment community operations 

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc below

noi for our samestore community properties increased 34 or 220 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 35 or 314 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 36 or 94 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 21 or 176 million increase in rental rates and an 115 or 96 million increase in reimbursements and ancillary and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 969 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 33 to 2145 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 91 or 91 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations

during the year ended december 31 2016 the company sold eight operating communities with a total of 1782 apartment homes a retail center and its 95 interest in two land parcels resulting in gains of 2262 million 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2018 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock unvested ltip units stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count 

we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs 

funds from operations as adjusted 

ffo as adjusted “ffoa” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other noncomparable items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains or losses on sales of nondepreciable property and marketable securities deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases casualtyrelated charges and recoveries severance costs and legal costs 

management believes that ffoa is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits ffoa is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period 

 

and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffoa however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffoa or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffoa may not always be comparable to ffoa or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffoa should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 

adjusted funds from operations 

adjusted ffo “affo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffoa less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffoa 

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net incomeloss determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

a during the year ended december 31 2018 the company recorded a gain of 21 million as a result of measuring an investment in equity securities subject to updated accounting guidance effective for the company on january 1 2018 as the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value the company elected the measurement alternative under which the investment is measured at cost less any impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer

udr is a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities the general partner was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from virginia to maryland in june 2003 at december 31 2018 the general partner’s consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities located in 11 states and the district of columbia with a total of 39931 apartment homes in addition the general partner had an ownership interest in 32 communities with 8112 completed apartment homes through unconsolidated operating communities 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found 

 

in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 were less than 01 million 05 million and 08 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated entities 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon 

 

acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 





we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2017 and held as of december 31 2018 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we continue to excute on maintaining a diversified portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through net cash provided by property operations borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements and the disposition of properties 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings owed by us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2018 the operating partnership does not have any secured debt maturing in 2019 

statements of cash flows 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided byused in operating activities  net cash provided byused in investing activities  and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash provided byused in operating activities was 2557 million compared to 2353 million for 2017 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved operating income primarily driven by revenue growth at communities and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided byused in operating activities was 2353 million compared to 2289 million for 2016 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved operating income primarily driven by revenue growth at communities and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash provided byused in investing activities was 717 million compared to 1060 million for 2017 the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to increased proceeds received from the sale of an operating community and a commercial office building and decreased cash used for the acquisition of real estate in 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided byused in investing activities was 1060 million compared to 95 million for 2016 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of an operating community partially offset by the disposition of two operating communities in 2017 

 

acquisitions

during the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership acquired an operating community located in denver colorado with a total of 218 apartment homes and 17000 square feet of retail space for a purchase price of approximately 1415 million the acquisition was funded with section 1031 exchanges

in february 2018 the operating partnership sold an operating community in orange county california with a total of 264 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 905 million resulting in a gain of 703 million the proceeds were designated for a taxdeferred section 1031 exchange that were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition in october 2017 

during the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership sold two operating communities with a total of 218 apartment homes in orange county california and carlsbad california for gross proceeds of 690 million resulting in a gain of 413 million 

during the year ended december 31 2016 the operating partnership sold two operating communities in the baltimore maryland market with a total of 276 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 453 million resulting in a gain net of tax of 332 million 

financing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2018 net cash provided byused in financing activities was 3265 million compared to 1288 million for 2017 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in advances to the general partner partially offset by a decrease in payments on secured debt and an increase in issuance of notes payable to the general partner 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided byused in financing activities was 1288 million compared to 2215 million for 2016 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in advances from the general partner partially offset by the early repayment of debt maturing in december 2018 july 2020 and july 2023 

credit facilities 

during the year ended december 31 2018 1332 million of funds borrowed under the fannie mae credit facilities and owed by the operating partnership were prepaid the operating partnership incurred prepayment costs of 18 million during the year ended december 31 2018 which were included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 11 billion an unsecured commercial paper program with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 500 million 300 million of mediumterm notes due october 2020 400 million of mediumterm notes due january 2022 a 350 million term loan due september 2023 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2024 300 million of mediumterm notes due october 2025 300 million of mediumterm notes due september 2026 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2027 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2028 and 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2029 as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the general partner did not have an outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility and had 1011 million and 3000 million respectively outstanding under its unsecured commercial paper program 

on october 26 2018 the general partner issued 3000 million of 440 senior unsecured mediumterm notes due january 26 2029  427 effective rate after the effect of a cash flow hedge  the general partner used the net 

 

proceeds for the repayment of debt including all of the fannie mae credit facilities allocated to the operating partnership and for general corporate purposes the operating partnership is a guarantor of this debt 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 270 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2018 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 03 million based on the average balance at december 31 2018 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments owed by the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 8 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders 

2018 vs 2017 

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders was 2298 million 125 per diluted op unit for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to net income of 1063 million 058 per diluted op unit for the comparable period in the prior year the increase in net income attributable to op unitholders resulted primarily from the following items which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 







 





2017 vs 2016 

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders was 1063 million 058 per diluted op unit for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to net income of 778 million 042 per diluted op unit for the comparable period in the prior year the increase in net income attributable to op unitholders resulted primarily from the following items which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 







this was partially offset by 

  



apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi are property management costs which are the operating partnership’s allocable share of costs incurred by the general partner for shared services of corporate level property management employees and related support functions and costs 

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization 

although we consider noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders below 

 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented 











  

the following table is our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders to total property noi for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 dollars in thousands  



  

samestore communities 

2018 vs 2017 

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2017 and held as of december 31 2018 consisted of 16216 apartment homes and provided 960 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2018 

noi for our samestore community properties increased 43 or 125 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2017 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 38 or 149 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 23 or 25 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 23 or 87 million increase in rental rates and an 111 or 42 million increase in reimbursements and ancillary and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 968 and total income per occupied home increased 35  to 2194 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 66 or 25 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations 

 

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 738 and 734 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

2017 vs 2016 

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2016 and held as of december 31 2017 consisted of 14840 apartment homes and provided 872 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2017 

noi for our samestore community properties increased 42 or 107 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 42 or 147 million increase in property rental income which was partial offset by a 44 or 40 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 30 or 99 million increase in rental rates and a 116 or 33 million increase in reimbursements and ancillary and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 967 and total income per occupied home increased 41 to 2114 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 100 or 31 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations 

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 735 for both years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 

nonmature communitiesother 

the operating partnership’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

2018 vs 2017 

the remaining 40 or 127 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2018 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 133 or 19 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 45 million from sold communities which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 25 million from stabilized nonmature communities 

2017 vs 2016 

the remaining 128 or 393 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2017 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 24 or 10 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 25 million from sold communities which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 12 million from acquired communities 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2018 real estate depreciation and amortization decreased by 59 or 90 million as compared to the same period in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to the sale of an operating community and a commercial office building in 2018 and fully depreciated assets 

for the year ended december 31 2017 real estate depreciation and amortization increased by 37 or 54 million as compared to 2016 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions during 2017 and homes delivered from our redevelopment property 

incomeloss in unconsolidated entities 

for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 435 million and 193 million respectively the increase in income from unconsolidated entities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the sale of an operating community held in the downreit partnership 

 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 193 million and 374 million respectively the decrease in loss from unconsolidated entities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a reduction in depreciation and amortization at the downreit partnership as a result of fully depreciated assets 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2018 interest expense decreased by 248 or 75 million as compared to 2017 which was primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of the prepayment of debt during the year ended december 31 2018 and higher prepayment penalties incurred during the year ended december 31 2017 

gainloss on sale of real estate owned 

during the year ended december 31 2018 the operating partnership recognized total gains of 755 million on the sale of an operating community in orange county california with a total of 264 apartment homes and a commercial office building in fairfax virginia 

during the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership sold two operating communities in orange county california and carlsbad california with a total of 218 apartment homes resulting in a gain of 413 million 

during the year ended december 31 2016 the operating partnership sold two operating communities in baltimore maryland with a total of 276 apartment homes resulting in a gain of 332 million 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2018 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

our strategic vision 

our strategic vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice we intend to realize this vision by executing on our strategic objectives which are 









maintaining a diversified portfolio and allocating capital to accretive investment opportunities 

we believe greater portfolio diversification as defined by geographic concentration location within a market ie urban or suburban and property quality ie a or b reduces the volatility of our samestore growth throughout the real estate cycle appeals to a wider renter and investor audience and lessens the market risk associated with owning a homogenous portfolio diversified characteristics of our portfolio include 



  



we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

acquisitions and dispositions 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider a wide variety of factors including 

















 









we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 











the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



  

the following table summarizes the operating partnership’s apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



aincludes 3107 homes deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the operating partnership to the downreit partnership 

development activities 

our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio demographic trends economic drivers and how multifamily fundamentals and valuations have trended over the longterm generally govern our review process on where to allocate development capital at december 31 2017 our development pipeline included two whollyowned communities located in huntington beach california and boston massachusetts with a total of 1101 homes and an aggregate budget of 7165 million in which we have a total carrying value of 5925 million 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during 2017 we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value during the year ended december 31 2017 we incurred 154 million in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings at december 31 2017 the company was not redeveloping any communities 

 

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

maintaining a strong balance sheet 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities 

consistently driving operational excellence 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal 

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction has improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic vision is the same as that of the company as described above 

competitive conditions 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 





 







moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

communities 

at december 31 2017 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities with a total of 39998 completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 53 communities with a total of 16698 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2017 the company was developing two whollyowned communities with 1101 apartment homes 300 of which have been completed the communities being developed are not part of the operating partnership’s real estate portfolio 

at december 31 2017 the company was not redeveloping any communities 

samestore community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2017 our samestore noi increased by 220 million compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 870 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in noi for the 35471 samestore apartment homes or 887 of our portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased by 107 million compared to the prior year the operating partnership’s samestore community properties provided 872 of its total noi for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in noi for the 14840 samestore apartment homes or 889 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was primarily driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes 

revenue growth in 2018 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain 

 

nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2017 

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

available information

 item 1arisk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 





















we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms furthermore because the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase 

 

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small andor local businesses may subject us to certain risks the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our retail or commercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the prior lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may adversely affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities among others 





competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks among others 







 









competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to acquire attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could materially adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks among others 















bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures as of december 31 2017 we had active joint ventures and partnerships including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investments with a total equity investment of 7208 million we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover our partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process 

we are also subject to other risks in connection with partnerships or joint ventures including i a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance however subject to certain conditions we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew or replace our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 



 







potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or 

 

more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders we are subject to federal state and local laws regulations rules and ordinances at locations where we operate regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or unanticipated reductions in revenue which could adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas should the impact of such climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death or injury due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death or injury of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we may originate mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than a senior mortgage secured by real property because the security for the loan may lose all or substantially all of its value as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our investment in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

risk related to preferred equity investments we may make preferred equity investments in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property with preferred equity investments our interest in a particular entity will be less than a majority of the outstanding ownership interests of that entity generally we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors managers general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives our partners may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests further if our partners were to fail to invest capital in the entity we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment our partners may fail to develop or operate the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all in addition we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent we may lose our entire investment in the entity 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

a breach of information technology systems on which we rely could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and reputation we rely on information technology systems including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors and other third parties to process transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes third party vendors collect and hold personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our tenants prospective tenants and employees we also maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons and entities with which we do business on our information technology systems while we take steps and generally require third party vendors to take steps to protect the security of the information maintained in our and third party vendors’ information technology systems including the use of commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide 

 

security for processing transmitting and storing of the information it is possible that our or our third party vendors’ security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the loss misappropriation disclosure or corruption of personally identifiable information or other confidential or sensitive information including information about our tenants and employees cybersecurity breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized access to information maintained on our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third party vendors or other third parties while we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cybersecurity breaches there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cybersecurity breach as the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems become more varied and sophisticated and the occurrence of such breaches becomes more frequent we and our third party vendors and other third parties may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques or breaches and implement appropriate preventative measures any failure to prevent cybersecurity breaches and maintain the proper function security and availability of our or our third party vendors’ and other third parties’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation and brand damage our competitive position make it difficult for us to attract and retain tenants subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of information technology system failures despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our information technology systems our information technology systems and the information technology systems maintained by our third party vendors are vulnerable to damage arising from any number of sources beyond our or our third party vendors’ control including energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures any failure to maintain proper function and availability of our or third party vendors’ information technology systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

social media presents risks the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation further employees or others may disclose nonpublic information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites which could adversely affect our business and results of operations as social media evolves we will be presented with new risks and challenges 

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the amounts under our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could 

 

create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow and increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient revenue to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the revenue generated by our apartment communities 



















expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt including unsecured commercial paper at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2017 udr had approximately 4805 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 130 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2017 the operating partnership had approximately 270 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 169 of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt including unsecured commercial paper accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties 

our debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit construction loans and other forms of secured debt commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated “high volatility commercial real estate” designation which has adversely impacted the availability of 

 

loans including construction loans and the proceeds of and the interest rate thereon restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of udr’s existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets moody’s and standard  poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt commercial paper program and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets including our ability to access the commercial paper market 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing such as the commercial paper market any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock 

a change in us government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the us have been suggested including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to provide limitations on the loans that the agencies may make which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us 

 

to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including for periods prior to 2018 any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates however under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 with respect to regular dividends dividends that are themselves neither capital gain dividends nor qualified dividend income we pay to our us stockholders that are not corporations 20 of such dividends may generally be included in the calculation of combined qualified business income for purposes of calculating the deduction available under section 199a of the code a provision due to expire after 2025 absent future legislation 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the 

 

recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results although the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 was recently passed there can be no assurance that future changes to the us federal income tax laws or regulatory changes will not be proposed or enacted that could impact our business and financial results the reit rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes if enacted certain of such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results moreover the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 contained provisions that may reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 lowered income tax rates on individuals and corporations easing the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and potentially causing the single level of taxation on reit distributions to be relatively less attractive the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 also contains provisions allowing the expensing of capital expenditures which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for reits and provisions further limiting the deductibility of interest expense which could disrupt the real estate market 

we cannot predict whether when or to what extent the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and any new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will impact the real estate investment industry or reits prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and potential future changes to the federal tax laws on an investment in our shares 

we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and local jurisdictions in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business we or our affiliates including entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to federal state or local tax audits if we or such entities become subject to federal state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the 

 

downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if either the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 





























 











many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

udr inc 

business overview 

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns operates acquires renovates develops redevelops disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include the operating partnership and the downreit partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures 

at december 31 2017 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127 communities in 11 states plus the district of columbia totaling 39998 apartment homes and our total real estate portfolio inclusive of our unconsolidated communities included an additional 29 communities with 7286 apartment homes 

at december 31 2017 the company was developing two whollyowned communities with a total of 1101 apartment homes 300 of which have been completed and two unconsolidated joint venture communities with a total of 533 apartment homes none of which have been completed the company was not redeveloping any communities as of december 31 2017 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr inc consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 274 million 244 million and 224 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated entities 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the 

 

fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2017 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 





 



we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2016 and held as of december 31 2017 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements and our unsecured commercial paper program will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities andor dispositions of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital to primary locations in markets we believe will provide the best investment returns 

capital expenditures 

we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

the above table includes amounts capitalized during the year actual capital spending is impacted by the net change in capital expenditure accruals 

we intend to continue to selectively add revenueenhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement

credit facilities and commercial paper program 

we have two secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 3149 million all of which was outstanding as of december 31 2017 the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from december 2018 through july 2020 and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2017 2858 million of the outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of 486 and the remaining balance of 290 million had a weighted average variable rate of 292 during the year ended december 31 2017 the company prepaid 2753 million of its secured credit facilities with borrowings under the company’s unsecured commercial paper program and proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured mediumterm notes 

the company has a 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and a 3500 million unsecured term loan facility the “term loan facility” the credit agreement for these facilities allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan facility to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2020 with two sixmonth extension options subject to certain conditions the term loan facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 29 2021 

based on the company’s current credit rating the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points and the term loan facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 95 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 85 to 155 basis points the facility fee ranges from 125 to 30 basis points and the margin under the term loan facility ranges from 90 to 175 basis points 

as of december 31 2017 we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility leaving 11 billion of unused capacity excluding 33 million of letters of credit at december 31 2017 and 3500 million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility 

we have a working capital credit facility which provides for a 75 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “working capital credit facility” with a scheduled maturity date of january 1 2019 based on the company’s current credit rating the working capital credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin ranges from 85 to 155 basis points in february 2018 we amended the working capital credit facility to extend the scheduled maturity date to january 2021 the maximum borrowing capacity and interest rate were unchanged by the amendment 

as of december 31 2017 we had 218 million of outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility leaving 532 million of unused capacity 

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank revolving credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations all of which were in compliance with at december 31 2017 

on january 23 2017 we entered into an unsecured commercial paper program under the terms of the program we may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of 500 million the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured indebtedness the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership as of december 31 2017 we had issued 3000 million of commercial paper for one month terms at a weighted average annualized rate of 196 leaving 2000 million of unused capacity 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these 

 

financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 4805 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2017 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 55 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost this analysis does not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 13 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders 

2017 vs 2016 

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders was 1179 million 044 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2890 million 108 per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year the decrease resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

2016 vs 2015 

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders was 2890 million 108 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to net income of 3367 million 129 per diluted share for the prior year the decrease resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 









this was partially offset by 



apartment community operations 

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc below 

 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands

noi for our samestore community properties increased 38 or 220 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 37 or 301 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 35 or 81 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 25 or 197 million increase in rental rates and a 112 or 74 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 968 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 35 to 2064 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 71 or 62 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 715 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 714 for the comparable period in 2016 

2016 vs 2015

noi for our samestore community properties increased 65 or 314 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 57 or 388 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 37 or 74 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 55 or 359 million increase in rental rates and a 65 or 36 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy was unchanged at 967 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 56 to 1958 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 92 or 65 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations and lower appeal refunds 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 713 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 708 for 2015 

nonmature communitiesother 

udr’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

2017 vs 2016 

the remaining 130 or 910 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2017 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother increased by 39 or 35 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to a 133 million increase in noi from stabilized nonmature communities a 58 million increase in noi from acquired communities and a 08 million increase in nonresidentialother noi partially offset by a 164 million decrease in noi from sold communities 

 

2016 vs 2015

joint venture management and other fees 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we recognized income from joint venture management and other fees of 114 million and 227 million respectively the decreased income in 2016 as compared to 2015 was attributable to the promote and fee income of 100 million recognized in connection with the sale of the texas joint venture in 2015 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2017 real estate depreciation and amortization increased 25 or 104 million as compared to 2016 the increase was primarily due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2017 and 2016 partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets 

for the year ended december 31 2016 real estate depreciation and amortization increased 120 or 450 million as compared to 2015 the increase was primarily due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2016 and 2015 partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets 

general and administrative 

for the year ended december 31 2016 general and administrative expense decreased 166 or 99 million from 2015 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and stockbased compensation expense for awards under the longterm incentive plan of 62 million primarily due to the departure of our prior chief financial officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015 a decrease in longterm incentive plan transition costs of 26 million and a decrease in acquisition costs of 19 million which was partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits 

incomeloss from unconsolidated entities 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 313 million and 522 million respectively the decrease of 209 million was primarily due to 





as compared to 



for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 522 million and 623 million respectively the decrease of 101 million was primarily due to 



 

as compared to 



interest expense 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we recognized interest expense of 1288 million and 1230 million respectively the increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 of 58 million was primarily due to the early pay off of secured debt during 2017 resulting in prepayment costs 

tax provisionbenefit net 

income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date 

the company recognized a tax provisionbenefit net of 03 million and 38 million for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

the decrease for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to the conversion of certain trs entities into reits in 2016 and a onetime tax benefit of 11 million related to the recording of previously reserved receivables for reit amt credits that became refundable under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 

gainloss on sale of real estate owned net of tax 

during the year ended december 31 2017 the company recognized a gain net of tax of 434 million on the sale of a parcel on land in richmond virginia and two operating communities in orange county california and carlsbad california

during the year ended december 31 2015 the company sold 12 operating communities with a total of 2735 apartment homes resulting in a gain net of tax of 2517 million 

noncontrolling interest 

for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we recognized net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and the downreit partnership of 109 million 273 million and 168 million respectively the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to the noncontrolling interest’s share of gains on sale associated with the dispositions made in 2016 the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to the number of partnership units held by thirdparty noncontrolling interest holders as a result of the formation of the downreit partnership in october 2015 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2017 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 dollars in thousands 











during 2017 we incurred gross interest costs of 1473 million of which 186 million was capitalized 

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock unvested ltip units stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count 

we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income 

 

and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs 

funds from operations as adjusted 

ffo as adjusted attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other noncomparable items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains or losses on sales of nondepreciable property and marketable securities deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal costs 

management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 

adjusted funds from operations 

adjusted ffo “affo” attributable to common stockholders and unitholders is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffo as adjusted 

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net incomeloss determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 05 million 08 million and 09 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated entities 

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms 

 

for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 





we report in two segments samestore communities and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2016 and held as of december 31 2017 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is 

 

cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings owed by us under the general partner’s credit agreements 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings owed by us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2017 the operating partnership does not have any secured debt maturing in 2018 

statements of cash flows 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided byused in operating activities  net cash provided byused in investing activities  and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided byused in operating activities was 2345 million compared to 2287 million for 2016 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved operating income primarily driven by revenue growth at communities 

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided byused in operating activities was 2287 million compared to 2268 million for 2015 the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved operating income primarily driven by revenue growth at communities 

investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided byused in investing activities was 1061 million compared to 95 million for 2016 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of an operating community partially offset by the disposition of two operating communities 

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided byused in investing activities was 95 million compared to 236 million for 2015 the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from dispositions partially offset by increased distributions received from unconsolidated entities and acquisitions of real estate assets in 2015 

acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership acquired an operating community located in denver colorado with a total of 218 apartment homes and 17000 square feet of retail space for a purchase price of approximately 1415 million the acquisition will be fully or partially funded with section 1031 exchanges 

the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2016 

in october 2015 the operating partnership acquired one community in alexandria virginia with 421 apartment homes for a purchase price of 1420 million 

 

dispositions

during the year ended december 31 2016 the operating partnership sold two operating communities in the baltimore maryland market with a total of 276 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 453 million resulting in net proceeds of 446 million and a gain net of tax of 332 million 

in connection with the formation of the downreit partnership in october 2015 the operating partnership contributed seven operating communities to the downreit partnership the operating partnership recorded its contribution to the downreit partnership at book value and consequently deferred a gain of 2964 million as a result of the contribution the operating partnership gave up its controlling interest and deconsolidated the seven operating communities the operating partnership accounts for its investment in the downreit partnership under the equity method of accounting 

during the year ended december 31 2015 the operating partnership sold five communities with a total of 1149 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 2509 million resulting in net proceeds of 2324 million and a gain net of tax of 1335 million a portion of the sale proceeds was designated for taxdeferred section 1031 exchanges for one of the october 2015 acquisitions from home op additionally the operating partnership recognized a gain of 246 million which was previously deferred in connection with the sale of the communities held by the texas joint venture 

financing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided byused in financing activities was 1288 million compared to 2215 million for 2016 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in advances from the general partner partially offset by the early repayment of debt maturing in december 2018 july 2020 and july 2023 

for the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided byused in financing activities was 2215 million compared to 2477 million for 2015 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in advances to the general partner and a decrease in payoffs of secured debt partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2017 an aggregate commitment of 1332 million of the general partner’s secured credit facilities with fannie mae was owed by the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt the entire commitment was outstanding at december 31 2017 the portions of the fannie mae credit facilities owed by the operating partnership mature at various dates from october 2019 through december 2019 and bear interest at fixed rates at december 31 2017 the entire outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of 528 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 11 billion an unsecured commercial paper program with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 500 million 300 million of mediumterm notes due october 2020 a 350 million term loan facility due january 2021 400 million of mediumterm notes due january 2022 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2024 300 million of mediumterm notes due october 2025 300 million of mediumterm notes due september 2026 300 million of mediumterm notes due july 2027 and 300 million of mediumterm notes due january 2028 as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the general partner did not have an outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility and had 3000 million and 0 respectively outstanding under its unsecured commercial paper program 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between 

 

changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 270 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2017 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 03 million based on the average balance at december 31 2017 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments owed by the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 8 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows  dollars in thousands  



  

  

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders 

2017 vs 2016 

net income attributable to op unitholders was 1063 million 058 per diluted op unit for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to net income of 778 million 042 per diluted op unit for the comparable period in the prior year the increase in net income attributable to op unitholders resulted primarily from the following items which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

net income attributable to op unitholders resulted primarily from the following items which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 







this was partially offset by 







apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi are property management costs which are the operating partnership’s allocable share of costs incurred by the general partner for shared services of corporate level property management employees and related support functions and costs 

management considers noi a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporatelevel expense allocations general and administrative costs capital structure and depreciation and amortization 

although we consider noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders below

noi for our samestore community properties increased 42 or 107 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 42 or 147 million increase in property rental income which was partial offset by a 44 or 40 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 30 or 99 million increase in rental rates and a 116 or 33 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 967 and total income per occupied home increased 41 to 2114 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 100 or 31 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations 

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 735 for both years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 

2016 vs 2015 

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2015 and held as of december 31 2016 consisted of 14001 apartment homes and provided 799 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2016 

noi for our samestore community properties increased 71 or 158 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 65 or 198 million increase in property rental income which was partial offset by a 49 or 40 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 66 or 190 million increase in rental rates physical occupancy decreased 02 to 966 and total income per occupied home increased 66 to 1989 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 2015 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 104 or 26 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations and lower appeal refunds 

the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 735 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 731 for 2015 

nonmature communitiesother 

the operating partnership’s nonmature communitiesother represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

2017 vs 2016 

the remaining 128 or 393 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2017 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 24 or 10 million for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 25 million from sold communities which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 12 million from acquired communities 

2016 vs 2015 

the remaining 201 or 596 million of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2016 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 378 or 363 million for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 2015 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 440 million from sold communities which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 85 million from stabilized nonmature communities 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2017 real estate depreciation and amortization increased by 37 or 54 million as compared to 2016 the increase was primarily due to acquisitions during 2017 and homes delivered from our redevelopment property 

for the year ended december 31 2016 real estate depreciation and amortization decreased by 134 or 227 million as compared to 2015 the decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the downreit partnership in october 2015 partially offset by homes delivered from our development and redevelopment properties 

 

general and administrative 

for the year ended december 31 2016 general and administrative expense decreased by 304 or 82 million as compared to 2015 the decrease was due to lower general and administrative expense allocations by the general partner primarily due to a decrease in its bonus expense and stockbased compensation expense for awards under its longterm incentive plan primarily due to the departure of its prior chief financial officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015 as well as lower allocations due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the downreit partnership in october 2015 

incomeloss in unconsolidated entities 

for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 incomeloss from unconsolidated entities was 193 million and 374 million respectively the decrease in loss from unconsolidated entities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a reduction in depreciation and amortization at the downreit partnership 

for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 374 million and 47 million respectively was attributable to the operating partnership’s ownership interest in the downreit partnership which was formed in october 2015 the change was primarily attributable to depreciation expense for a full year in 2016 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2016 interest expense decreased by 254 or 103 million as compared to 2015 which was primarily due to lower loan balances as a result of seven communities and their related debt being deconsolidated in october 2015 in connection with the formation of the downreit partnership 

gainloss on the sale of real estate owned 

during the year ended december 31 2017 the operating partnership sold two operating communities in orange county california and carlsbad california with a total of 218 apartment homes resulting in a gain of 413 million 

during the year ended december 31 2016 the operating partnership sold two operating communities in baltimore maryland with a total of 276 apartment homes resulting in a gain of 332 million 

during the year ended december 31 2015 the operating partnership sold five communities with a total of 1149 apartment homes resulting in a gain of 1335 million a portion of the sale proceeds was designated for a section 1031 exchange for one of the october 2015 acquisitions from home op additionally the operating partnership recognized a gain of 246 million which was previously deferred in connection with the sale of the communities held by the texas joint venture 

in connection with the formation of the downreit partnership in october 2015 the operating partnership contributed seven operating communities to the downreit partnership the operating partnership recorded its contribution to the downreit partnership at book value and consequently deferred a gain of 2964 million as a result of the contribution the operating partnership gave up its controlling interest and deconsolidated the seven operating communities the operating partnership accounts for its investment in the downreit partnership under the equity method of accounting 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of wage pressures and increases in utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have initial terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rental rates on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2017 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

general 

udr is a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns operates acquires renovates develops redevelops disposes of and manages multifamily apartment communities generally located in high barriertoentry markets throughout the united states the high barriertoentry markets are characterized by limited land for new construction difficult and lengthy entitlement processes low singlefamily home affordability and strong employment growth potential at december 31 2016  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127  communities located in 18  markets with a total of 39454  completed apartment homes which are held directly or through our subsidiaries including the operating partnership and the downreit partnership and consolidated joint ventures in addition we have an ownership interest in 27  communities containing 6849  apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships as of december 31 2016  the company was developing two  whollyowned communities with 1101  apartment homes none of which have been completed and four unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1069 apartment homes 99 of which have been completed

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to in this report as the “code” to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gains to our stockholders annually as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually in 2016  we declared total distributions of 118  per common share and paid dividends of 11625  per common share 



udr was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland the operating partnership is the successorininterest to united dominion realty lp a limited partnership formed under the laws of virginia which commenced operations in 1995 the operating partnership was redomiciled in 2004 as a delaware limited partnership our corporate offices are located at 1745 shea center drive suite 200 highlands ranch colorado and our telephone number is 720 2836120 our website is wwwudrcom  the information contained on our website including any information referred to in this report as being available on our website is not a part of or incorporated into this report 

as of february 17 2017  we had 1550 fulltime associates and 37 parttime associates all of whom were employed by udr 

reporting segments 

we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our s amestore communities  segment includes those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2015  and held as of december 31 2016  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the community is not classified as held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties for additional information regarding our operating segments see note 16 reportable segments  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report and note 11 reportable segments  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

business objectives 

our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 2016  highlights 

     refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information on the company’s and the operating partnership’s activities in 2016  

our strategies and vision 

our vision is to be the innovative multifamily public reit of choice our strategic priorities are 

1 strengthen the quality of our diversified portfolio 

2 flexiblestrong balance sheet 

3 increase cash flow to support dividend growth through operating excellence 

4 a great place to work and live 

quality of our diversified portfolio 

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

acquisitions and dispositions 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

 we regularly monitor our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

 the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our consolidated yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our yearend ownership position of the operating partnership for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



a includes 3107 homes deconsolidated in 2015 upon contribution of communities by the operating partnership to the downreit partnership 

development activities 

        our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio demographic trends economic drivers and how multifamily fundamentalsvaluations have trended over the longterm govern our review process on where to allocate development capital at december 31 2016  our development pipeline included two whollyowned communities located in huntington beach california and boston massachusetts with 1101  homes and a budget of 7085 million  in which we have a carrying value of 3423 million  

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during 2016  we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value at december 31 2016  the company was redeveloping 425  apartment homes 351  of which have been completed at three whollyowned communities located in san francisco california austin texas and dallas texas during the year ended december 31 2016  we incurred 213 million  in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings 

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

balance sheet management 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities 

operational excellence cash flow and dividend growth 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal 

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology as a result the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york new york san francisco bay area california boston massachusetts and metropolitan dc over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth household income low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing which are key drivers to strong rental growth 

competitive conditions 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

communities 

at december 31 2016  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127  communities with a total of 39454  completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 54  communities with a total of 16698  completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2016  the company was developing two whollyowned communities with 1101 apartment homes none of which have been completed the communities being developed are not part of the operating partnership’s real estate portfolio 

at december 31 2016  the company was redeveloping 425 apartment homes 351 of which have been completed at three whollyowned communities one of these communities under redevelopment is held by the operating partnership 

samestore community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’  noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property 

management our samestore community  population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2016  our samestore noi increase d by 314 million  compared to the prior year our samestore community  properties provided 769  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in noi for the 31930  samestore apartment homes or 809 of our portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2016  the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased by 158 million compared to the prior year the operating partnership’s samestore community  properties provided 799  of its total noi for the year ended december 31 2016  the increase in noi for the 14001  samestore apartment homes or 838 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates and a decrease in operating expenses 

revenue growth in 2017  may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2016  

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks 

involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets  unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire or the terms of renewals or new leases may be less favorable than current leases when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms furthermore because the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase 

  

we face certain risks related to our retail and commercial space certain of our properties include retail or commercial space that we lease to third parties the long term nature of our retail and commercial leases generally five to ten years with market based renewal options and the characteristics of many of our tenants generally small andor local businesses may subject us to certain risks the longer term leases could result in below market lease rates over time if we do not accurately judge the potential increases in market rental rates we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates also when leases for our retail or commercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the prior lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retail or commercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retail or commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility  we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities among others       

 competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents  our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies  we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks among others       



 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability  in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks among others       

 in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest  we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in partnerships and joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we currently have 16 active joint ventures and partnerships including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investment with a total equity investment of 8270 million  we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover our partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the partnership or joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process 

we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our partner including i a deadlock if we and our partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance however subject to certain conditions we retain the right to substitute other property or debt to meet these obligations to the sellers 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance  we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth  we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 



 potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs  under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation  when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs  the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders  we are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws and regulations regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change  certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas should the impact of such climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we may also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets  actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage lending secured by incomeproducing real property because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our 

initial expenditure in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

risk related to preferred equity investments in the future we may make preferred equity investments in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property with preferred equity investments our interest in a particular entity will be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity generally we will not have the ability to control the daily operations of the entity and we will not have the ability to select or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors managers general partner or partners or similar governing body of the entity or otherwise control its operations although we would seek to maintain sufficient influence over the entity to achieve our objectives the owner of the majority of the voting interests may have interests that differ from ours and may be in a position to take actions without our consent or that are inconsistent with our interests further if the owner of the majority of the voting interests were to fail to invest capital in the entity we may have to invest additional capital to protect our investment the owner of the majority of the voting interests may fail to develop or operate the real property in the manner intended and as a result the entity may not be able to redeem our investment or pay the return expected to us in a timely manner if at all in addition we may not be able to dispose of our investment in the entity in a timely manner or at the price at which we would want to divest in the event that such an entity fails to meet expectations or becomes insolvent we may lose our entire investment in the entity 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock  a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price  section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security  despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems and systems maintained by third party vendors are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet and networks and systems maintained and controlled by third party vendors to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and keeping of records which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing confidential tenant information such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we take steps and generally require third party vendors to take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our and their information systems it is possible that our or their security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our or third party vendors’ information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us 

social media presents risks the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or unintended information disclosure negative posts or communications about us on a social networking website could damage our reputation further employees or others may disclose nonpublic information regarding us or our business or otherwise make negative comments regarding us on social networking or other websites which could adversely affect our business and results of operations as social media evolves we will be presented with new and risks and challenges 

our success depends on our senior management  our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk  we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us and we may not be able to access the commercial paper market if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders  if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities  we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt including commercial paper at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2016  udr had approximately 4320 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 127  of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2016  the operating partnership had approximately 1906 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 438  of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date in addition borrowings under our commercial paper program bear interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt including commercial paper accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common and preferred stock and debt securities 

our debt level may be increased  our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive  our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit construction loans and other forms of secured debt commercial paper and other forms of unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time including due to regulatory changes directly or indirectly affecting financing markets for example the changes in terms on construction loans brought about by the basel iii capital requirements and the associated “high volatility commercial real estate” designation which has adversely impacted the availability of loans including construction loans and the interest rate thereon restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  moody’s and standard  poor’s routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt commercial paper program and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets including our ability to access the commercial paper market 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock  our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing such as the commercial paper market any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock 

a change in us government policy or support regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business while in recent years we have decreased our borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing to participants in the multifamily housing market including potential purchasers of our properties potential options for the future of agency mortgage financing in the us have been suggested including options that could involve a reduction in the amount of financing fannie mae and freddie mac are able to 

provide limitations on the loans that the agencies may make which may not include loans secured by properties like our properties or the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges  from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit  udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates  in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks  we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do 

not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash  as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction  from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain proposed tax reform measures could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results changes to the us federal income tax laws are proposed regularly legislative and regulatory changes may be more likely in the 115 th  congress because the presidency and such congress will be controlled by the same political party and significant reform of the code has been described publicly as a legislative priority additionally the reit rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations in addition to statutory changes if enacted certain such changes could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results for example certain proposals set forth in president trump’s administration and house republican tax plans could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit unless accompanied by responsive changes to the reit rules these proposals include the lowering of income tax rates on individuals and corporations which could ease the burden of double taxation on corporate dividends and make the single level of taxation on reit distributions relatively less attractive allowing the expensing of capital expenditures which could result in the bunching of taxable income and required distributions for reits and further limiting or eliminating the deductibility of interest expense which could disrupt the real estate market and could increase the amount of reit taxable income that must be distributed as dividends to shareholders 

we cannot predict whether when or to what extent new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be issued nor is the longterm impact of proposed tax reforms on the real estate investment industry or reits clear prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the us federal tax laws on an investment in our shares 

we may be adversely affected by changes in state and local tax laws and may become subject to tax audits from time to time  as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business we or our affiliates including entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to federal state or local tax audits if we or such entities become subject to federal state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify  the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation they would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code  our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock  the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 



 many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future  the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’  best interests  maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders  one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of 

such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

udr inc 

business overview 

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include the operating partnership and the downreit partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures 

at december 31 2016  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 127  communities in 10  states plus the district of columbia totaling 39454  apartment homes and our total real estate portfolio inclusive of our unconsolidated communities included an additional 27  communities with 6849  apartment homes

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation  amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were 244 million 224 million and 292 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated entities   

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2016  in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  



 

 

 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2015  and held as of december 31 2016  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities andor dispositions of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

on march 4 2016 the company sold 5000000 shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1737 million at a price per share of 3473 aggregate net proceeds from the sale after deducting the underwriting discount and offeringrelated expenses were approximately 1732 million  which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes

future capital needs 

future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities sales of properties joint ventures and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by property operations acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

  

during 2017  we have approximately 510 million  of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and no  unsecured debt maturing we anticipate repaying the debt with cash flow from our operations proceeds from debt or equity offerings proceeds from the dispositions of properties or from borrowings under our credit agreements

 credit facilities 

we had three secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 6368 million  all of which was outstanding as of december 31 2016  the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017  through july 2023  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2016 3558 million  of the outstanding balance was fixed and had a weighted average interest rate of 506  and the remaining balance of 2809 million  had a weighted average variable rate of 213  the company prepaid a portion of the secured credit facility due in may 2017  with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering in august 2016 

the company has a 11 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and a 3500 million  senior unsecured term loan facility the “term loan facility” the credit agreement for these facilities allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan facility to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion  subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2020 with two   six month extension options subject to certain conditions the term loan facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 29 2021 

based on the company’s current credit rating the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90  basis points and a facility fee of 15  basis points and the term loan facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 95  basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 85  to 155  basis points the facility fee ranges from 125  to 30  basis points and the margin under the term loan facility ranges from 90  to 175  basis points 

as of december 31 2016  we had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility leaving 11 billion  of unused capacity excluding 29 million  of letters of credit at december 31 2016  and 3500 million  of outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility 

we have a working capital credit facility which provides for a 75 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “working capital credit facility” with a scheduled maturity date of january 1 2019 based on the company’s current credit rating the working capital credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin ranges from 85 to 155 basis points 

as of december 31 2016  we had 214 million  of outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility leaving 537 million  of unused capacity 

  

in july 2016 we amended the working capital credit facility to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from 30 million  to 75 million  the scheduled maturity date and interest rate were unchanged by the amendment 

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

on january 23 2017 we entered into an unsecured commercial paper note program under the terms of the program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of 500 million  the notes are sold under customary terms in the united states commercial paper note market and rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership the company intends to use the commercial paper program as an alternative funding source for amounts that would have otherwise been outstanding on the revolving credit facility and intends to manage the use of the commercial paper program so that the maximum combined amount outstanding under the commercial paper program and the revolving credit facility will not exceed the maximum borrowings permitted under the credit facility of 11 billion  as of february 17 2017  we had issued 1200 million  of commercial paper notes for one month terms at a weighted average annualized rate of 116  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 4320  million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2016  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 65 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 14 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments

 apartment community operations 

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes 

several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc  below 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi which includes discontinued operations for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands

noi for our samestore community  properties increase d 65  or 314 million  for the year ended   december 31 2016  as compared to 2015  the increase  in property noi was primarily attributable to a 57 or 388 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 37 or 74 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 55 or 359 million increase in rental rates and a 65 or 36 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy was unchanged at 967 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 56 to 1958 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 92 or 65 million increase in real estate taxes which was primarily due to higher assessed valuations and lower appeal refunds 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increase d to 713  for the year ended   december 31 2016  as compared to 708  for 2015

noi for our samestore community  properties increased 295 million or 67 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 56 or 351 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 30 or 56 million increase in operating expenses the increase in property income was primarily driven by a 51 or 304 million increase in rental rates and a 65 or 29 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy was unchanged at 967 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 55 to 1721

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 711 for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 703 for 2014 

nonmature communitiesother 

udr’s nonmature communitiesother  represent those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities  which include communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for disposition properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

2016  vs 2015   

the remaining 1555 million  or 231  of our total noi for the year ended   december 31 2016  was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother   increase d by 217  or 278 million  for the year ended   december 31 2016  compared to 2015  the increase  was primarily driven by an increase  in noi of 410 million  from acquired communities and an increase of 112 million  from developed and redeveloped communities completed in 2016 and 2015 which was partially offset by a decrease in noi of 247 million  from communities sold or held for disposition in 2016 and 2015 

2015  vs 2014   

the remaining 1447 million  or 236 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2015 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother  noi from nonmature communitiesother  increased by 241 or 281 million for the 

year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 268 million from developed and redeveloped communities completed in 2015 and 2014 and 149 million from acquired communities which was partially offset by a decrease in noi of 191 million from communities sold or held for disposition in 2015 and 2014 

joint venture management and other fees 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized income from joint venture management and other fees of 114 million  227 million  and 130 million  respectively the decreased income in 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased income in 2015 as compared to 2014 was attributable to the promote and fee income of 100 million recognized in connection with the sale of the texas joint venture in 2015 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended   december 31 2016  real estate depreciation and amortization increase d 120  or 450 million  as compared to 2015  the increase  was primarily due to   homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2016 and 2015 partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets 

for the year ended december 31 2015  real estate depreciation and amortization increased 46 or 164 million as compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to   homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities and communities acquired in 2015 and 2014 partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets 

general and administrative 

for the year ended   december 31 2016  general and administrative expense decrease d 166  or 99 million  from 2015  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bonus expense and stockbased compensation expense for awards under the longterm incentive plan of 62 million primarily due to the departure of our prior chief financial officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015 a decrease in longterm incentive plan transition costs of 26 million and a decrease in acquisition costs of 19 million which was partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits 

for the year ended december 31 2015  general and administrative expense increased 249 or 119 million from 2014 the increase was primarily due to a 50 million increase in bonus expense a 46 million increase in stockbased compensation expense for awards under the longterm incentive plan of which 35 million was due to the transition from a oneyear to a threeyear performance period a 18 million increase in acquisitionrelated costs and an increase in salaries and benefits 

incomeloss from unconsolidated entities 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 522 million  623 million  and 70 million  respectively the decrease in income in 2016 as compared to 2015 of 101 million  was primarily due to the sale of three operating communities by the udrmetlife ii joint venture which resulted in gains of 477 million for the company and a casualty gain of 38 million as a result of insurance proceeds related to a september 2015 event received during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the sale of the eight communities held by the texas joint venture which resulted in a gain of 594 million  during the year ended december 31 2015 the increase in income in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the sale of the eight communities held by the texas joint venture 

interest expense 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized interest expense of 1230 million  1219 million  and 1305 million  respectively the decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 of 66 or 86 million was primarily due to the repayment of the 3252 million medium term notes in january 2015 and the replacement of debt at lower rates 

interest income and other incomeexpense net 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  interest income and other incomeexpense net  was 19 million  16 million  and 119 million  respectively the decrease in 2015 as compared to 2014 of 103 million  was primarily attributable to the net gain of 84 million realized on the repayment of a note receivable in 2014 

tax benefitprovision net 

income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date 

the company recognized a tax benefitprovision net  of 38 million  39 million  and 151 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the decrease for 2016 as compared to 2015  was primarily attributable to a onetime tax benefit of 24 million  related to the conversion of certain taxable reit subsidiary entities into reits in 2016 offset by an increase in noi of properties in the trs 

  

the decrease for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to a onetime tax benefit of 58 million related to the conversion of certain taxable reit subsidiary entities into reits in 2014 and the resulting zero effective tax rate being applied to its 2015 income 

gainloss on sale of real estate owned net of tax 

during the year ended december 31 2016 the company sold eight operating communities with a total of 1782 apartment homes a retail center and its 95 interest in two land parcels resulting in a gain net of tax of 2109 million

noncontrolling interest 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we recognized net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and the downreit partnership of 273 million  168 million  and 55 million  respectively the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to the number of partnership units held by thirdparty noncontrolling interest holders as a result of the formation of the downreit partnership in october 2015 the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of partnership units held by thirdparty noncontrolling interest holders as a result of the formation of the downreit partnership as well as increased net income of the operating partnership 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2016  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016   dollars in thousands 



 

 during 2016  we incurred gross interest costs of 1395 million of which 165 million was capitalized 

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of ffo diluted if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count 

activities of our taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” include development and land entitlement from time to time we develop and subsequently sell a trs property which results in a shortterm use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits we believe that the inclusion of these trs gains in ffo is consistent with the standards established by nareit as the shortterm investment is incidental to our main business trs gains on sales net of taxes are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation 

we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs 

funds from operations as adjusted 

ffo as adjusted is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other noncomparable items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains on sales of marketable securities and trs property deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal costs management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits 

ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders  is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 

adjusted funds from operations 

adjusted ffo “affo” is a nongaap financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance affo is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenditures on consolidated communities that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffo as adjusted 

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders  is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions 

the following table outlines our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders  to ffo ffo as adjusted and affo for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014   dollars in thousands

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation   amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were 08 million 09 million and 49 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated entities   

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of 

acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2016  

 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2015  and held as of december 31 2016  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not held for disposition at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2016  the operating partnership does not  have any secured debt maturing in 2017

operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2016  net cash provided byused in operating activities  was 2287 million  compared to 2268 million  for 2015  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved operating income primarily driven by revenue growth at communities

investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2016  net cash provided byused in investing activities  was 95 million  compared to 236 million  for 2015  the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from dispositions partially offset by increased distributions received from unconsolidated entities and acquisitions of real estate assets in 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net cash provided byused in investing activities  was 236 million  compared to 467 million  for 2014  the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily related to an increase in proceeds from dispositions and decreased spend on development projects partially offset by the acquisition of a real estate asset in 2015

financing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2016  net cash provided byused in financing activities  was 2215 million  compared to 2477 million  for 2015  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in advances to the general partner and a decrease in payoffs of secured debt partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net cash provided byused in financing activities  was 2477 million  compared to 1628 million  for 2014  the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in advances to the general partner 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2016  an aggregate commitment of 4085 million  of the general partners secured credit facilities with fannie mae was allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt the entire commitment was outstanding at december 31 2016  the portions of the fannie mae credit facilities allocated to the operating partnership mature at various dates from december 2018  through july 2023  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2016  2449 million  of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 505  and the remaining balance of 1636 million  on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of 232  

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 11 billion  300 million  of mediumterm notes due june 2018  300 million  of mediumterm notes due october 2020  a 350 million  term loan facility due january 2021  400 million  of mediumterm notes due january 2022  300 million  of mediumterm notes due july 2024  300 million  of mediumterm notes due october 2025  and 300 million  of mediumterm notes due september 2026  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility was 00  and 1500 million  respectively 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 1906 million  in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2016  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 19 million based on the balance at december 31 2016  

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 8 derivatives and hedging activity  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments

although the company considers noi a useful measure of a operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders  below

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2016  real estate depreciation and amortization decrease d by 134  or 227 million  as compared to 2015  the decrease  was primarily due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the downreit partnership in october 2015 partially offset by homes delivered from our development and redevelopment properties

for the year ended december 31 2016  general and administrative expense decrease d by 304  or 82 million  as compared to 2015  the decrease was due to lower general and administrative expense allocations by the general partner primarily due to a decrease in its bonus expense and stockbased compensation expense for awards under its longterm incentive plan primarily due to the departure of its prior chief financial officer in 2016 and outperformance in 2015 as well as lower allocations due to the deconsolidation of communities contributed to the downreit partnership in october 2015 

incomeloss in unconsolidated entities 

for the year ended december 31 2016  and 2015  incomeloss from unconsolidated entities of 374 million  and 47 million  respectively was attributable to the operating partnerships ownership interest in the downreit partnership which was formed in october 2015 the change was primarily attributable to depreciation expense for a full year in 2016

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs the majority of our apartment leases have terms of 12 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2016  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during 2015  we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value at december 31 2015  the company was redeveloping all 264  apartment homes 11  of which have been completed at two whollyowned communities located in san francisco california and bellevue washington the company also was redeveloping one whollyowned community in san francisco california with renovations to the building exterior corridors and common area amenities with no impact to individual homes during the year ended december 31 2015  we incurred 329 million  in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings 

joint venture and partnership activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

balance sheet management 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities 

operational excellence cash flow and dividend growth 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio using our webbased resident internet portal 

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

portfolio improvement 

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 695 of our consolidated samestore noi was generated by communities located in our primary markets of seattle washington san francisco bay area california los angeles california orange county california austin texas dallas texas boston massachusetts new york new york and metropolitan dc at december 31 2015  the company held 754 of its samestore carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our primary markets for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 731 of the operating partnership’s samestore noi was generated by communities located in our primary markets and 737 of its samestore carrying value of its real estate portfolio was generated in its primary markets 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology as a result the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york new york san francisco bay area california boston massachusetts and metropolitan dc over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing which are three key drivers to strong rental growth 

competitive conditions 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 7 

 moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

communities 

at december 31 2015  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 133  communities with a total of 40728  completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 57  communities with a total of 16974  completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2015  the company was developing one whollyowned community with 516 apartment homes none of which have been completed the community being developed is not part of the operating partnership’s real estate portfolio 

at december 31 2015  the company was redeveloping 264 apartment homes 11 of which have been completed at two whollyowned communities the company was also was redeveloping one whollyowned community with renovations to the building exterior corridors and common area amenities with no impact to individual homes two of these communities under redevelopment are held by the operating partnership 

samestore community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental and other operating expenses excluding property management our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2015  our samestore noi increase d by 295 million  compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 764 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2015  the increase in noi for the 33063 samestore apartment homes or 812 of our portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes utilities expense and personnel costs 

for the year ended december 31 2015  the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased by 82 million  compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 819  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2015  the increase in noi for the 14760  samestore apartment homes or 870 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates fee and reimbursement income increased occupancy and an decrease in operating expenses 

revenue growth in 2016  may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the general economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or 

local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2015  

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multi family apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets  unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses including mortgage payments generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or 

reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase 

substantial international national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations  the values of and the cash flows from the properties we own are affected by developments in global national and local economies as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions federal state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending tax increases public sector job losses increased interest rates currency devaluations or other adverse economic events which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility  we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities       

 competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents  our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies  we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks       

 11 

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability  in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks       

 in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest  we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we currently have 16 active joint ventures and partnerships including our participating loan investment and preferred equity investment with a total equity investment of 9389 million  we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process 

we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner including i a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we may not be permitted to dispose of certain properties or pay down the indebtedness associated with those properties when we might otherwise desire to do so without incurring additional costs in connection with certain property acquisitions we have agreed with the sellers that we will not dispose of the acquired properties or reduce the mortgage indebtedness on such properties for significant periods of time unless we pay certain of the resulting tax costs of the sellers and we may enter into similar agreements in connection with future property acquisitions these agreements could result in us retaining properties that we would otherwise sell or not paying down or refinancing indebtedness that we would otherwise pay down or refinance 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance  we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth  we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 13 

 potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs  under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation  when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs  the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from 

compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change  certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas should the impact of such climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets  actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage lending secured by incomeproducing real property because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of 

udr ’ s common stock  a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price  section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security  despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and keeping of records which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing confidential tenant information such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us 

our success depends on our senior management  our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations  the united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate change executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate 

governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations  we are subject to state and local laws regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities nor can we judge what impact if any the implementation of new legislation might have on our business 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk  we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders  if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 17 

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

our debt level may be increased  our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive  our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock  our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock 

a change in us government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business  fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities  we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2015  udr had approximately 6104 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 170  of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2015  the operating partnership had approximately 1972 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 412  of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common and preferred stock and debt securities 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges  from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit  udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as reits under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that any such subsidiary fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates  in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks  we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our 

taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash  as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction  from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws  as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships but cannot guarantee that they will qualify  the operating partnership and the downreit partnership intend to qualify as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and intend to take that position for all income tax reporting purposes if classified as partnerships the operating partnership and the downreit partnership generally will not be taxable entities and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership and the downreit partnership would be treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes if they were “publicly traded partnerships” unless at least 90 of their income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although neither the operating partnership’s nor the downreit partnership’s partnership units are traded on an established securities market because of the redemption rights of their limited partners the operating partnership’s and downreit partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership and the downreit partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership or the downreit partnership were to be taxed as a corporation they would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code  our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or 

impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock  the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 

 21 

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future  the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’  best interests  maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders  one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

business overview

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation  amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were 224 million 292 million and 405 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures   

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2015  in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2015  



 

 

 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2014  and held as of december 31 2015  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for sale at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities andor dispositions of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

future capital needs 

future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities sales of properties joint ventures and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by property operations acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

  

during 2016  we have approximately 1491 million  of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and 951 million  of unsecured debt maturing in january 2016 we paid off 833 million of 525 mediumterm notes due january 2016 with borrowings under the company’s 11 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we anticipate repaying the remaining debt with cash flow from our operations proceeds from debt or equity offerings proceeds from the dispositions of properties or from borrowings under our credit agreements 

statements of cash flow 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided byused in operating activities  net cash provided byused in investing activities  and net cash provided byused in financing activities  that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

operating activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  net cash provided byused in operating activities  was 4316 million  compared to 3924 million  for 2014  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved income from continuing operations primarily driven by revenue growth at the communities 

 for the year ended   december 31 2014  net cash provided byused in operating activities  was 3924 million  compared to 3399 million  for 2013  the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to improved income from continuing operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities 

investing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  net cash provided byused in investing activities  was 2384 million  compared to 2937 million  for 2014  the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to decreased spend on consolidated development projects partially offset by increased acquisitions of real estate capital expenditures and major improvements and issuances of notes receivable 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  net cash provided byused in investing activities  was 2937 million  compared to 1232 million  in 2013  the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to increased acquisitions of real estate and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of real estate lower spend on development and redevelopment and repayment of notes receivable 

acquisitions 

in october 2015 the company completed the acquisition of six washington dc area properties from home properties lp a new york limited partnership “home op” for a total contractual purchase price of 9006 million  which was comprised of 5648 million  of downreit units in the newly formed downreit partnership issued at 35  per unit a total of 161 million  units the assumption of 893 million  of debt 2210 million  of reverse section 1031 exchanges and 255 million  of cash in addition the company issued approximately 140 million  shares of its series f preferred stock to former limited partners of home op which had the right to subscribe for one share of series f preferred stock for each downreit unit issued in connection with the acquisitions for additional information regarding the downreit partnership see note 11 noncontrolling interests  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report 

of the six properties acquired from home op four were acquired through the downreit partnership one was acquired by the company through a reverse section 1031 exchange and one was acquired by the operating partnership through a reverse section 1031 exchange 

in february 2015 the company acquired an office building in highlands ranch colorado for total consideration of approximately 240 million  which was comprised of assumed debt the company’s corporate offices as well as other leased office space are located in the acquired building the building consists of approximately 120000  square feet all existing leases were assumed by the company at the time of the acquisition 

in 2014 the company acquired a fullyentitled land parcel for future development located in huntington beach california for 778 million two communities located in seattle washington and kirkland washington with a total of 358 apartment homes for 455 million and 752 million respectively and a land parcel for future development located in boston massachusetts for 322 million the four acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014 were accomplished through taxdeferred section 1031 exchanges 

the company did not acquire any real estate assets in 2013 

capital expenditures 

we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

for the year ended   december 31 2015  total capital expenditures of 1113 million  or 2818  per stabilized home which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations were spent on all of our communities excluding development and commercial properties as compared to 901 million  or 2274  per stabilized home for the prior year 

the increase  in total capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase  in revenueenhancing improvements of 1252  or 183 million  revenueenhancing improvements of 330 million  or 835  per home were spent for the year ended   december 31 2015  as compared to 146 million  or 370  per home for the prior year the increase  is primarily attributable to   capital expenditures related to kitchen and bath remodels and upgrades to common areas 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under developments and commercial properties for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014   dollars in thousands  

a average number of homes is calculated based on the number of stabilized homes outstanding at the end of each month a community’s homes are considered stabilized once 90 occupancy has been achieved for at least three consecutive months 

the above table reports amounts capitalized during the year actual capital spending is impacted by the net change in capital expenditure accruals 

we will continue to selectively add revenueenhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement 

real estate under development and redevelopment 

at december 31 2015  our development pipeline for one whollyowned community totaled 516  homes with a budget of 3420 million  in which we have a carrying value of 1241 million  the estimated completion date for this community is the first quarter of 2018 during 2015  we incurred 1032 million  for development costs a decrease of 1483 million  from our 2014  level of 2515 million  

the following whollyowned projects were under development or recently completed as of december 31 2015  dollars in thousands

b the number of apartment homes for the communities under development presented in the table above is based on the projected number of total homes as of december 31 2015  no  apartment homes had been completed in other udrmetlife development joint ventures 

 the company has a fixed price option to acquire wolff’s remaining interest in each community beginning one  year after completion if the options are exercised for all five  communities the company’s total price will be 5974 million  in the event the company does not exercise its options to purchase at least two  communities wolff will be entitled to earn a contingent disposition fee equal to 65  percent return on its implied equity in the communities not acquired wolff is providing certain guaranties and there are construction loans on all five  communities once completed the five  communities will contain 1533  homes

 the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended december 31 2014 

 the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended december 31 2013 

 credit facilities 

as of december 31 2015  we had secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 8138 million  all of which was outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017  through july 2023  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates the company had 5145 million  of the balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 523  and the remaining balance of 2994 million  had a weighted average variable rate of 171  

as of december 31 2015  the company had a 11 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and a 3500 million senior unsecured term loan facility the “term loan facility” the credit agreement includes an accordion feature that allows the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and the total borrowings under the term loan facility to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to 20 billion subject to certain conditions including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders the revolving credit facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 31 2020 with two sixmonth extension options subject to certain conditions the term loan facility has a scheduled maturity date of january 29 2021 

the credit agreement replaced i the company’s 900 million revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in december 2017 and ii the company’s 250 million term loan and the company’s 100 million term loan both due june 2018 

as of december 31 2015 based on the company’s current credit rating the revolving credit facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 90 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points and the term loan facility has an interest rate equal to libor plus a margin of 95 basis points depending on the company’s credit rating the margin under the revolving credit facility ranges from 85 to 155 basis points and the facility fee ranges from 125 to 30 basis points and the margin under the term loan facility ranges from 90 to 175 basis points

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 6104  million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2015  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 80 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 13 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments 

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of ffo diluted if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count 

activities of our taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” include development and land entitlement from time to time we develop and subsequently sell a trs property which results in a shortterm use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits we believe that the inclusion of these trs gains in ffo is consistent with the standards established by nareit as the shortterm investment is incidental to our main business trs gains on sales net of taxes are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation 

we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs 

funds from operations as adjusted 

ffo as adjusted is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other noncomparable items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains on sales of marketable securities and trs property deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal costs management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits 

ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders  is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 

adjusted funds from operations 

adjusted ffo “affo” is a nongaap financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance affo is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffo as adjusted 

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders  is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

 apartment community operations 

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc  below 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi which includes discontinued operations for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands

noi for our samestore community properties increase d 295 million  or 67  for the year ended   december 31 2015  compared to 2014  the increase  in property noi was attributable to a 56 or 351 million increase in property rental income   which was partially offset by a 30 or 56 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 51 or 304 million increase in rental rates and a 65 or 29 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy remained the same at 967 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 55 to 1721 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 29 or 18 million increase in real estate tax a 49 or 15 million increase in utilities expense and a 31 or 14 million increase in personnel costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increase d to 711  for the year ended   december 31 2015  as compared to 703  for 2014

noi for our samestore community properties increased 52 or 216 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 43 or 262 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 25 or 46 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 35 or 202 million increase in rental rates and a 49 or 22 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 06 to 967 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 38 to 1573 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 41 or 26 million increase in real estate tax caused by higher real estate valuations and a 155 or 13 million increase in insurance expense primarily caused by higher volume of small claims 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 699 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 693 for 2013

2014  vs 2013   

the remaining 1155 million  or 208 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2014 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother noi from nonmature communities increased by 218 or 207 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 4385 or 216 million from development communities and 258 or 93 million from redevelopment communities completed in 2014 and 2013 which was partially offset by a decrease in noi of 508 or 146 million from communities sold in 2014 and 2013 

joint venture management and other fees

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2015  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition to construction costs we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation   amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were 09 million 49 million and 84 million respectively 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2015  

 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2014  and held as of december 31 2015  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for sale at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2015  the operating partnership had approximately 305 million  of principal payments on secured debt maturing in 2016  we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows or proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the advances tofrom general partner

operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net cash provided byused in operating activities  was 2268 million  compared to 2080 million  for 2014  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved income from continuing operations primarily driven by revenue growth at the communities

financing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net cash provided byused in financing activities  was 2477 million  compared to 1628 million  for 2014  the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased advances to the general partner 

for the year ended december 31 2014  net cash provided byused in financing activities  was 1628 million  compared to 1453 million  for 2013  the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased advances to the general partner partially offset by decreased payments on secured debt and proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2015  an aggregate commitment of 4210 million  of the general partners secured credit facilities with fannie mae was allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt the entire commitment was outstanding at december 31 2015  the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017  through july 2023  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2015  2508 million  of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 508  and the remaining balance of 1702 million  on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of 190  during 2013 the general partner reallocated an additional 137 million  of the fannie mae credit facilities to the operating partnership

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 1966 million  in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2015  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 20 million based on the balance at december 31 2015  

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 9 derivatives and hedging activity  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments

2014  vs 2013    

net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders  was 962 million 053 per op unit for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 734 million 040 per op unit for the the prior year the increase resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

 this was partially offset by 

 

apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of a operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders  below 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total portfolio which includes discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013   dollars in thousands

the following table is our reconciliation of total property noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders  as reflected for both continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013   dollars in thousands  



samestore communities 

2015  vs 2014   

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2014  and held on december 31 2015  consisted of 14760  apartment homes and provided 819  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2015  

noi for our samestore community properties increase d 33  or 82 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2014  the increase  in property noi was primarily attributable to a 19 or 67 million increase in property rental income and by a 15 or 15 million decrease in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 15 or 52 million increase in rental rates and a 19 or 05 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 15  to 968  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2014  

the decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 51 or 08 million decrease in repair and maintenance expense a 14 or 05 million decrease in real estate tax expense and a 51 or 03 million decrease in marketing and administrative expenses 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 721  for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 712  for 2014  

2014  vs 2013   

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2013 and held on december 31 2014 consisted of 19010 apartment homes and provided 881 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2014 

noi for our samestore community properties increased 61 or 152 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 48 or 172 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 19 or 20 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 37 or 128 million increase in rental rates and a 40 or 11 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 954 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 46 to 1713 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 42 or 15 million increase in real estate tax caused by higher real estate valuations and a 187 or 08 million  increase in insurance expense primarily caused by a higher volume of small claims which was partially offset by a 23 or 04 million  decrease in repairs and maintenance costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 710 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 700 for 2013 

nonmature communitiesother 

2015  vs 2014   

the remaining 576 million  or 181  of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2015  was generated from our nonmature communitiesother the operating partnership’s nonmature communitiesother consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities which includes communities recently developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties noi from nonmature communitiesother increased 186  or 91 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2014  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 147  or 44 million  from redevelopment properties and an increase of 5622  or 34 million  in development properties 

2014  vs 2013   

the remaining 357 million or 119 of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2014 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 64 or 25 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 999 or 87 million from properties sold during 2014 and 2013 which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 272 or 12 million from commercialother properties and an increase of 413 or 42 million from redevelopment properties 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2015  real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decrease d by 52  or 94 million  as compared to 2014  the decrease  in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily due to sold communities and fully depreciated assets partially offset by homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities 

for the year ended december 31 2014 real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decreased by 12 or 21 million as compared to 2013 the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily from disposition of assets in 2014 and 2013 partially offset by the depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2014 and 2013

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2015  interest expense decrease d by 33  or 14 million  as compared to 2014  which was primarily due to lower amounts of outstanding debt during 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2014 interest expense increased by 157 or 57 million as compared to 2013 which was primarily due to lower portion of interest capitalized in 2014 as a result of completed developments partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to replacement of debt at lower rates 

gainloss on the sale of real estate owned 

during the year ended december 31 2015  the operating partnership sold five  communities with a total of 1149  apartment homes for gross proceeds of 2509 million  resulting in net proceeds of 2324 million  and a total gain net of tax of 1335 million  a portion of the sale proceeds was designated for a section 1031 exchange for one of the october 2015 acquisitions from home op additionally the operating partnership recognized a gain of 246 million  which was previously deferred in connection with the sale of the communities held by the texas joint venture 

in connection with the formation of the downreit partnership in october 2015 the operating partnership contributed seven operating communities to the downreit partnership the operating partnership recorded its contribution to the downreit partnership at book value and consequently deferred a gain of 2964 million  as a result of the contribution the operating partnership lost its controlling interest and deconsolidated the seven operating communities the operating partnership accounts for its investment in the downreit partnership under the equity method of accounting as described in note 5 unconsolidated entities  

for the year ended december 31 2014  the operating partnership sold one community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego california for gross proceeds of 487 million resulting in a 244 million gain and net proceeds of 479 million the operating partnership also recorded gains of 392 million in connection with udr’s sale of two communities in tampa florida and los angeles california which were previously deferred 

due to the operating partnership’s adoption asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  effective january 1 2014 these gains were included in gainloss on sale of real estate owned  on the operating partnership’s consolidated statements of operations see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 

for the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized gains on sale of depreciable property of 415 million these gains are included in incomeloss from discontinued operations on the operating partnership’s consolidated statements of operations included in this report changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

net incomeloss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2015  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 18 million  as compared to 10 million  for 2014  the increase of 08 million was primarily due to increased net income of the communities with noncontrolling interest 

for the year ended december 31 2014 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 10 million  as compared to 46 million for 2013 the decrease of 36 million was primarily due to the operating partnership correcting an error in the general partner’s ownership interest in one of the consolidated subsidiaries resulting in a cumulative adjustment recorded in 2013 of 33 million management believes the impact of the cumulative adjustment in 2013 is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2015  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our yearend ownership position of the operating partnership for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



development activities 

        our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio demographic trends economic drivers and how multifamily fundamentalsvaluations have trended over the longterm govern our review process on where to allocate development capital at december 31 2014 our development pipeline included one whollyowned community located in boston massachusetts with 369 homes and a budget of 2177 million in which we have a carrying value of 1776 million 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during 2014 we continued to redevelop properties in primary markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value at december 31 2014 the company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes 694 of which have been completed at one whollyowned community with 739 apartment homes located in new york new york during the year ended december 31 2014 we incurred 315 million  in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings 

joint venture activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type iii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

the operating partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above 

balance sheet management 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities 

operational excellence cash flow and dividend growth 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in january 2009 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week and complete online leasing applications and renewals throughout our portfolio 

we launched a new website at the end of 2014 this is the third major revision of udrcom and represents a complete rebuild of our online presence it was completed after several months of research with customer focus groups that told us what they wanted to see in an online shopping experience the new website features elements such as online appointment scheduling enhanced neighborhood information and comparison shopping tools all of which are available via any device the customer may choose to date we are exceeding our initial targets for the site by converting a higher than expected amount of traffic to community visits 

as a result of transforming our operations through technology residents’ satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

portfolio improvement 

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 650 of our samestore noi was generated by communities located in our primary markets of seattle washington san francisco bay area california los angeles california orange county california austin texas dallas texas boston massachusetts new york new york and metropolitan dc 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology as a result the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york new york san francisco bay area california boston massachusetts and metropolitan dc over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing which are three key drivers to strong rental growth 

markets and competitive conditions 

during the year ended december 31 2014  650 of our consolidated samestore noi was generated from apartment homes located in our primary markets at december 31 2014  the company held 707 of its samestore carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our primary markets during the year ended december 31 2014  729 of the operating partnership’s samestore noi was generated from apartment homes located in our primary markets at december 31 2014  the operating partnership held 761 of its samestore carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its primary markets we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition 

other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

communities 

at december 31 2014  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 139  communities with a total of 39851  completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 68  communities with a total of 20814  completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2014  the company was developing one  whollyowned community with 369  apartment homes none  of which have been completed in addition at december 31 2014 the company had three communities with 825 apartment homes which were completed but not yet stabilized 

at december 31 2014  the company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes 694 of which have been completed at one  whollyowned community with 739  apartment homes 

samestore community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our samestore community population is comprised of operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2014  our samestore noi increased  by 216 million  or 52  compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 792 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase  in noi for the 34581  samestore apartment homes or 868 of our portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates fee and reimbursement income and increased occupancy partially offset by an increase in real estate taxes and insurance expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2014  the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased  by 152 million  or 61  compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 881 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2014 the increase  in noi for the 19010  samestore apartment homes or 913 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates fee and reimbursement income and increased occupancy partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

revenue growth in 2015 may be impacted by adverse developments affecting the economy generally reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2014  

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not 

currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets  unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses including mortgage payments generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 9 

 we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase 

substantial international national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations  the values of and the cash flows from the properties we own are affected by developments in global national and local economies as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions federal state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending tax increases public sector job losses increased interest rates currency devaluations or other adverse economic events which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate faster than increases in our rental rates which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility  we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities       

 competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents  our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies  we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks       

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability  in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks       

 11 

in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest  we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we currently have 15 active joint ventures and partnerships excluding our participating loan investment with a total equity investment of 6555 million we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses in general we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process 

we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner including i a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance  we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted which could result in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth  we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 12 

 potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs  under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation  when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs  the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the americans with disabilities act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not 

know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

compliance with or changes in real estate tax and other laws could adversely affect our funds from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change  certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas should the impact of such climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death due to fire natural disasters or other hazards the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets  actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage lending secured by incomeproducing real property because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower 

bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock  a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price  section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security  despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and keeping of records which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing confidential tenant information such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us 

our success depends on our senior management  our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations  the united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate change executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the most recent economic recession these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and continue to require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are 

proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations  we are subject to state and local laws regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities nor can we judge what impact if any the implementation of new legislation might have on our business 

changes in us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states is in accordance with gaap which is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the fasb and the sec which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for us companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk  we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders  if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 16 

 expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

our debt level may be increased  our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive  our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in these factors and market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock  our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the global financial crisis and the economic recession that followed it the united states stock and credit markets experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on debt financings to widen considerably those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing any future disruptions or uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all which may negatively affect our business and the market price of udr’s common stock if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock 

a change in us government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business  fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities  we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2014 udr had approximately 5797  million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 161 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2014 the operating partnership had approximately 2198 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 236  of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common and preferred stock and debt securities 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges  from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit  udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be taxed as a reit under the code and are therefore subject to the same risks in the event that they fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates  in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us stockholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual stockholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks  we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash  as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction  from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws  as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership but cannot guarantee that it will qualify  the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr if classified as a partnership the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a “publicly traded partnership” unless at least 90 of the operating partnership’s income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although the operating partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market because of the redemption right the operating partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax 

liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code  our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock  the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 

 20 

 many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future  the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’  best interests  maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders  one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

business overview 

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include the operating partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures 

at december 31 2014  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 139  communities in 10 states plus the district of columbia totaling 39851  apartment homes and our total real estate portfolio inclusive of our unconsolidated communities included an additional 36  communities with 10055  apartment homes 

at december 31 2014  the company was developing one  whollyowned community with 369  apartment homes and three unconsolidated joint venture communities with 1018 apartment homes none of which have been completed in addition the company was redeveloping 708 apartment homes 694 of which have been completed at one  whollyowned community with 739  apartment homes 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation  amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 292 million 405 million and 364 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures   

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2014  in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2014  



 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2013 and held as of december 31 2014  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for sale at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities and dispositions of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

in april 2012 the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement which was amended in july 2014 under which the company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2014 the company sold 3410433 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1021 million at a weighted average price per share of 2995 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 23 million were approximately 998 million  which was primarily used to fund the companys steele creek participating loan investment as of december 31 2014 we had 16518567 shares of common stock available for sale under the april 2012 program 

future capital needs 

future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities sales of properties joint ventures and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by property operations acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures by the 

reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

  

during 2015  we have approximately 1966 million  of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and 3243 million  of unsecured debt maturing in january 2015 we paid off 3252 million of 525 mediumterm notes due january 2015 with borrowings under the company’s 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility we anticipate repaying the remaining debt with cash flow from our operations proceeds from debt or equity offerings proceeds from the dispositions of properties or from borrowings under our credit agreements

 credit facilities 

as of december 31 2014  we have secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 8343 million  all of which was outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017  through july 2023  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates the company has 5681 million  of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 512  and the remaining balance of 2662 million  on these facilities had at a weighted average variable rate of 160  at december 31 2014

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 5797  million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2014  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 69 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 13 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments 

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 and is comparable to ffo diluted in the accompanying reconciliation historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo op units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count 

activities of our trs include development and land entitlement from time to time we develop and subsequently sell a trs property which results in a shortterm use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits we believe that the inclusion of these trs gains in ffo is consistent with the standards established by nareit as the shortterm investment is incidental to our main business trs gains on sales net of taxes are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation 

we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs 

funds from operations as adjusted 

ffo as adjusted is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other noncomparable items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains on sales of marketable securities and trs property deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases casualtyrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal costs management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits 

ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net income attributable to udr inc is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 

adjusted funds from operations 

adjusted ffo or “affo” is a nongaap financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance affo is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffo as adjusted 

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net income attributable to udr inc is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined 

in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

 apartment community operations 

our net income results are primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of a operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr inc  below 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi which includes discontinued operations for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands

noi for our samestore community properties increased   52  or 216 million  for the year ended   december 31 2014  compared to 2013  the increase  in property noi was attributable to a 43 or 262 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 25 or 46 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 35 or 202 million increase in rental rates and a 49 or 22 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 06 to 967 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 38 to 1573 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 41 or 26 million increase in real estate tax caused by higher real estate valuations and a 155 or 13 million increase in insurance expense primarily caused by a higher volume of small claims 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased  to 699  for the year ended   december 31 2014  as compared to 693  for 2013

noi for our samestore community properties increased 60 or 239 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 49 or 287 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 26 or 48 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 40 or 227 million increase in rental rates and a 77 or 36 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 960 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 47 to 1488 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 67 or 39 million increase in real estate tax and a 46 or 20 million increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 42 or 13 million decrease in repair and maintenance expense 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 692 for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 685 for 2012

2013  vs 2012   

the remaining 895 million  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2013 was generated from our nonmature communitiesother noi from nonmature communities decreased  by 136  or 141 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 2012  the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 735  or 220 million  from communities 

sold in 2012 partially offset by an increase in noi of 15509  or 52 million  from development communities completed in 2013 and 2012 and an increase in noi of 71  or 30 million  from redeveloped communities completed in 2013 and 2012 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 49  or 167 million  as compared to 2013 the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily due to homes delivered from our development and redevelopment communities partially offset by a decrease from sold communities and fully depreciated assets

general and administrative 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  general and administrative expense increased 132  or 56 million  from 2013 the increase was primarily due to a 38 million increase in stockbased compensation expense under the longterm incentive plan and salary and benefit increases 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  general and administrative expense decreased 35 or 16 million from 2012 the decrease was primarily due to acquisition costs incurred in 2012 

interest expense 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  interest expense increased  by 35  or 44 million  as compared to 2013  the increase  in interest expense was primarily due lower capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities 

for the year ended december 31 2013  interest expense decreased 92 or 127 million as compared to 2012 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2014

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation   amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were 49 million 84 million and 58 million respectively 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2014  

 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2013  and held as of december 31 2014  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not classified as held for sale at year end a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother segment represents those communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities including but not limited to recently acquired developed and redeveloped communities and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2014  the operating partnership had approximately 1930 million  of principal payments on secured debt maturing in 2015  we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows or proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the advances tofrom general partner  

statements of cash flows 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided byused in operating activities  net cash provided byused in investing activities  and net cash provided byused in financing activities  that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

operating activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  net cash provided byused in operating activities  was 2080 million  compared to 2083 million  for 2013  the increase in cash flow due to improved income from continuing operations was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2013  net cash provided byused in operating activities  was 2083 million  compared to 2011 million  for 2012  the increase in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio and changes in operating assets and operating liabilities 

investing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  net cash provided byused in investing activities  was 467 million  compared to 640 million  for 2013  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to lower spend on development and redevelopment 

for the year ended december 31 2013  net cash provided byused in investing activities  was 640 million  compared to 43 million  for 2012  changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to acquisitions dispositions development redevelopment and capital expenditures 

disposition of investments 

during the year ended december 31 2014  the operating partnership sold one  community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego california for gross proceeds of 487 million  resulting in a 244 million  gain and net proceeds of 479

also in 2013 the operating partnership distributed the development property los alisos to the general partner as a capital distribution upon the distribution of the property the operating partnership redeemed 1002556  limited partnership units owned by udr and affiliated entities and reduced its receivable from the general partner by 537 million  resulting in a net capital reduction of 770 million  

in 2012 the operating partnership sold four communities with 1314 apartment homes for a gain of 511 million 

financing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2014  net cash provided byused in financing activities  was 1628 million  compared to 1453 million  for 2013  the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased advances to the general partner partially offset by decreased payments on secured debt and proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

for the year ended december 31 2013  net cash provided byused in financing activities  was 1453 million  compared to 2033 million  for 2012  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in payments on secured debt a decrease in advances from the general partner and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2014  an aggregate commitment of 5266 million  of the general partners secured credit facilities with fannie mae was allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt the entire commitment was outstanding at december 31 2014  the fannie mae credit facilities mature at various dates from may 2017  through july 2023  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2014  3338 million  of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 490  and the remaining balance of 1928 million  on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of 183  during 2013 the general partner reallocated an additional 137 million  of the fannie mae credit facilities to the operating partnership 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 900 million  250 million  of term notes due june 2018  100 million  of term notes due june 2018  300 million  of mediumterm notes due june 2018  300 million  of mediumterm notes due october 2020  400 million  of mediumterm notes due january 2022  and 300 million  of mediumterm notes due july 2024  as of december 31 2014  there were 1525 million  outstanding borrowings under the unsecured credit facility as of december 31 2013  there was no  outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 2198 million  in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2014  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100  basis points our interest expense would increase by 22 million  based on the balance at december 31 2014  

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to 

the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 8 derivatives and hedging activity  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments

apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from noi generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

although the company considers noi a useful measure of a operating performance noi should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap noi excludes several income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders  below

noi for our samestore community properties increased   61  or 152 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase  in property noi was primarily attributable to a 48  or 172 million   increase  in property rental income which was partially offset by a 19  or 20 million   increase  in operating expenses the increase  in revenues was primarily driven by a 37  or 128 million   increase  in rental rates and a 40  or 11 million   increase  in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 954  and total monthly income per occupied home increased  by 46 to 1713  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 42  or 15 million  increase in real estate tax caused by higher real estate valuations and a 187 or 810000 increase in insurance expense primarily caused by a higher volume of small claims which was partially offset by a 23  or 367000  decrease in repairs and maintenance costs

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the operating partnership recognized 22 million of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31 2012 of which 18 million were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in casualtyrelated recoveriescharges net  on the consolidated statements of operations and 400000 were related to rent that was not contractually receivable and were classified as a reduction to rental income  on the consolidated statements of operations the company estimates that it incurred an additional 21 million of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31 2013 as noted the company settled the hurricane sandy claims as of december 31 2013

during the year ended december 31 2014 the company recorded 541000  of casualtyrelated losses due to property damage incurred during an earthquake and a storm in california all of which are included in casualtyrelated recoveriescharges net  on the consolidated statements of operations 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2014  interest expense increased by 157  or 57 million  as compared to 2013  which was primarily due to lower portion of interest capitalized in 2014 as a result of completed developments partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to replacement of debt at lower rates 

for the year ended december 31 2013 interest expense decreased by 203 or 92 million as compared to 2012 which was primarily due to lower portion of interest capitalized in 2013 as a result of completed developments partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to replacement of debt at lower rates 

gainloss on the sale of real estate owned 

for the year ended december 31 2014  the operating partnership sold one  community and an adjacent parcel of land in san diego california for gross proceeds of 487 million  resulting in a 244 million  gain and net proceeds of 479 million  the operating partnership also recorded gains of 392 million  in connection with udr’s sale of two  communities in tampa florida and los angeles california which were previously deferred 

due to the company’s adoption asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  effective january 1 2014 these gains were included in gainloss on sale of real estate owned  on the operating partnership’s consolidated statements of operations see note 2 significant accounting policies  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information

net incomeloss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2014 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 952000  as compared to 46 million  for 2013 the decrease of 36 million was primarily due to the operating partnership correcting an error in the general partner’s ownership interest in one of the consolidated subsidiaries resulting in a cumulative adjustment recorded in 2013 of 33 million management believes the impact of the cumulative adjustment in 2013 is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment 

homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2014  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

the following table summarizes our apartment community acquisitions and dispositions and our yearend ownership position of the operating partnership for the past five years  dollars in thousands  



development activities 

        our objective in developing a community is to create value while improving the quality of our portfolio demographic trends economic drivers and how multifamily fundamentalsvaluations have trended over the longterm govern our review process on where to allocate development capital at december 31 2013 our development pipeline for six whollyowned communities located in san francisco california huntington beach california mission viejo california boston massachusetts college park maryland and alexandria virginia totaled 1765 homes 422 of which have been completed with a budget of 6976 million in which we have a carrying value of 4674 million 

redevelopment activities 

our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also producing a higher yielding and more valuable asset through asset quality improvement during 2013 we continued to redevelop properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value at december 31 2013 the company is redeveloping 1423 apartment homes 1008 of which have been completed at two whollyowned communities with 1670 apartment homes located in new york new york and costa mesa california the scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter the budget for our rivergate project in manhattan expanded due to the identification of further 

revenue generating opportunities while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 seventy five mesa verde project in orange county due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket during the year ended december 31 2013 we incurred 1127 million in major renovations which include major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings 

joint venture activities 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures including limited liability companies or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100 of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations including i the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land or a community ii our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market submarket and product type ii our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength and iv our projections in some circumstances that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate andor dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement 

the operating partnership is not a party to any of the joint venture activities described above 

balance sheet management 

we maintain a capital structure that we believe allows us to proactively source potential investment opportunities in the marketplace we have structured our debt maturity schedule to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt markets when appropriate 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to finance our activities we utilize proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt fund development and redevelopment activities and acquire apartment communities 

operational excellence cash flow and dividend growth 

investment in new technologies continues to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in january 2009 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week in july 2010 we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio as a result of transforming our operations through technology resident’s satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

in 2013 udr rolled out an online leasing platform that allows prospects to apply directly online as of december 31 2013 over 40 of our leases have been processed using online leasing we also focused heavily on conversion optimization of our traffic through udrcom which resulted in a 14 increase from the prior year 

portfolio improvement 

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 695 of our samestore net operating income “noi” was generated by communities located in our core markets of seattle washington san francisco bay area california los angeles california orange county california san diego california austin texas dallas texas boston massachusetts new york new york baltimore maryland and metropolitan dc 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology as a result the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york new york san francisco bay area 

california boston massachusetts and metropolitan dc markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing which are three key drivers to strong rental growth 

markets and competitive conditions 

during the year ended december 31 2013  695 of our consolidated samestore net operating income “noi” was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets at december 31 2013  the company held 745 of its samestore carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our core markets during the year ended december 31 2013  778 of the operating partnership’s samestore noi was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets at december 31 2013  the operating partnership held 811 of its samestore carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its core markets we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use rental concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties redevelop existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside 

communities 

at december 31 2013  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 141  communities with a total of 41250  completed apartment homes which included the operating partnership’s consolidated real estate portfolio of 68  communities with a total of 20746  completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2013  the company is developing six  whollyowned communities with 1765  apartment homes 422  of which have been completed of these six development communities the operating partnership is developing one whollyowned community totaling 332 homes none of which have been completed at december 31 2013  in addition at december 31 2013 the company had two communities with 731 apartment homes which were completed but not yet stabilized 

at december 31 2013  the company is redeveloping 1423 apartment homes 1008 of which have been completed at two  whollyowned communities with 1670  apartment homes the scope of the redevelopments at both projects changed in the fourth quarter the budget for our rivergate project in manhattan expanded due to the identification of further revenue generating opportunities while we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 seventy five mesa verde project in orange county due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket the operating partnership owns 27 seventy five mesa verde  

samestore community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our samestore communities’ noi which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our samestore community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2013  our samestore noi increased  by 239 million  or 60  compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 83 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase  in noi for the 35790  samestore apartment homes or 87 of our portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates fee and reimbursement income and increased occupancy partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2013  the operating partnership’s samestore noi increased  by 133 million  or 59  compared to the prior year our samestore community properties provided 84 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase  in noi for the 18616  samestore apartment homes or 90 of the operating partnership’s portfolio was driven by an increase in rental rates fee and reimbursement income and increased occupancy partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

revenue growth in 2014 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions new supply increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” re 3  to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of 14 months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2013  

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of 

the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that the environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets  unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels a downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses including mortgage payments and real estate taxes generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire when our residents decide to leave our apartments whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date we may not be able to relet their apartment units even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected if residents do not experience increases in their income we may be unable to increase rent andor delinquencies may increase 

continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the us economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  the us economy continues to experience 

some weakness following a severe recession including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending in addition while the federal reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following the recession such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy have emerged and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the economy is uncertain if the economic recovery slows or stalls or if the economy experiences another recession we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases demand for apartments may decline which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

substantial international national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations  the values of and the cash flows from the properties we own are affected by developments in global national and local economies as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions federal state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending tax increases public sector job losses increased interest rates currency devaluations or other adverse economic events which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that interest on our debt and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility  we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities       

 competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents  our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies  we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks       

 11 

 competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow or acquire properties profitably or with attractive returns 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability  in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks       

 in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result 

in services not being provided projects not being completed on time or on budget or at all or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest  we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures we currently have 10 active joint ventures and partnerships excluding our participating loan investment with a total equity investment of 4934 million we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process 

we are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner including i a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance  we have a comprehensive insurance program with limits of liability customary within the multifamily industry covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which are generally outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth  we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs  under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and 

remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation  when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs  the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

real estate tax and other laws  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing 

amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather and natural events and potential climate change  certain of our communities are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time including mudslides fires hurricanes tornadoes snow or ice storms or other severe inclement weather these adverse weather and natural events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

to the extent that we experience any significant changes in the climate in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather conditions and prolonged changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to andor a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas should the impact of such climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death due to fire natural disasters or other hazards   the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets  actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage lending secured by incomeproducing real property because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock  a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized 

cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price  section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or breaches in data security  despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and keeping of records which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing confidential tenant information such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us 

our success depends on our senior management  our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations  the united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate change executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and 

administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations  we are subject to state and local laws regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities nor can we judge what impact if any the implementation of new legislation might have on our business 

derivatives legislation adopted by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business  the doddfrank act regulates derivative transactions which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities the doddfrank act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and reits meeting certain criteria while we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions we cannot ensure we will qualify for them although the doddfrank act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted and fully implemented by both the sec and the commodities futures trading commission and market participants establish and operate registered clearing facilities under those regulations the doddfrank act provisions regarding derivatives and the implementing regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number andor creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us 

changes in the system for establishing us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations  accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board the “iasb” is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards “ifrs” ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation 

we are monitoring the sec’s activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted in addition switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs would be a complex undertaking we would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that would potentially be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards that could be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk  we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders  if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

our debt level may be increased  our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive  our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock  our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the past several years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets at times making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing the potential downgrade of the us’s credit rating and the european debt crisis recently contributed to instability in global credit markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our business additionally due to this uncertainty we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties 

on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of udr’s common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy 

a change in us government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business  fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities  we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2013 udr had approximately 4047  million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 115 of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2013 the operating partnership had approximately 1691 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 181  of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common and preferred stock and debt securities 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges  from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit  udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates  in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us shareholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks  we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash  as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction  from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws  as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but 

it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership but cannot guarantee that it will qualify  the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr if classified as a partnership the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a “publicly traded partnership” unless at least 90 of the operating partnership’s income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although the operating partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market because of the redemption right the operating partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code  our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock  the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 

 21 

 many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future  the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’  best interests  maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders  one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the 

person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the company ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation   

amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 405 million 364 million and 230 million respectively 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures   

we may enter into various joint venture agreements andor partnerships with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity method of accounting we determine whether to consolidate a joint venture or partnership based on our rights and obligations under the venture agreement applying the applicable accounting guidance the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture or partnership is complex and requires substantial management judgment we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs defined as level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2013 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2013  



 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2012 and held as of december 31 2013  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the communities are not held for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our  nonmature communitiesother  segment represents those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011 2012 or 2013 held for sale or sold properties redevelopment properties consolidated joint venture properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows sales of properties borrowings under our credit agreements andor the issuance of debt andor equity securities our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under our credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured revolving credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under our credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities andor the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by property operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities and dispositions of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

in april 2012 the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement under which the company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2013 no shares of common stock were sold under the april 2012 program as of december 31 2013 we had 19929000 shares of common stock available for sale under the april 2012 program 

future capital needs 

future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities sales of properties joint ventures and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by property operations acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

  

during 2014  we have approximately 480 million  of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and 3116 million  of unsecured debt maturing in january 2014 we paid off 184 million of 513 mediumterm notes due january 2014 with the borrowings under the company’s 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility we anticipate repaying the remaining debt with cash flow from our operations proceeds from debt or equity offerings proceeds from the dispositions of properties or from borrowings under our credit agreements

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial 

instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 4047  million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2013  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 55 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 13 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the udr consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivate instruments 

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of a reit’s operating performance in the computation of diluted ffo op units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count 

activities of taxable reit subsidiary “trs” re 3  include development and land entitlement from time to time we develop and subsequently sell a trs property which results in a shortterm use of funds that produces a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits we believe that the inclusion of these trs gains in ffo is consistent with the standards established by nareit as the shortterm investment is incidental to our main business trs gains on sales net of taxes are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation 

we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs 

funds from operations as adjusted 

ffo as adjusted is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other noncomparable items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains on sales of marketable securities and trs property deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases stormrelated expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal costs management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits 

ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net income attributable to udr inc is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity 

adjusted funds from operations 

adjusted ffo or “affo” is a nongaap financial measure that management uses as a supplemental measure of our performance affo is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain functionality at our communities therefore management considers affo a useful supplemental performance metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s operational performance than ffo or ffo as adjusted 

affo is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance we believe that net income attributable to udr inc is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to affo management believes that affo is a widely recognized measure of the operations of reits and presenting affo will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other reits however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not always be comparable to affo calculated by other reits affo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

net incomeloss attributable to common stockholders 

2013  vs 2012   

net income  attributable to common stockholders was 411 million   016  per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to net income  of 2034 million   085  per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year the decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2013  resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report

2012  vs 2011   

net income attributable to common stockholders was 2034 million 085 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to net income of 105 million 005 per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year the increase in net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2012 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

 

 

this was partially offset by 

 apartment community operations 

our net income results are primarily from net operating income “noi” generated from the operation of our apartment communities the company defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total property noi which includes discontinued operations for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 



a  samestore consists of 35790 apartment homes 

b  samestore consists of 33823 apartment homes 

c  excludes depreciation amortization and property management expenses 

the following table is our reconciliation of total property noi to net incomeloss attributable to udr  inc  as reflected for both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented  dollars in thousands 



same store communities 

          2013  vs 2012   

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2012  and held on december 31 2013  consisted of 35790  apartment homes and provided 83  of our total noi for the year ended   december 31 2013  

noi for our samestore community properties increased   60  or 239 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  the increase  in property noi was attributable to a 49 or 287 million increase in property rental income which was partially offset by a 26 or 48 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 40 or 227 million increase in rental rates and a 77 or 36 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 960 and total monthly income per occupied home increased by 47 to 1488 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 67 or 39 million increase in real estate tax and a 46 or 20 million increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 42 or 13 million decrease in repair and maintenance expense 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased  to 692  for the year ended   december 31 2013  as compared to 685  for the comparable period in 2012  

2012  vs 2011   

our same store community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2011 and held on december 31 2012 consisted of 33823 apartment homes and provided 70 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2012 

noi for our samestore community properties increased 66 or 216 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the increase in property noi was attributable to a 53 or 262 million increase in property rental income partially offset by a 28 or 45 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 46 or 221 million increase in rental rates and a 72 or 30 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 957 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 52 to 1331 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 90 or 44 million increase in real estate tax and a 45 or 12 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs which was partially offset by a 34 or 14 million decrease in personnel expense 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 679 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 671 for the comparable period in 2011 

nonmature communitiesother 

2013  vs 2012   

the remaining 895 million  or 17  of our total noi for the year ended   december 31 2013  was generated from our nonmature communitiesother udr’s nonmature communitiesother consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for sale properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased  by 136  or 141 million  for the year ended   december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 735  or 220 million  from communities sold in 2012 partially offset by an increase in noi of 52 million from development communities completed in 2012 and 2013 an increase in noi of 155  or 26 million  from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012 and an increase in noi of 71  or 30 million  from communities redeveloped in 2012 and 2013 

2012  vs 2011   

the remaining 1535 million  and 1557 million  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively was generated from our nonmature communitiesother noi from nonmature communities decreased  by 14  or 22 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 706  or 475 million  from communities sold in 2012 and 2011 partially offset by an increase in noi of 938  or 294 million  from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012 and an increase in noi of 313  or 113 million  from redeveloped communities completed in 2012 and 2011 in addition during the year ended december 31 2012 a 23 million increase to noi was recognized to reflect the establishment of a receivable from former residents previously written off at moveout 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased   25  or 89 million  as compared to the comparable period in 2012 the decrease  in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 and intangible assets related to in place leases acquired in 2011 and 2012 becoming fully amortized in 2012 the decrease was partially offset by the depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2012 and 2013 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 54 or 199 million as compared to the comparable periods in 2011  the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended   december 31 2012  was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 the decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to the acquisition of operating communities in 2012 and 2011 and depreciation from developed and redeveloped units placed in service in 2011 and 2012 

general and administrative 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  general and administrative expense decreased  35 or 16 million from the comparable period in 2012 the decrease was primarily due to acquisition costs incurred in 2012 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  general and administrative expense decreased 73 or 35 million from the comparable period in 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower acquisition costs of 25 million in 2012 which was attributable to less acquisition activity in 2012 as compared to 2011 

interest expense 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  interest expense decreased  by 92  or 127 million  as compared to the comparable period in 2012  the decrease  in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities 

for the year ended december 31 2012  interest expense decreased 112 or 176 million as compared to 2011 this decrease in interest expense was primarily due to early debt extinguishment during the year ended december 31 2012 and the write off of 40 million of deferred financing cost related to the prepayment of debt in 2011 

tax benefit net 

udr elected for re 3  to be treated as a trs income taxes for re 3  are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date 

the company recognized an income tax benefit from re 3  of 83 million and 211 million and an income tax expense of 76 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively included in 2012 is an income tax benefit of 437 million from re 3  which resulted from the reversal of a net deferred tax asset valuation allowance prior to 2012 re 3  had a history of losses and as a result had historically recognized a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets each quarter the company evaluates the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2012 the company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets including any remaining net operating losses will be realized in making this determination the company analyzed among other things its recent history of earnings forecasts of future earnings from sales of depreciable property and its cumulative earnings for the last twelve quarters 

hurricanerelated recoveriescharges net 

in october 2012 hurricane sandy hit the east coast affecting three  of the company’s operating communities  1706  apartment homes located in new york city the properties suffered some physical damage and were closed to residents for a period following the hurricane the company has insurance policies that provide coverage for property damage and business interruption subject to applicable retention 

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the company recognized a 90 million  impairment charge for the damaged assets’ net book value and incurred 104 million  of repair and cleanup costs during the year ended december 31 2012 the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were reduced as of december 31 2012  by 145 million  of estimated insurance recovery and were classified in hurricanerelated recoveriescharges ne t on the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december 31 2013  no  material adjustments to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were recognized with the exception of one of the properties that is under redevelopment at december 31 2013  the rehabilitation of the remaining two properties was substantially completed as of december 31 2013 

as of december 31 2013 the company had settled the hurricane sandy claims and received insurance proceeds in excess of the 145 million  estimated insurance recovery receivable related to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred as a result the company recognized a hurricanerelated recovery of approximately 48 million  and a casualty gain of approximately 654000  for the year ended december 31 2013 both the recovery and casualty gain were classified in hurricanerelated recoveriescharges ne t on the consolidated statements of operations 

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the company recognized 44 million  of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31 2012 of which 36 million  were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in hurricanerelated recoveriescharges ne t on the consolidated statements of operations and 767000  were related to rent that was not contractually receivable and were classified as a reduction to  rental income  on the consolidated statements of operations as noted below the company recovered from the insurance carrier approximately 42 million of the 44 million of 2012 business interruption losses the company estimates that it incurred an additional 34 million  of business interruption losses for the year ended   december 31 2013  as noted below the company recovered from the insurance carrier approximately 26 million of the 34 million of 2013 business interruption losses 

during the year ended december 31 2013 the company received approximately 68 million  of insurance proceeds for recovery of business interruption losses of the 68 million  of insurance proceeds received in 2013 42 million  related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2012 and the remaining 26 million  related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2013 the 68 million  of recovery was classified in hurricanerelated recoveriescharges ne t on the consolidated statements of operations as of december 31 2013  

incomeloss from unconsolidated entities 

for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we recognized losses from unconsolidated entities of 415000 86 million and 64 million respectively these losses relate to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships and are included in incomeloss from unconsolidated entities on the udr consolidated statements of operations included in this report the decrease in loss in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to an 83 million gain 53 million net of tax expense on the sale of our 95 interest in the lodge at stoughton 

net gainloss on the sale of depreciable properties 

for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we recognized gains before tax of 419 million  2604 million  and 1385 million  respectively these gains are included in incomeloss from discontinued operations net of tax 

on the consolidated statements of operations of udr included in this report changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2013  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013   dollars in thousands 



 

 during 2013  we incurred gross interest costs of 1555 million of which 294 million  was capitalized 

united dominion realty lp 

business overview

udr is a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities the general partner was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from virginia to maryland in september 2003 at december 31 2013  the general partner’s consolidated real estate portfolio included 141  communities located in 10  states and the district of columbia with a total of 41250  apartment homes in addition the general partner had an ownership interest in 37  communities with 9909  completed apartment homes through unconsolidated operating communities 

at december 31 2013 the operating partnership is developing one whollyowned community with 332 apartment homes none of which have been completed 

at december 31 2013 the operating partnership is redeveloping 748 apartment homes 629 of which have been completed at one whollyowned community with 964 apartment homes the scope of the redevelopment project changed in the fourth quarter we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 seventy five mesa verde project in orange county due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required a discussion of our significant accounting policies including further discussion of the accounting policies described below can be found in note 2 significant accounting policies  to the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report 

cost capitalization 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

in addition we capitalize costs directly related to the predevelopment development and redevelopment of a capital project which include but are not limited to interest real estate taxes insurance and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects we use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred these costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use as each home in a capital 

project is completed and becomes available for leaseup the operating partnership ceases capitalization on the related portion the costs capitalized are reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total real estate owned net of accumulated depreciation  amounts capitalized during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 84 million 58 million and 40 million respectively 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates operating costs growth rates discount rates capitalization rates industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize various sources including independent appraisals our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

summary of real estate portfolio by geographic market 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2013  

 we report in two segments samestore communities  and nonmature communitiesother  

our samestore communities  segment represents those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2012  and held as of december 31 2013  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and 

the communities are not held for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months 

our nonmature communitiesother  segment represents those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011 2012 or 2013 sold properties redevelopment properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt or unsecured debt sales of properties borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2013  the operating partnership had approximately 89 million  of principal payments on secured debt maturing in 2014  we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows or proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the payablereceivable due tofrom general partner

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by  operating activities net cash provided byused in investing activities and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  

operating activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  net cash flow provided by  operating activities was 2083 million  compared to 2011 million  for the comparable period in 2012  the increase in  net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to improved income from continuing operations offset by changes in operating assets and operating liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2012  net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2011 million compared to 1561 million for the comparable period in 2011  the increase in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio and changes in operating assets and operating liabilities 

investing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  net cash provided byused in investing activities was 640 million  compared to 43 million  for the comparable period in 2012  the change was primarily due to the increase in development and redevelopment activities and a decrease in dispositions changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to dispositions development redevelopment and capital expenditures 

for the year ended december 31 2012  net cash provided byused in investing activities was 43 million  compared to 2270 million  for the comparable period in 2011  changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to acquisitions dispositions development redevelopment and capital expenditures 

acquisitions 

the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013  and 2012 during the year ended december 31 2011 the operating partnership acquired four communities with 1833 apartment homes for 7612 million 

real estate under development and redevelopment 

at december 31 2013  the operating partnership was developing one whollyowned community that totaled 332 homes none of which have been completed with a budget of 1320 million in which we had a carrying value of 801 million the estimated completion date for this community will be through the third quarter of 2014 

at december 31 2013  the operating partnership was redeveloping 748 apartment homes 629 of which have been completed at one whollyowned community with 964 apartment homes the scope of the redevelopment project changed in the fourth quarter we tabled for the foreseeable future additional home interior renovations at our 27 seventy five mesa verde project in orange county due to lower than expected demand in that particular submarket the estimated completion date for this community will be through the second quarter of 2014 

 the following whollyowned projects were under development and redevelopment as of december 31 2013  dollars in thousands  



a formerly known as the calvert 

b formerly known as pine brook village i  ii and villa venetia these communities were combined in 2013 

c of the 964 apartment homes 748 are scheduled for redevelopment 

disposition of investments 

 in 2013 the operating partnership sold two  apartment communities in the sacramento market consisting of 914  apartment homes for gross proceeds of 811 million the operating partnership recognized a gain of 415 million  which is included in incomeloss from discontinued operations  on the operating partnership’s consolidated statements of operations included in this report proceeds were used primarily to fund development and redevelopment activity and reduce debt 

also in 2013 the operating partnership distributed the development property los alisos to the general partner as a capital distribution upon the distribution of the property the operating partnership redeemed 1002556  limited partnership units owned by udr and affiliated entities and reduced its receivable from the general partner by 537 million  resulting in a net capital reduction of 770 million  

in 2012 the operating partnership sold four communities with 1314 apartment homes for a gain of 511 million 

in 2011 the operating partnership sold eight communities with 2024 apartment homes which included four communities with 984 homes sold in conjunction with an asset exchange for a gain of 601 million 

financing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2013  our net cash provided byused in financing activities was 1453 million  compared to 2033 million  for the comparable period of 2012  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was 

primarily due to a decrease in payments on secured debt a decrease in advances from the general partner and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

for the year ended december 31 2012 our net cash providedused in by financing activities was 2033 million compared to net cash provided byused in financing activities of 707 million for 2011 the change in cash provided byused in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments on secured debt and a decrease in advances from the general partner partially offset by proceeds from issuance of secured debt 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2013  the general partner had secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 8381 million  with 8381 million  outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for terms of seven to ten years  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2013  6267 million  of the funded balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 499  and the remaining balance of 2114 million on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 161  in 2013 the general partner reallocated an additional 137 million  of the fannie mae credit facilities to the operating partnership at december 31 2013  there was a total of 5211 million  of these credit facilities allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 900 million  250 million  of term notes due june 2018  100 million  of term notes due june 2018  300 million  of mediumterm notes due june 2018  300 million  of mediumterm notes due october 2020  and 400 million  of mediumterm notes due january 2022  as of december 31 2013  there was no outstanding borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility as of december 31 2012  the outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility was 760 million  

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 1691 million  in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2013  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100  basis points our interest expense would increase by 17 million  based on the balance at december 31 2013  

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner also utilizes derivative financial instruments allocated to the operating partnership to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 8 derivatives and hedging activity  in the notes to the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of derivative instruments

 this was partially offset by 

 

apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from net operating income “noi” generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total portfolio which includes discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011   dollars in thousands

samestore communities 

2013  vs 2012   

our samestore community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2012  and held on december 31 2013  consisted of 18616  apartment homes and provided 84  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2013  

noi for our samestore community properties increased   59  or 133 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012 the increase  in property noi was primarily attributable to a 51  or 166 million   increase  in property rental income which was partially offset by a 33  or 33 million   increase  in operating expenses the increase  in revenues was primarily driven by a 43  or 137 million   increase  in rental rates and a 68  or 18 million   increase  in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 02 to 958  and total monthly income per occupied home increased  by 48 to 1609  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 70  or 23 million  increase in real estate tax and a 52  or 12 million  increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 31  or 502000  decrease in repairs and maintenance costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 700  for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to 695  for the comparable period in 2012  

2012  vs 2011

noi for our samestore community properties increased 65 or 124 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 55 or 153 million increase in property rental income partially offset by a 32 or 29 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 52 or 140 million increase in rental rates and a 77 or 19 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy remained the same at 954 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 55 to 1439 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 72 or 21 million increase in real estate tax and a 65 or 906000 increase in repairs and maintenance costs partially offset by a 22 or 474000 decrease in personnel costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 688 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 681 for the comparable period in 2011 

nonmature communitiesother 

2013  vs 2012   

the remaining 463 million  or 16  of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2013  was generated from our nonmature communitiesother the operating partnership’s nonmature communitiesother consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in samestore communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for sale properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties noi from nonmature communitiesother decreased 137  or 73 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to the same period in 2012  the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 458  or 47 million  from properties sold during 2013  and 2012  a decrease in noi of 243  or 22 million  from commercialother properties and a decrease of 62  or 12 million  from redevelopment properties 

2012  vs 2011   

the remaining 789 million  or 28 of our noi during the year ended december 31 2012  was generated from our nonmature communitiesother noi from nonmature communitiesother increased 65 or 48 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 764 or 172 million from communities acquired in 2011 and an increase of 144 or 32 million from redevelopment properties including communities completed in 2012 the increase in noi was partially offset by a decrease in noi of 779 or 159 million from properties sold during 2012 and 2011 during the year ended december 31 2012 a 12 million increase to noi was recognized to reflect the establishment of a receivable from former residents previously written off at move out 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2013  real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decreased  by 70  or 137 million  as compared to the comparable period in 2012  the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily from the disposition of assets in 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2012 real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decreased  by 15  or 29 million  as compared to the comparable period in 2011 the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily the result of acquisitions in 2011 and dispositions of assets in 2011 and 2012 as part of the operating partnership’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price was attributable to the fair value of intangible assets which are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

hurricanerelated recoveriescharges net 

in october 2012 hurricane sandy hit the east coast affecting two  of the operating partnership’s operating communities  1001  apartment homes located in new york city the properties suffered some physical damage and were closed to residents for a period following the hurricane the operating partnership has insurance policies that provide coverage for property damage and business interruption subject to applicable retention 

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the operating partnership recognized a 71 million  impairment charge for the damaged assets’ net book value and incurred 70 million  of repair and cleanup costs during the year ended december 31 2012 the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were reduced as of december 31 2012 by 108 million  of estimated insurance recovery and were classified in hurricane related recoveriescharges net  on the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended   december 31 2013  no  material adjustments to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred were recognized the rehabilitation of these two  properties was substantially completed as of december 31 2013 

as of december 31 2013  the operating partnership had settled the hurricane sandy claims and received insurance proceeds in excess of the 108 million  estimated insurance recovery receivable related to the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred as a result the company recognized a hurricanerelated recovery of approximately 33 million  and a casualty gain of approximately 582000  for the year ended   december 31 2013  both the recovery and casualty gain were classified in hurricane related recoveriescharges net  on the consolidated statements of operations 

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the operating partnership recognized 22 million  of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31 2012 of which 18 million  were related to rent concession rebates provided to residents during the period the properties were uninhabitable and were classified in hurricanerelated recoveriescharges net  on the consolidated statements of operations and 400000  were related to rent that was not contractually receivable and were classified as a reduction to rental income  on the consolidated statements of operations the company estimates that it incurred an additional 21 million  of business interruption losses for the year ended   december 31 2013  as noted the company settled the hurricane sandy claims as of december 31 2013  

during the year ended   december 31 2013  the operating partnership received approximately 42 million  of insurance proceeds for recovery of business interruption losses of the 42 million  of insurance proceeds received during the year ended   december 31 2013  21 million  related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2012 and the remaining 21 million  related to recovery of business interruption losses incurred in 2013 the 42 million  of recovery was included in hurricanerelated recoveriescharges net  on the operating partnership’s consolidated statements of operations included in this report 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2013  interest expense decreased  by 203  or 92 million  as compared to the same period in 2012  which was primarily due to lower average debt balances and lower average interest rates and higher capitalized interest from development and redevelopment activities 

for the year ended december 31 2012 interest expense decreased  by 157 or 84 million as compared to the same period in 2011 which was primarily due to lower debt balances from the pay off of certain fixed rate mortgage notes payable and lower average borrowings on secured credit facilities and an increase in capitalized interest due to increased development and redevelopment activity 

net gainloss on the sale of depreciable properties 

for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we recognized gains on sale of depreciable property of 415 million 511 million and 601 million respectively these gains are included in incomeloss from discontinued operations on the operating partnership’s consolidated statements of operations included in this report changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

net incomeloss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

for the year ended december 31 2013 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 46 million as compared to 352000 for the comparable period in 2012 the increase of 42 million was primarily due to the operating partnership correcting an error in the general partner’s ownership interest in one of the consolidated subsidiaries resulting in a cumulative adjustment recorded in 2013 of 33 million management believes the impact of the cumulative adjustment in 2013 is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2013  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material

 operational excellence cash flow and dividend growth 

investment in new technologies continue to drive operating efficiencies in our business and help us to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in january 2009 our residents have been utilizing our webbased resident internet portal on our website our residents have the ability to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week in july 2010 we completed the roll out of online leasing renewals throughout our portfolio as a result of transforming our operations through technology resident’s satisfaction improved and our operating teams have become more efficient webbased technologies have also resulted in declining marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and better pricing management of our available apartment homes 

in 2012  udrcom features and functionality were enhanced to increase a user’s engagement and search capability improvements included a new responsive website new photography enhancements to the online web forms and improved layout of the individual udr community homepages we also overhauled our mobile applications these overall enhancements have increased our web visitor traffic yearoveryear to almost 36 million visitors in 2012 up 16 with mobile traffic at 11 million visitors up 121 

portfolio improvement 

we are focused on increasing our presence in markets with favorable job formation high propensity to rent low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio investment decisions consider internal analyses and thirdparty research 

for the year ended december 31 2012  approximately 633 of our same store net operating income “noi” was generated by communities located in our core markets of seattle washington san francisco bay area california los angeles california orange county california san diego california austin texas dallas texas boston massachusetts baltimore maryland and washington dc 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology as a result the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york new york san francisco bay area california boston massachusetts and washington dc markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing which are three key drivers to strong rental growth 

markets and competitive conditions 

during the year ended december 31 2012  633 of our consolidated same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets of seattle washington san francisco bay area california los angeles california orange county california san diego california austin texas dallas texas boston massachusetts baltimore maryland and washington dc at december 31 2012  the company held 714 of its carrying value of its real estate portfolio in our core markets during the year ended december 31 2012  663 of the operating partnership’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in our core markets of seattle washington san francisco bay area california los angeles california orange county california san diego california austin texas dallas texas baltimore maryland and washington dc at december 31 2012  the operating partnership held 810 of its carrying value of its real estate portfolio in its core markets we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 moving forward we will continue to optimize lease management improve expense control increase resident retention efforts and align employee incentive plans with our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational upside in spite of a weak economic environment 

communities 

at december 31 2012  our apartment portfolio included 145  consolidated communities having a total of 41571  completed apartment homes and an additional 2622  apartment homes under development which included the operating partnership’s apartment portfolio of 72  consolidated communities having a total of 21660  completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb such rents 

at december 31 2012  the company is developing eight  whollyowned communities with 2622  apartment homes 76  of which have been completed of these eight development communities the operating partnership is developing two whollyowned communities totaling 652 homes none of which have been completed at december 31 2012  

at december 31 2012  the company is redeveloping four  whollyowned communities with 2253  apartment homes 602  of which have been completed of these four redevelopment communities the operating partnership is redeveloping two whollyowned communities with 964 apartment homes of which 121 have been completed at december 31 2012  

same store community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store communities’ net operating income “noi” which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2012  our same store noi increased  by 216 million  or 66  compared to the prior year the increase  in noi for the 33823  apartment homes or 70  of our portfolio which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates fee and reimbursement income and increased occupancy partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

for the year ended december 31 2012  the operating partnership’s same store noi increased  by 124 million  or 65  compared to the prior year the increase  in noi for the 17880  apartment homes or 72  of the operating partnerships portfolio which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

revenue growth in 2013 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize our trs to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions our trs generally is taxable as a regular corporation and therefore subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their 

ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2012  

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the multifamily apartment industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets  unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels the downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses including mortgage payments and real estate taxes generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the us economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  the us economy continues to experience some weakness following a severe recession including relatively high levels of unemployment and weak consumer spending if the economic recovery slows or stalls or if the economy experiences another recession we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to risks relating to the housing market recovery that has accompanied the economic recovery to the extent that when demand for single family homes increases demand for apartments may decline which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

substantial international national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations  the values of and the cash flows from the properties we own are affected by developments in global national and local economies as a result of the most recent recession and the significant government interventions federal state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending tax increases public sector job losses increased interest rates currency devaluations or other adverse economic events which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the general risk of inflation is that our debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties high unemployment may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our rental revenues 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility  we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities       

 competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents  our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies  we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks       

 15 

competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect our ability to grow 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability  in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks       

 in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

bankruptcy or defaults of our counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and from time to time we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties such as general contractors engaged in connection with our development activities as a result bankruptcies or defaults by these counterparties could result in services not being provided or volatility in the financial markets and economic weakness could affect the counterparties’ ability to complete transactions with us as intended both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest  we have in the past and may in the future develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures if we use such a structure we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest also our joint venture partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses frequently we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partners’ interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of 

our interest in the joint venture if we are the seller or of the other partner’s interest in the joint venture if we are the buyer at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm’s length marketing process 

we also are also subject to risk in cases where an institutional owner is our joint venture partner including i a deadlock if we and our joint venture partner are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions ii the limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the joint venture without the consent of the other joint venture partner and iii the requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance  we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth  we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs  under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future 

contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation  when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs  the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

real estate tax and other laws  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather events  certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of mudslides and fires and others where there are hurricanes tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

risk of earthquake damage some of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults we cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it in management’s view economically impractical 

risk of accidental death due to fire natural disasters or other hazards   the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets  actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

mezzanine loan assets involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by incomeproducing properties we may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property mezzanine loans may involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage lending secured by incomeproducing real property because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender and because it is in second position and there may not be adequate equity in the property in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt as a result we may not recover some of or all our initial expenditure in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr ’ s common stock  a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr ’ s stock price  section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures  despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and keeping of records which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing confidential tenant information such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or 

the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us 

our success depends on our senior management  our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by new federal laws and regulations  the united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate change executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

federal rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we may be adversely affected by new state and local laws and regulations  we are subject to state and local laws regulations and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect directly or indirectly our operations we cannot predict what matters might be considered in the future by these state and local authorities nor can we judge what impact if any the implementation of new legislation might have on our business 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business  the doddfrank act regulates derivative transactions which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities the doddfrank act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk and reits meeting certain criteria while we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions we cannot ensure we will qualify for them although the doddfrank act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted and fully implemented by both the sec and the commodities futures trading commission and market participants establish registered clearing facilities under those regulations the new legislation and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number andor creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us 

changes in the system for establishing us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations  accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial 

accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board the “iasb” is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards “ifrs” ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation 

we are monitoring the sec’s activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted in addition switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs would be a complex undertaking we would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that would potentially be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards that could be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk  we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders  if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 21 

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

our debt level may be increased  our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive  our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets  moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt and preferred stock these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr ’ s stock  our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the past few years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing the potential downgrade of the us’s credit rating and the european debt crisis have contributed to instability in global credit markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our business additionally due to this uncertainty we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of udr’s common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy 

a change in us government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business  fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency the administration has proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not 

possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities  we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2012 udr had approximately 4545  million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 133 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2012 the operating partnership had approximately 2016 million  of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 208  of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common and preferred stock and debt securities 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges  from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit  udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates  in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us shareholders is 20 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks  we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash  as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction  from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws  as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership but cannot guarantee that it will qualify  the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr if classified as a partnership the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a “publicly traded partnership” unless at least 90 of the operating partnership’s income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although the operating partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market because of the redemption right the operating partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax 

liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code  our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr ’ s common stock  the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 

 25 

 many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr ’ s common stock in the future  the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr ’ s stockholders ’  best interests  maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr ’ s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr ’ s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr ’ s stockholders  one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

business overview 

we are a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include an operating partnership united dominion realty lp a delaware limited partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc its subsidiaries and its consolidated joint ventures 

at december 31 2012  our consolidated real estate portfolio included 145  communities with 41571  apartment homes and our total real estate portfolio inclusive of our unconsolidated communities included an additional 39  communities with 9558  apartment homes

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  



 38 

we report in two segments same communities and nonmatureother communities our same communities segment includes those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2011  and held as of december 31 2012  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the community is not held for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months our nonmatureother communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011 or 2012 sold properties redevelopment properties consolidated joint venture properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt and equity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements the issuance of debt or equity securities and disposition of properties 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance

in march 2011 the company entered into an equity distribution agreement under which the company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock over time to or through its sales agents in september 2011 the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement in connection with filing a new registration statement on form s3 the new equity distribution agreement replaced the march 2011 agreement and no material changes were made to the equity distribution agreement on april 4 2012 the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement under which the company could offer and sell up to 20 million shares of its common stock from time to time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2012 we sold all of the remaining 8640969 shares of common stock through these programs for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 2221 million at a weighted average price per share of 2518 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 45 million were approximately 2176 million and were used to fund development and redevelopment activities for working capital and for general corporate purposes 

on may 31 2012 the company completed the redemption of all outstanding shares of its 675 series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock a total of 3264362 shares of the series g preferred stock were redeemed at a redemption price of 25 per share in cash plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date for a total cost of 821 million 

on june 4 2012 the company closed a public offering of 19000000 shares of its common stock in addition to 2850000 shares sold as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option in full at the closing at a price of 2570 per share for gross proceeds of approximately 5615 million and net proceeds of approximately 5388 million after underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses proceeds from the sale of shares through this offering were used to repay approximately 3639 million of the company’s 33 weighted average interest rate secured debt with various maturities from 2012  2014 to redeem all of its outstanding series g preferred stock to repay a portion of indebtedness outstanding under its unsecured credit facility and the balance for working capital and general corporate 

purposes 

future capital needs 

future development and redevelopment expenditures may be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities the sale of properties and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

during 2013  we have approximately 504 million  of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and 1215 million  of unsecured debt maturing we anticipate repaying that debt with cash flow from our operations and debt and equity offerings 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

capital expenditures 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

total capital expenditures which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations of 1573 million  or 3576  per stabilized home were spent on all of our communities excluding development and commercial properties for the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to 819 million  or 1706  per home for the comparable period in prior year 

the increase in total capital expenditures was primarily due to 

 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in total recurring capital expenditures total recurring capital expenditures of 422 million  or 960  per stabilized home were spent for the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to 446 million  or 928  per stabilized home for the comparable period in the prior year which was primarily due to a 104  or 33 million  decrease in asset preservation expenditures 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development and commercial properties for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  



we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital our objective in redeveloping a community is twofold we aim to meaningfully grow rental rates while also achieving cap rate compression through asset quality improvement recurring capital expenditures during 2013  are projected to be approximately 1020  per home 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures   

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the equity method to account for investments that qualify as variable interest entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and entities that we do not control or where we do not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee throughout our financial statements and in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use the term “joint venture” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100 ownership interest the company also uses the equity method when we function as the managing member and our joint venture partner has substantive participating rights or where we can be replaced by our joint venture partner as managing member without cause for a joint venture accounted for under the equity method our share of net earnings or losses is reflected as incomeloss when earnedincurred and distributions are credited against our investment in the joint venture as received 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

in october 2012 hurricane sandy hit the east coast affecting three of the company’s operating communities 1706 apartment homes located in new york city the properties suffered some physical damage and based on management’s estimates the company recognized a 90 million  impairment charge for the damaged assets’ net book value during the year ended december 31 2012  see note 15 hurricane related charges  of udr’s consolidated financial statements for additional information 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2012  in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

statements of cash flow 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities and net cash used inprovided by financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  

operating activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  our net cash flow provided by  operating activities was 3173 million  compared to 2442 million  for the comparable period in 2011  the increase in  cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio and changes in operating assets and operating liabilities 

 for the year ended   december 31 2011  our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2442 million  compared to 2142 million  for 2010  the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio which was partially offset by the increase in operating assets and a decrease in operating liabilities 

investing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  net cash used in  investing activities was 2094 million  compared to 11 billion  for the comparable period in 2011  the decrease in  net cash used for investing activities was due to changes in the level of investment activities which reflect our strategy as it relates to our investments in joint ventures acquisitions dispositions 

capital expenditures and development activities all of which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

for the year ended   december 31 2011  net cash used in investing activities was 11 billion  compared to net cash used in investing activities of 5838 million  for 2010  the change relates to acquisitions of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

acquisitions 

during the year ended   december 31 2012  the company acquired the remaining 80  ownership interests in two  apartment communities  633  homes located in austin texas for 117 million  from its joint venture partner 

in addition the company also acquired two parcels of land for development in san francisco california and boston massachusetts for a total purchase price of 772 million these land parcels were originally acquired as part of our investment in two development joint ventures see additional information under “consolidated joint ventures” of this section 

for the year ended   december 31 2011  the company acquired eight apartment communities located in new york new york boston massachusetts washington dc and san francisco california for a total gross purchase price of 15 billion during the same period the company also acquired land located in huntington beach california addison texas and boston massachusetts for a gross purchase price of 343 million

financing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  our net cash used inprovided by  financing activities was 1083 million  compared to 8120 million  for the comparable period of 2011  

the following significant financing activities occurred during the year ended   december 31 2012  

 

 

 

   

 

 credit facilities 

as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we have secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 9313 million  with 8425 million  outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years maturing at various dates from may 2017 through december 2019 and bear interest at floating and fixed rates we have 6311 million  of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 511  and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 207  at december 31 2012  we had 7445 million  of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 514  and 3105 million  was at a weighted average variable rate of 163  as of december 31 2011  

as of december 31 2012  we have a 900 million  unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in october 2015 the credit facility has a oneyear extension option and contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the facility to 135 billion based on the company’s current credit ratings the credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 1225 basis points and a facility fee of 225 basis points as of december 31 2012  we had 760 million  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility leaving 824 million  of unused capacity excluding 39 million  of letters of credit as of december 31 2011  we had 421 million  of borrowing outstanding under the credit facility leaving 479 million  of unused capacity excluding 36 million  of letters of credit 

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 4545  million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2012  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 66 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analysis do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the company also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 12 derivatives and hedging activities  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivate instruments 

funds from operations funds from operations as adjusted and adjusted funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or “gaap” excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” definition issued in april 2002 we consider ffo a useful metric for investors as we use ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures during the year ended december 31 2012  udr chose to exclude from the calculation of ffo a onetime tax benefit of 215 million  from trs and a tax provision of 66 million  associated with a gain on the sale of properties from the trs the benefit related to the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance has been excluded from ffo due to its nonrecurring nature the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count 

activities of our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” re 3 include development and land entitlement trs tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before 

accumulated depreciation to determine whether gains from the trs will be included in ffo the company considers whether the operating asset has been a short term investment we consider ffo with the trs recurring tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes and any related valuation allowance release to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

ffo as adjusted is defined as ffo excluding the impact of acquisitionrelated costs and other nonrecurring items including but not limited to prepayment costsbenefits associated with early debt retirement gains on sales of marketable securities and taxable reit subsidiary property stormrelated expenses severance costs and legal costs 

adjusted ffo or “affo” is defined as ffo as adjusted less recurring capital expenses  management considers affo a useful metric for investors as it is more indicative of the company’s recurring operational cash flow than ffo or ffo as adjusted 

the following table outlines our reconciliation of net incomeloss attributable to udr inc to ffo ffo as adjusted and affo for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010   dollars in thousands 



the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010    shares in thousands 



ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows  dollars in thousands  



results of operations 

the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented

our same store community properties those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2011  and held on december 31 2012  consisted of 33823  apartment homes and provided 70  of our total noi for the year ended   december 31 2012  

noi for our same store community properties increased   66  or 216 million  for the year ended   december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the increase  in property noi was attributable to a 53 or 262 million increase in property rental income and a 28 or 45 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 46 or 221 million increase in rental rates and a 72 or 30 million increase in reimbursement and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 957 and total monthly income per occupied home increased 66 to 1331 

the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by a 90 or 44 million increase in real estate tax and a 45 or 12 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs which was partially offset by a 34 or 14 million decrease in personnel expense 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased  to 679  for the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to 671  for the comparable period in 2011

noi for our same community properties increased 55 or 159 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 42 or 183 million increase in property rental income which was offset by a 17 or 25 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 41 or 172 million increase in rental rates and a 119 or 38 million increase in fee and reimbursement income which was offset by a 134 or 21 million increase in vacancy loss physical occupancy decreased 02 to 956 and total income per occupied home increased 52 to 1239 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 68 or 16 million increase in utilities expense a 19 or 885000 increase in taxes and a 37 or 284000 increase in insurance costs which was partially offset by a 17 or 632000 decrease in personnel cost 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 671 as compared to 663 in the comparable period in the prior year 

nonmatureother communities 

2012  vs 2011   

the remaining 1535 million  or 30  of our total noi during the year ended   december 31 2012  was generated from our “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties noi from nonmature communities decreased  by 14  or 22 million  for the year ended   december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in noi of 706  or 475 million  from communities sold in 2012 and 2011 which was partially offset by an increase in noi of 938  or 294 million  from communities acquired in 2011 and an increase in noi of 313  or 113 million  from communities redeveloped in 2012 and 2011 during the year ended december 31 2012 a 23 million increase to noi was recognized to reflect the establishment of a receivable from former residents previously written off at moveout 

2011  vs 2010   

the remaining 1776 million  and 1198 million  of our noi during the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties held for sale properties sold properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties noi from nonmature communities increased  by 483  or 578 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 4957  or 414 million  from communities acquired in 2011  and 2010 and an increase in noi of 590  or 140 million  from redeveloped communities in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in noi of 92  or 68 million  from communities sold in 2011

during the year ended   december 31 2011  real estate and amortization attributable to both continuing and discontinued operations increased 220 or 669 million as compared to the comparable periods in 2010  the increase  in depreciation and amortization for the year ended   december 31 2011  is primarily the result of the company’s acquisition of eight communities 3161 apartment homes during 2011 development and redevelopment activity during 2011 and 2010 and additional capital expenditures as part of the company’s acquisition activity in 2011 a portion of the purchase price was attributable to the fair value of intangible assets which were typically amortized over a period of less than one year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was also attributable to amortization expense related to in place leases acquired in 2011 

interest expense 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  interest expense attributable to both continuing and discontinued operations decreased   123  or 195 million  as compared to the comparable period in 2011  the decrease  in interest expense was primarily due to early debt extinguishment during the year ended   december 31 2012  and the write off of 40 million of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of debt in 2011 

for the year ended december 31 2011  interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 50 or 75 million as compared to 2010 this increase in interest expense was primarily due to slightly higher debt balances the increase was also attributable to the write off of 46 million of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of debt 

tax benefit of taxable reit subsidiary 

udr elected for re 3  to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date 

prior to 2012 the trs had a history of losses and as a result had historically recognized a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets each quarter the company evaluates the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets during the year ended   december 31 2012  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets including any remaining net operating losses will be realized in making this determination the company analyzed among other things its recent history of earnings forecasts of future earnings from the sale of depreciable property and its cumulative earnings for the last twelve quarters for the year ended   december 31 2012  the company recognized an income tax benefit from re 3  of 211 million  net which primarily resulted from the reversal of a net deferred tax asset valuation allowance of 215 million

to the extent that insurance proceeds ultimately exceed the difference between replacement cost and net book value of the impaired assets the posthurricane costs incurred andor business interruption losses recognized the excess will be reflected as income in the period those amounts are received or when receipt is deemed probable to occur 

general and administrative 

for the year ended    december 31 2012  general and administrative expense decreased   62  or 29 million  from the comparable period in 2011 the change was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs of 25 million which is attributable to less acquisition activity during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the comparable period in 2011  

for the year ended   december 31 2011  general and administrative expense increased 15 or 672000 from the comparable period in 2010 the increase was due to a number of factors none of which are significant 

severance costs and other restructuring charges 

for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011  the company recognized 733000  and 13 million  of severance charges respectively 

for the year ended december 31 2010  the company recognized 68 million of severance and restructuring charges as the company consolidated its corporate operations and centralized job functions to its highlands ranch colorado headquarters from its richmond virginia office also included in these charges were severance costs related to the retirement of an executive officer 

gains on the sale of depreciable property 

for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we recognized gains before tax for financial reporting purposes of 2604 million  1385 million  and 41 million  respectively these gains are included in “income from discontinued operations net of tax” on the consolidated statements of operations changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures property taxes utilities and material costs the majority of our leases are for a term of fourteen months or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2012  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012   dollars in thousands 



 

 during 2012  we incurred gross interest costs of 1652 million of which 264 million  was capitalized 

united dominion realty lp 

business overview

udr operates as a selfadministered real estate investment trust or reit udr focuses on owning acquiring renovating developing and managing apartment communities nationwide the general partner was formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation and changed its state of incorporation from virginia to maryland in september 2003 at december 31 2012  the general partner’s consolidated real estate portfolio included 145  communities located in 10  states and the district of columbia with a total of 41571  apartment homes in addition the general partner has an ownership interest in 39  communities with 9558  completed apartment homes through unconsolidated joint ventures 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of and for the year ended december 31 2012  

 we report in two segments same communities and nonmatureother communities our same communities segment includes those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2011  and held as of december 31 2012  these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the community is not held for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months our nonmatureother communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2011 or 2012 sold properties redevelopment properties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured or unsecured debt the sale of properties the borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent from cash flows provided by operating activities 

as of december 31 2012  the operating partnership had approximately 459 million  of secured debt maturing in 2013  inclusive of principal amortization we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows and proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the “receivable due from general partner” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

capital expenditures 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

during the year ended december 31 2012  721 million  was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities as compared to 632 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  these capital improvements included turnoverrelated capital expenditures revenueenhancing capital expenditures asset preservation expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades other extensive interiorexterior upgrades and major renovations 

we will continue to selectively add revenueenhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

in october 2012 hurricane sandy hit the east coast affecting two operating communities 1001 apartment homes located in new york city the properties suffered some physical damage and based on management’s estimates the operating partnership recorded an impairment charge of 71 million  related to the damaged assets see note 12 hurricane related charges  of the operating partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional information 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

statements of cash flows 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by  operating activities net cash provided byused in  investing activities and used inprovided by  financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  

operating activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  net cash flow provided by  operating activities was 2011 million  compared to 1561 million  for the comparable period in 2011  the increase in  net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio and changes in operating assets and operating liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2011  net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1561 million compared to 1466 million for the comparable period in 2010  the increase in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio which was partially offset by the increase in operating assets and a decrease in operating liabilities 

investing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  net cash provided byused in  investing activities was 43 million  compared to 2270 million  for the comparable period in 2011  changes in the level of investment activities from period to period reflect our strategy as it relates to acquisitions dispositions development redevelopment and capital expenditures 

for the year ended december 31 2011  net cash used in investing activities was 2270 million  compared to 595 million  for the comparable period in 2010  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to acquisition activities partially offset by proceeds received from dispositions in 2011  

acquisitions and dispositions 

the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2012  during the year ended december 31 2011  the operating partnership acquired four  communities with 1833   apartment homes for 7612 million  

 during the year ended    december 31 2012  the operating partnership sold four  communities with 1314  apartment homes for a gain of 511 million  during the year ended   december 31 2011  the operating partnership sold eight  communities with 2024  apartment homes which included four  communities with 984  homes sold in conjunction with an asset exchange for a gain of 601 million  

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in target locations in core markets as a result we have been seeking to expand our interests in communities located in boston massachusetts california washington dc new york new york and seattle washington markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing which are three key drivers to strong rental growth 

real estate under development and redevelopment 

at december 31 2012  the operating partnership is developing two whollyowned communities totaling 652 homes with a budget of 2191 million in which we have a carrying value of 874 million the estimated completion date for these communities will be through the second quarter of 2014 

at december 31 2012  the operating partnership is redeveloping two whollyowned communities with 964 apartment homes of which 121 have been completed the estimated completion date for these communities will be through the second quarter of 2014 

financing activities 

for the year ended   december 31 2012  our net cash used inprovided by  financing activities was 2033 million  compared to 707 million  for the comparable period of 2011  the change in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments on secured debt and a decrease in advances from the general partner partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of secured debt 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our net cash provided by financing activities was 707 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 867 million for 2010 the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in advances from the general partner partially offset by an increase in payments of secured debt 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2012  the general partner had secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 9313 million  with 8425 million  outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years  and bear interest at floating and fixed rates at december 31 2012  6311 million  of the funded balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 511  and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 207  at december 31 2012  5078 million  of these credit facilities are allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

as of december 31 2011  the general partner had secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 13 billion with 11 billion  outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years maturing at various dates from may 2017 through december 2019 bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at the general partner’s option at december 31 2011  7445 million  of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 514  and the remaining balance of 3105 million  on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of 163  6675 million  of these credit facilities were allocated to the operating partnership at december 31 2011  based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s 250 million term loan due january 2016  100 million term loan due january 2016  300 million of mediumterm notes due june 2018  and 400 million of mediumterm notes due january 2022 at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  the operating partnership guaranteed the general partner’s unsecured credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 900 million there were 760 million  and 4210 million  of borrowings outstanding on the unsecured credit facility at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 2016 million  in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2012  if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100  basis points our interest expense would increase by 20 million  based on the balance at december 31 2012  

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

the general partner utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges see note 8 derivative and hedging activity  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

net income attributable to op unitholders 

2012  vs 2011   

net income attributable to op unitholders was 440 million   024  per op unit for the year ended   december 31 2012  as compared to 302 million   017  per op unit for the comparable period in the prior year the increase  in net income attributable to op unit holders resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 these increases to our net income attributable to op unitholders were partially offset by 

 2011  vs 2010   

net income attributable to op unitholders was 302 million 017 per op unit for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to a net loss of 207 million 012 per op unit for the comparable period in the prior year the increase in net income attributable to op unit holders for the year ended december 31 2011 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

 

these increases to our net income attributable to op unitholders were partially offset by 

 apartment community operations 

our net income results primarily from net operating income “noi” generated from the operation of our apartment communities the operating partnership defines noi which is a nongaap financial measure as rental income less direct property rental expenses rental income represents gross market rent less adjustments for concessions vacancy loss and bad debt rental expenses include real estate taxes insurance personnel utilities repairs and maintenance administrative and marketing excluded from noi is property management expense which is calculated as 275 of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations and land rent 

the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total portfolio which includes discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010   dollars in thousands  



 

the following table is our reconciliation of total property noi to net incomeloss attributable to op unitholders as reflected for both continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010   dollars in thousands  



same store communities 

2012  vs 2011   

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2011  and held on december 31 2012  consisted of 17880  apartment homes and provided 72  of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2012  

noi for our same store community properties increased   65  or 124 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011 the increase  in property noi was primarily attributable to a 55  or 153 million   increase  in total revenue which was partially offset by a 32  or 29 million   increase  in operating expenses the increase  in revenues was primarily driven by a 52  or 140 million   increase  in rental rates and a 77  or 19 million   increase  in fee and reimbursement income physical occupancy remained the same at 954  and total income per occupied home increased   75  to 1439  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 72   increase  of 21 million  in real estate tax and a 65  or 906000   increase  in repair and maintenance costs which was partially offset by a 22  or 474000  decrease in personnel costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 688  for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to 681  for the comparable period in 2011  

2011  vs 2010   

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2010 and held on december 31 2011  consisted of 17880 apartment homes and provided 72 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2011  

noi for our same store community properties increased 61 or 109 million for the year ended december 31 2011  compared to the same period in 2010 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 46 or 122 million increase in rental income which was offset by a 15 or 13 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 44 or 113 million increase in rental rates physical occupancy decreased 02 to 954 and total income per occupied home increased 63 to 1364 for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to the prior year 

  

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to a 66 or 909000 increase in utility costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 681 for the year ended december 31 2011  as compared to 672 for the comparable period in 2010 

nonmatureother communities 

2012  vs 2011   

the remaining 789 million  or 28  of our total noi during the year ended december 31 2012  was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” the operating partnership’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same store communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for sale properties and nonapartment components of mixed use properties noi from nonmature communities increased 65  or 48 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the same period in 2011  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 764  or 172 million  from communities acquired in 2011  and an increase of 144  or 32 million  from redevelopment properties including communities completed in 2012  these increases in noi were partially offset by a decrease in noi of 779  or 159 million  from properties sold during 2012  and 2011  during the year ended december 31 2012  a 12 million increase to noi was recognized to reflect the establishment of a receivable from former residents previously written off at move out 

2011  vs 2010   

the remaining 740 million  and 548 million  of our noi during the year ended december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” our nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same store communities which include communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold or held for sale properties properties managed by thirdparties and properties classified as real estate held for sale noi from nonmature communities increased 351  or 192 million  for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in noi of 226 million  from acquisition activities in 2011 partially offset by a decrease in noi of 292  or 84 million  from properties sold in 2011 and 2010 or held for sale 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2012  real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations decreased  by 15  or 29 million  as compared to the comparable period in 2011  the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2012  is primarily the result of acquisitions in 2011 and dispositions in 2011 and 2012 as part of the operating partnership’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price is attributable to the fair value of intangible assets which are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

for the year ended december 31 2011  real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations increased by 189 or 315 million as compared to the comparable period in 2010  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the acquisition of four apartment home communities in 2011  

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2012  interest expense decreased  by 157  or 84 million  as compared to the same period in 2011  this increase is primarily due to a lower debt balances from the pay off of certain fixed rate mortgage notes payable and lower average borrowings on secured credit facilities and an increase in capitalized interest due to increased development and redevelopment activity 

for the year ended december 31 2011  interest expense increased 27 or 14 million as compared to the same period in 2010  this increase is primarily due to a higher debt balances from mortgages assumed in certain 2011 acquisitions issuance of a note payable due to the general partner in 2011 and an increase in the interest rate charged on the note payable to the general partner the increase is partially offset by lower average borrowings on secured credit facilities lower weighted average interest rates and the payment of a tax exempt secured note payable in 2011 

hurricanerelated charges 

in october 2012 hurricane sandy hit the east coast affecting two  of the operating partnership’s operating communities  1001  apartment homes located in new york city the properties suffered some physical damage and were closed to tenants 

for a period following the hurricane the operating partnership has insurance policies that provide coverage for property damage and business interruption 

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the operating partnership recognized a 71 million  impairment charge for the damaged assets’ net book value in addition the operating partnership incurred 70 million  of repair and cleanup costs for the year ended december 31 2012  the rehabilitation of these properties is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2013 

based on the claims filed and management’s estimates the operating partnership recognized 22 million  of business interruption losses for the year ended december 31 2012  18 million  of business interruption losses were related to rent concession rebates provided to tenants during the period the properties were uninhabitable was classified in “hurricanerelated charges net” and 400000  of business interruption losses were related to rent that was not contractually receivable was classified as a reduction to “rental income” on the consolidated statements of operations 

the impairment charge and the repair and cleanup costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2012  have been reduced by the estimated insurance recovery of 108 million  and are classified in “hurricanerelated charges net” on the consolidated statements of operations of the estimated insurance recovery 40 million was received during the year ended december 31 2012  since the operating partnership determined that it was probable of receipt the remaining 68 million  of the estimated insurance recovery was recorded as a receivable at december 31 2012  

to the extent that insurance proceeds ultimately exceed the difference between replacement cost and net book value of the impaired assets the posthurricane costs incurred andor business interruption losses recognized the excess will be reflected as income in the period those amounts are received or when receipt is deemed probable to occur 

general and administrative 

the operating partnership is charged directly for general and administrative expenses it incurs the operating partnership is also charged for other general and administrative expenses that have been allocated by udr to each of its subsidiaries including the operating partnership based on each subsidiary’s prorata portion of udr’s total apartment homes 

for the year ended december 31 2012  general and administrative expenses decreased   06  or 166000  as compared to the comparable period in 2011  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated costs associated with a decrease in acquisition activity in 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 which was partially offset by a number of factors none of which were significant 

for the year ended december 31 2011  general and administrative expenses increased 132 or 31 million as compared to the comparable period in 2010  the increase was primarily due to acquisitionrelated costs associated directly with acquisitions of properties by the operating partnership 

income from discontinued operations 

for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we recognized income from discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes of 542 million  672 million  and 71 million  respectively the change in income from discontinued operations primarily relates to the recognition of net gains from the sale of property of 511 million  601 million  and 152000  during the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2012  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

contractual obligations

great place to work and live 

we continue to make progress on automating our business as a way to drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in january 2009 our residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on our website our residents have access to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week to pay rent on line and to submit service requests in july 2010 we completed the roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio as a result of transforming operations through technology our residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams have become more efficient these improvements in adopting the web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a decline in marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and improved capabilities to better manage pricing of our available apartment homes 

in 2011 udrcom features and functionality were enhanced to increase user engagement and increase lead volume yearoveryear such as improved photography enhancements to the online web forms and improved layout of the individual udr community homepages in addition to improvements to wwwudrcom  we also improved our suite of mobile and tablet devices on the iphone ipad and android platforms these overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our web visitor traffic to almost 31 million visitors up 31 almost 21 million organic search engine visitors up 38 mobile traffic increased 112 mobile leads generated increased 115 and mobile as a percent of total web traffic was at 22 in q4 2011 overall the udrcom and mobile initiatives contributed to a 17 yearoveryear lead stream increase 

  10 

operating partnership strategies and vision 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets and enhance resident and associate service through technology as a result the operating partnership has sought to expand its interests in communities located in new york new york san francisco california boston massachusetts and metropolitan dc markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing three key drivers to strong rental growth 

markets and competitive conditions 

at december 31 2011 509 of our consolidated same store net operating income and 724 of the operating partnership’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in california metropolitan washington dc oregon and washington state we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

 

 

 

 

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment 

communities 

at december 31 2011 our apartment portfolio included 163 consolidated communities having a total of 47343 completed apartment homes and an additional 1963 apartment homes under development which included the operating partnership’s apartment portfolio of 77 consolidated communities having a total of 23160 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future 

at december 31 2011 the company is developing seven whollyowned communities with 2108 apartment homes 145 of which have been completed

at december 31 2011 the company is redeveloping seven whollyowned communities with 3123 apartment homes 467 of which have been completed

same store community comparison 

we believe that one pertinent quantitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store community’s net operating income which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

  11 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our same store noi increased by 181 million or 56 compared to the prior year the increase in noi for the 37869 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in rental rates and fee and reimbursement income partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and decreased occupancy 

for the year ended december 31 2011 the operating partnership’s same store noi increased by 115 million or 62 compared to the prior year the increase in noi for the 19194 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in revenue rental rates partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and decreased occupancy 

revenue growth in 2012 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2011 

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

  12 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect the business and the results of operations of the company and the operating partnership some of which are beyond the control of the company and the operating partnership the following is a description of important factors that may cause the actual results of operations of the company and the operating partnership in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects forwardlooking statements and such risks uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this report and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except to the extent otherwise required by law 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels the downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses including mortgage payments and real estate taxes generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to udr’s stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 

continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the us economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the us economy continues to experience weakness following a severe recession which has resulted in increased unemployment decreased consumer spending and a decline in residential and commercial property values although it is not clear whether the us economy has fully emerged from the recession high levels of unemployment have continued to persist if the economic recovery slows or stalls we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

substantial international national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations the values of and the cash flows from the properties we own are affected by developments in global national and local economies as a result of the recent recession and the significant government interventions federal state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending tax increases public sector job losses increased interest rates currency devaluations or other adverse economic events which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past the general risk of inflation is that our debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties high unemployment may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our rental revenues 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

  16 

 

in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect growth 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

  17 

 

in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

bankruptcy of developers in our development joint ventures could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the bankruptcy of one of the developers in any of our development joint ventures could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations the discharge in bankruptcy of the developer may require us to honor a completion guarantee and therefore might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than we would otherwise bear 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures if we use such a structure we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

we could incur significant insurance costs and some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

as a result of our substantial real estate holdings the cost of insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of our control we insure our properties with insurance companies that we believe have a good rating at the time our policies are put into effect the financial condition of one or more of our insurance companies that we hold policies with may be negatively impacted resulting in their inability to pay on future insurance claims their inability to pay future claims may have a negative impact on our financial results in addition the failure of one or more insurance companies may increase the costs to renew our insurance policies or increase the cost of insuring additional properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

  19 

real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather events certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults mudslides and fires and others where there are hurricanes tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of udr’s common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of udr’s common stock 

any material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on udr’s stock price 

our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures despite system redundancy the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources including computer viruses unauthorized access energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes including financial transactions and keeping of records which may include personal identifying information of tenants and lease data we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmitting and storing confidential tenant information such as individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we take steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect us 

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service is not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  20 

we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations the united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate control executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the recent economic downturn these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area culminated in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business the doddfrank act regulates derivative transactions which include certain instruments used in our risk management activities the doddfrank act contemplates that most swaps will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk while we may ultimately be eligible for such exceptions the scope of these exceptions is currently uncertain pending further definition through rulemaking proceedings although the doddfrank act includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted by the sec and the commodities futures trading commission the new legislation and any new regulations could increase the operational and transactional cost of derivatives contracts and affect the number andor creditworthiness of available hedge counterparties to us 

changes in the system for establishing us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board the “iasb” is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards “ifrs” ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation 

  21 

we are monitoring the sec’s activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted in addition switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to udr’s stockholders 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

our debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

  22 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds related margins liquidity and access to capital markets moody’s and standard  poor’s the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings on our senior unsecured debt these ratings are based on a number of factors which included their assessment of our financial strength liquidity capital structure asset quality and sustainability of cash flow and earnings due to changes in market conditions we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity and access to capital markets 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of udr’s stock our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the past few years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing the recent downgrade of the us credit rating by standard  poor’s and the ongoing european debt crisis have contributed to the instability in global credit markets continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our business additionally due to this uncertainty we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of udr’s common or preferred stock the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of udr’s common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy 

a change in us government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency the administration has proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  23 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2011 udr had approximately 11 billion of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 28 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2011 the operating partnership had approximately 2870 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 24 of total outstanding indebtedness to third parties as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common and preferred stock and debt securities 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

risks related to tax laws 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect udr’s stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to udr’s stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to udr’s stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to udr’s stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock in december 2009 the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 201012 which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to certain stock distributions made by publicly traded reits to satisfy their taxrelated distribution requirements this expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions under this expanded guidance for stock dividends declared on or after january 1 2008 and before december 31 2012 with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2011 the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit pursuant to certain stockholder elections to receive either stock or cash as a taxable distribution of property provided that among other conditions i the total amount of cash available for distribution is not less than 10 of the aggregate declared distribution and ii if too many stockholders elect to receive cash each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under the declaration but in no event will any such electing stockholder receive less than 10 of the stockholder’s entire entitlement in money the amount of such stock distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of udr’s common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance udr’s stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline 

  24 

dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates in general the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual us shareholders is 15 through 2012 unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit our distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to udr’s stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to udr’s stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership but cannot guarantee that it will qualify the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr if classified as a partnership the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a “publicly traded partnership” unless at least 90 of the operating partnership’s income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although the operating partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market because of the redemption right the operating partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code our qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification moreover new legislation court decisions or administrative guidance in each case possibly with retroactive effect may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the reit income and asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals and upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr’s stock 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of udr’s common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange “nyse” on which we list udr’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of udr’s common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in udr’s common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of udr’s common stock including 

 

  26 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of udr’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

we may change the dividend policy for udr’s common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of udr’s stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

  27 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of udr’s stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of udr’s stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to udr’s stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to udr’s stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of udr’s stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for udr’s stockholders or might otherwise be in udr’s stockholders’ best interests

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt and equity both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements and the issuance of debt or equity securities 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

in september 2009 the company entered into an equity distribution agreement under which the company may offer and sell up to 150 million shares of its common stock over time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2011 we sold 4395601 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1045 million at a weighted average price per share of 2378 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 21 million were approximately 1024 million 

in march 2011 the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement under which the company may offer and sell up to 200 million shares of its common stock over time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2011 we sold 11849079 shares of common stock through this program of which 419048 shares were settled subsequent to december 31 2011 for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 2977 million at a weighted average price per share of 2512 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 60 million were approximately 2917 million in september 2011 the company entered into a new equity distribution agreement in connection with filing a new registration statement on form s3 the new equity distribution agreement replaced the march 2011 agreement and no material changes were made to the equity distribution agreement 

in may 2011 the company issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of 4250 senior unsecured notes due june 2018 under its existing shelf registration statement interest is payable semiannually beginning in december 2011 the notes were priced at 98988  of the principal amount plus accrued interest from may 23 2011 to yield 4419 to maturity the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership 

in july 2011 the company closed a public offering of 20700000 shares of its common stock including 2700000 shares sold as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option in full at the closing at a price of 2500 per share for net proceeds of approximately 4963 million after underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 

in october 2011 the company entered into a 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility replacing the company’s 600 million credit facility the operating partnership issued a guarantee in connection with the new credit facility similar to the guarantee it issued under the prior facility the new facility has an initial term of four years and includes a oneyear extension option and contains an accordion feature that allows the company to increase the facility to 135 billion based on the company’s current credit ratings the credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 1225 basis points and a facility fee of 225 basis points as of december 31 2011 we had 4210 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility leaving 4790 million of unused capacity excluding 36 million of letters of credit at december 31 2011 

  41 

in january 2012 the company issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 4625 medium term notes due january 2022 interest is payable semiannually beginning in july 2012 the notes were priced at 99100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest from january 10 2012 to yield 4739 to maturity the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the operating partnership 

future capital needs 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded through unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities the sale of properties and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets may be funded through joint ventures by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

during 2012 we have approximately 2078 million of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and net of extension rights of 990 million and 994 million of unsecured debt maturing we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from our operations debt and equity offerings proceeds from the sales of properties and by exercising extension rights with respect to the secured debt 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

capital expenditures 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

during 2011 519 million or 1081 per apartment home was spent on recurring capital expenditures these include revenue enhancing capital expenditures exteriorinterior upgrades turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as exterior paint roofs siding parking lots and asset preservation capital expenditures in addition major renovations totaled 300 million for the year ended december 31 2011 total capital expenditures which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations of 819 million or 1706 per home was spent on all of our communities excluding development and commercial properties for the year ended december 31 2011 

  42 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development condominium conversions and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2012 are currently expected to be approximately 1150 per apartment home 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

  43 

reit status 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2011 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred immaterial federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

statements of cash flow 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2442 million compared to 2142 million for 2010 the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio which was partially offset by the increase in operating assets and a decrease in operating liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2142 million compared to 2294 million for 2009 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in operating assets and operating liabilities which include accrued restructuring and severance charges this decrease is partially offset by an increase in property net operating income 

investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash used in investing activities was 11 billion compared to net cash used in investing activities of 5838 million for 2010 the change relates to acquisitions of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 5838 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 1580 million for 2009 the change relates to acquisitions of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures which are discussed in further detail throughout this report

during the year ended december 31 2011 the company also acquired three parcels of land located in huntington beach california addison texas and boston massachusetts for a gross purchase price of 343 million 

our longterm strategic plan is to continue achieving greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been seeking to expand our interests in communities located in the new york new york san francisco california boston massachusetts and metropolitan dc markets over the past years prospectively we plan to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housingthree key drivers to strong rental growth

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash provided byused in financing activities was 3731 million compared to 781 million for the comparable period of 2009 the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from issuance of our common stock through a public offering in 2010

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we have secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 13 billion with 11 billion outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we have 7445 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 514 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 163 as of december 31 2011 we had 8973 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 532 and 2605 million was at a weighted average variable rate of 168 as of december 31 2010 

in october 2011 the company entered into a 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility replacing the company’s 600 million credit facility noted below the operating partnership issued a guarantee in connection with the new facility similar to the guarantee it issued under the prior facility the unsecured credit facility has an initial term of four years and includes a oneyear extension option and contains an accordion feature that allows the company to increase the facility to 135 billion based on the company’s current credit ratings the credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 1225 basis points and a facility fee of 225 basis points 153 at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 we had 4210 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility leaving 4790 million of unused capacity excluding 36 million of letters of credit at december 31 2011 

we had an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 600 million which we could have increased to 750 million at our election under certain circumstances this credit facility carried an interest rate equal to libor plus 475 basis points 089 interest at december 30 2010 and had a maturity of july 2012 as of december 31 2010 we had 318 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility leaving 5682 million of unused capacity excluding 48 million of letters of credit at december 31 2010 

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 11 billion in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2011 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 92 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate or of investments in nonconsolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property premiums or original issuance costs associated with preferred stock redemptions plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to gaap for the three years ended december 31 2011 dollars in thousands 

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count the effect of the conversion of the series e outperformance partnership shares the series e outperformance program terminated on december 31 2009 are antidilutive for the year ended december 31 2009 and are excluded from the diluted share count 

re 3 is our subsidiary whose activities include development and land entitlement re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation to determine whether gains from re 3 will be included in ffo the company considers whether the operating asset has been a short term investment we consider ffo with re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2011 shares in thousands 

 

  51 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows  dollars in thousands

noi for our same community properties increased 56 or 181 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 41 or 205 million increase in property rental income which was offset by a 14 or 23 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 40 or 191 million increase in rental rates and a 121 or 44 million increase in fee and reimbursement income which was offset by a 122 or 22 million increase in vacancy loss physical occupancy decreased 02 to 955 and total income per occupied home increased 50 to 1188

noi for our same community properties decreased 18 or 62 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 09 or 46 million decrease in property rental income and a 09 or 15 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 24 or 121 million decrease in rental rates which was offset by a 578 or 27 million decrease in concessions a 79 or 17 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 124 or 27 million increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy increased 04 to 957 and total income per occupied home decreased 15 to 1144

for the year ended december 31 2010 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 90 or 251 million as compared to the comparable period in 2009 the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2010 is primarily the result of the company’s acquisition of five communities with 1374 apartment homes during 2010 development completions during 2010 and 2009 and additional capital expenditures 

as part of the company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price is attributable to the fair value of intangible assets which are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2011 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 50 or 75 million as compared to 2010 this increase in interest expense was primarily due to slightly higher debt balances the increase was also attributable to the write off of 46 million of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of debt 

  55 

for the year ended december 31 2010 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 61 or 86 million as compared to 2009 this increase is primarily due to the company’s debt repurchase activity during 2010 and 2009 during the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized a loss of 10 million as a result of repurchasing some of our 3625 convertible senior notes in the open market as compared to our recognition of 98 million in gains resulting from the repurchase of unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of 2389 million in the open market in 2009 the decrease in our gain from debt repurchase activity was partially offset by a decrease of 38 million of expenses related to the tender of 375 million of unsecured debt in 2009

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2011 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in november 2010 the company acquired the hanover company’s “hanover” partnership interests in the hanovermetlife master limited partnership “udrmetlife i”

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the operating partnership is a party to 

future capital needs 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt the sale of properties the borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties the issuance of op units and the assumption or placement of secured debt 

during 2012 we have approximately 2102 million of secured debt maturing and we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements or by exercising extension rights on such secured debt as applicable the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the “receivable due from general partner” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

capital expenditures 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

during the year ended december 31 2011 632 million was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities as compared to 595 million for the year ended december 31 2010 these capital improvements included turnoverrelated capital expenditures revenue enhancing capital expenditures asset preservation expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades other extensive interiorexterior upgrades and major renovations 

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital 

  59 

impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and record the fair value to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases based on the fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining average contractual lease period 

statements of cash flows 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities net cash used inprovided by investing activities and net cash provided byused in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1561 million compared to 1466 million for the comparable period in 2010 the increase in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio which was partially offset by the increase in operating assets and a decrease in operating liabilities 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1466 million compared to 1573 million for 2009 the decrease in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in consolidated net loss primarily due to a decrease in property net operating income and increase in allocated general and administrative costs 

investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011 net cash used in investing activities was 2270 million compared to 595 million for the comparable period in 2010 the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to acquisition activities partially offset by proceeds received from dispositions in 2011 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 595 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 1296 million for the comparable period in 2009 this change was primarily due to the full payment received on a 2000 million note receivable in 2009 the activity during 2010 consisted entirely of capital expenditures 

acquisitions and dispositions 

in april 2011 udr and the operating partnership closed on an acquisition of a 493 home multifamily apartment community referred to as 10 hanover square located in new york new york the community was acquired for 2598 million which included assumed debt with a fair value of 2081 million and the issuance of 2569606 op units of the operating partnership the op units were deemed to have a value equal to the greater of 2500 or the volume weighted average closing price per share of the company’s common stock for the 10 day period ended on and including the date one business day prior to the settlement date for purchase price accounting purposes the fair value of these op units was 2447 at the settlement date 

  60 

in april 2011 the operating partnership and its general partner completed a 500 million asset exchange whereby the operating partnership acquired two multifamily apartment communities 833 homes and a parcel of land and udr acquired one multifamily apartment community 227 homes the acquired assets are 388 beale in san francisco ca 227 homes acquired by udr 14 north in peabody ma 387 homes and inwood west in woburn ma 446 homes the communities acquired were valued at 2630 million representing their estimated fair value the company and the operating partnership paid 281 million of cash and assumed debt with a fair value of 617 million the operating partnership sold four multifamily apartment communities 984 homes and udr sold two multifamily apartment communities 434 homes located in california as part of the transaction the communities are crest at phillips ranch villas at san dimas villas at bonita the arboretum rancho vallecitos and milazzo

for the year ended december 31 2010 the operating partnership had no property acquisitions 

the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been seeking to expand our interests in communities located in boston california metropolitan washington dc new york and the washington state markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including above average job growth low singlefamily home affordability and limited new supply for multifamily housing three key drivers to strong rental growth 

in 2011 the operating partnership sold eight apartment home communities 2024 homes which included four apartment home communities 984 homes sold in conjunction with an asset exchange in april 2011 for a total sales price of 2996 million proceeds from the sales were used primarily to acquire new communities reduce debt and repay our general partner during the year ended december 31 2010 we did not dispose of any apartment home communities 

financing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2011 our net cash provided by financing activities was 707 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 867 million for 2010 the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in advances from the general partner partially offset by an increase in payments of secured debt 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash used in financing activities was 867 million compared to 2901 million for 2009 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a net decrease in payments to the general partner partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from secured debt 

credit facilities 

as of december 31 2011 the general partner had secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 13 billion with 11 billion outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at the general partner’s option at december 31 2011 7445 million of the outstanding balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 514 and the remaining balance of 3105 million on these facilities had a weighted average variable interest rate of 163 6675 million of these credit facilities were allocated to the operating partnership at december 31 2011 based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

at december 31 2010 there was 8973 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 53 and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 17 7369 million of these credit facilities were allocated to the operating partnership at december 31 2009 based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

  61 

at december 31 2010 the operating partnership guaranteed the general partner’s unsecured credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 600 million the outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility was 318 million at december 31 2010 on october 25 2011 the operating partnership issued a guarantee in conjunction with a new 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into by our general partner the new facility replaces the general partner’s 600 million facility the outstanding balance under the new 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility was 4210 million at december 31 2011 

the operating partnership is also a guarantor on the general partner’s 250 million term loan which matures january 2016 100 million term loan which matures december 2016 300 million of medium term notes due june 2018 and 400 million of medium term notes due january 2022 issued in january 2012 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 2870 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2011 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 28 million based on the balance at december 31 2011 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

results of operations 

the following discussion explains the changes in results of operations that are presented in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years ended december 31 2011 and includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented

same store communities 

2011 — vs — 2010 

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2010 and held on december 31 2011 consisted of 19194 apartment homes and provided 753 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2011 

noi for our same store community properties increased 62 or 115 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 45 or 127 million increase in rental income and by a 13 or 12 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 44 or 118 million increase in rental rates physical occupancy decreased 03 to 953 and total income per occupied home increased 62 to 1333 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the prior year 

  63 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to a 68 or 989000 increase in utility costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 680 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 670 for the comparable period in 2010 

2010 — vs — 2009

noi for our same store community properties decreased 28  or 60 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 14 or 43 million decrease in property rental income and by a 17 or 17 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 28 or 88 million decrease in rental rates which was partially offset by a 548 or 17 million decrease in concessions a 73 or 926000 decrease in vacancy loss and a 47 or 11 million increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy increased 03 to 956 and total income per occupied home decreased 22 to 1279 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 35 or 533000 increase in utilities a 49 or 743000 increase in repairs and maintenance and a 30 or 719000 increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 07 or 242000 decrease in real estate taxes and a 37 or 241000 decrease in administrative and marketing costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income was 671 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 681 for the comparable period in 2009 

nonmatureother communities 

2011 — vs — 2010 

the remaining 654 million and 468 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” our nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same store communities which include communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties properties managed by thirdparties and properties classified as real estate held for disposition for the year ended december 31 2011 we recognized noi for acquired communities of 226 million redevelopments of 239 million and sold properties of 118 million for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized noi for redeveloped properties of 213 million and sold properties of 208 million 

2010 — vs — 2009

  64 

other income 

for the year ended december 31 2010 other income primarily includes a reversal of certain real estate tax accruals partially offset by losses due to the change in the fair value of derivatives 

for the years ended december 31 2009 other income primarily includes interest income on a note for 200 million that a subsidiary of the operating partnership received related to the disposition of 55 properties during 2008 in may 2009 the 200 million note was paid in full 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2011 real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations increased 189 or 315 million as compared to the comparable period in 2010 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the acquisition of four apartment home communities in 2011 as part of the operating partnership’s acquisition activities a portion of the purchase price is attributable to the fair value of intangible assets which are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

for the years ended december 31 2010 real estate depreciation and amortization from continuing and discontinued operations did not change significantly as compared to the comparable period in 2009 as the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions or dispositions during this period 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2011 interest expense increased 27 or 14 million as compared to the same period in 2010 this increase is primarily due to a higher debt balances from mortgages assumed on certain 2011 acquisitions issuance of a note payable due to the general partner in 2011 and an increase in the interest rate charged on the note payable due to the general partner the increase is partially offset by lower average borrowings on secured credit facilities lower weighted average interest rates and the payment of a tax exempt secured note payable in 2011 

for the year ended december 31 2010 interest expense decreased 25 or 13 million as compared to the same period in 2009 this decrease is primarily due a decrease in the interest rate charged on the note payable due to the general partner partially offset by slightly higher average borrowings on secured credit facilities 

general and administrative 

the operating partnership is charged directly for general and administrative expenses it incurs the operating partnership is also charged for other general and administrative expenses that have been allocated by udr to each of its subsidiaries including the operating partnership based on each subsidiary’s prorata portion of udr’s total apartment homes 

for the year ended december 31 2011 general and administrative expenses increased 132 or 31 million as compared to the comparable period in 2010 the increase was primarily due to acquisitionrelated costs associated directly with acquisitions of the operating partnership 

for the year ended december 31 2010 general and administrative expenses increased 379 or 64 million as compared to the comparable period in 2009 the increase was due to a number of factors including acquisitionrelated costs and severance and other restructuring charges recognized in 2010 the increases were consistent with the changes in udr’s general and administrative expenses and severance and other restructuring expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 

income from discontinued operations 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we recognized gains on property sales for financial reporting purposes of 601 million 152000 and 15 million respectively the increase in gains recognized for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the comparable period in 2010 was primarily due to the sale of eight apartment home communities in 2011 changes in the level of gains recognized in 2010 as compared to 2009 reflect the residual activities from specific properties sold 

  65 

inflation 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2011 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2010 the operating partnership was a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 600 million 318 million outstanding at december 31 2010 on october 25 2011 the operating partnership issued a guarantee in conjunction with a 900 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into by the general partner the facility replaced the general partner’s 600 million credit facility at december 31 2011 the outstanding balance under the 900 million unsecured credit facility was 4210 million 

the operating partnership is also a guarantor on the general partner’s 250 million term loan which matures january 2016 a 100 million term loan which matures december 2016 300 million of mediumterm notes due june 2018 and 400 million mediumterm notes due january 2022 issued in january 2012

continually improve operations 

 

we continue to make progress on automating our business as a way to drive operating efficiencies and to better meet the changing needs of our residents since its launch in january 2009 our residents have been utilizing the resident internet portal on our website our residents have access to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week to pay rent on line and to submit service requests in july 2010 we completed the roll out of online renewals throughout our entire portfolio as a result of transforming operations through technology our residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams have become more efficient these improvements in adopting the web as a way to conduct business with us have also resulted in a decline in marketing and advertising costs improved cash management and improved capabilities to better manage pricing of our available apartment homes 

 

in 2010 we launched an enhanced wwwudrcom website along and a new modern living website that highlights our premier urbanstyle location communities both udrcom and modern living feature innovative pointofview walking tours at select locations social media content sharing and a new “save to favorites” feature that entices firsttime visitors to revisit wwwudrcom in addition to improvements to wwwudrcom we also increased our suite of mobile and tablet device offerings with the addition of an ipad android blackberry and palm pre apartment search applications these overall enhancements have contributed to increasing our web visitor traffic to over 23 million visitors up 24 and almost 15 million organic search engine visitors up 30 which contributed to a 20 yearoveryear lead stream increase 

 

maintaining access to lowcost capital 

 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek and not just react to opportunities available in the marketplace we have structured our borrowings to stagger our debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt 

 

special dividend 

 

on november 5 2008 our board of directors declared a dividend on a preadjusted basis of 129 per share “the special dividend” the special dividend was paid on january 29 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9 2008 the dividend represented our fourth quarter recurring distribution of 033 per share and an additional special distribution of 096 per share due to taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during the year subject to our right to pay the entire special dividend in cash stockholders had the option to make an election to receive payment in cash or in shares however the aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders other than cash payable in lieu of fractional shares would not be less than 440 million 

 

the special dividend totaling 1771 million was paid on 137266557 shares issued and outstanding on the record date approximately 1331 million of the special dividend was paid through the issuance of 11358042 shares of common stock which was determined based on the volume weighted average closing sales price of our common stock of 1171 per share on the nyse on january 21 2009 and january 22 2009 in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” issued accounting standards update 201001 accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash “asu 201001” 

which considers distributions that contain components of cash and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form of distribution as a stock dividend such a distribution is treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid at december 31 2008 we accrued 1331 million of distribution payable related to the special dividend asu 201001 is effective for the company on december 15 2009 and should be applied on a retrospective basis as a result we reversed the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the special dividend which was retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods presented within the company’s form 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission or the “sec” on may 22 2009 and effectively issued these shares on january 29 2009 the payment date of the special dividend 

 

financing activities 

 

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2010

markets and competitive conditions 

 

at december 31 2010 557 of our consolidated same store net operating income and 76 of the operating partnership’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in california metropolitan washington dc oregon and washington state we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

  

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment 

 

communities 

 

at december 31 2010 our apartment portfolio included 172 consolidated communities having a total of 48553 completed apartment homes and an additional 930 apartment homes under development which included the operating partnership’s apartment portfolio of 81 consolidated communities having a total of 23351 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to absorb expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future 

 

same store community comparison 

 

we believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store community’s net operating income “noi” which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our same store community population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our same store noi decreased by 62 million or 17 compared to the prior year the decrease in noi for the 40699 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in rental rates and an increase in expenses which was partially offset by increased occupancy 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 the operating partnership’s same store noi decreased by 60 million or 27 compared to the prior year the decrease in noi for the 22104 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates and increase in operating expenses which was partially offset by increased occupancy 

 

revenue growth in 2011 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

 

tax matters 

 

udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit udr must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not incur federal income tax liability however any state or local revenue excise or franchise taxes that result from the operating activities of the operating partnership are incurred at the entity level 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

environmental matters 

 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to 

acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

 

insurance 

 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects 

 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or 

dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily market and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy which is adversely affected by among other things job losses and unemployment levels recession personal debt levels the downturn in the housing market stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future some of our major expenses including mortgage payments and real estate taxes generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 

  

continued economic weakness following the economic recession that the us economy recently experienced may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the us economy continues to experience weakness following a severe recession which has resulted in increased unemployment decreased consumer spending and a decline in residential and commercial property values although the us economy has emerged from the recession high levels of unemployment have persisted if the economic recovery slows or stalls we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels our rental revenues and the value of our properties any of which could adversely affect our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

 

substantial international national and local government spending and increasing deficits may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations the values of and the cash flows from the properties we own are affected by developments in global national and local economies as a result of the recent recession and the significant government interventions federal state and local governments have incurred record deficits and assumed or guaranteed liabilities of private financial institutions or other private entities these increased budget deficits and the weakened financial condition of federal state and local governments may lead to reduced governmental spending tax increases public sector job losses increased interest rates currency devaluations or other adverse economic events which may directly or indirectly adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses neither inflation nor deflation has materially impacted our operations in the recent past the general risk of inflation is that our debt interest and general and administrative expenses increase at a rate higher than our rental rates the predominant effects of deflation include high unemployment and credit contraction restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financing or refinancing for our properties high unemployment may have a negative effect on our occupancy levels and our rental revenues 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property furthermore we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

  

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

 16 

 

we do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we have in prior years which may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and the market value of our securities in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect growth 

 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

  

in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

 

bankruptcy of developers in our development joint ventures could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the bankruptcy of one of the developers in any of our development joint ventures could materially and adversely affect the relevant property or properties if the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a property has incurred recourse obligations the discharge in bankruptcy of the developer may require us to honor a completion guarantee and therefore might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than we would otherwise bear 

 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons 

or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures if we use such a structure we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

 

some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 

  

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

 

in addition our properties are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws including laws governing the management of wastes and underground and aboveground storage tanks noncompliance with these environmental health and safety laws could subject us to liability changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with environmental laws health and safety laws or increase liability for noncompliance this may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations 

 

as the owner or operator of real property we may also incur liability based on various building conditions for example buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain may contain or may have contained asbestoscontaining material or acm environmental health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners operators or employers for noncompliance with those requirements 

these requirements include special precautions such as removal abatement or air monitoring if acm would be disturbed during maintenance renovation or demolition of a building potentially resulting in substantial costs in addition we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 

 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or cost for remediation when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials mold growth may occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources and other biological contaminants such as pollen viruses and bacteria indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms including allergic or other reactions as a result the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants or to increase ventilation in addition the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

 

real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather events certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults mudslides and fires and others where there are hurricanes tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

we may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets and be forced to recognize impairment charges which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and the market price of our common stock a decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against such assets under gaap if we were to determine that with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery to the amortized cost of such assets if such a determination were to be made we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write down the amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired such impairment charges reflect noncash losses at the time of recognition subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale if we are required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future these charges could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and the per share trading price of our common stock 

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

 

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service in not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations the current united states administration and congress have enacted or called for consideration of proposals relating to a variety of issues including with respect to health care financial regulation reform climate control executive compensation and others we believe that these and other potential proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material at this time we are unable to predict with certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us 

 

certain rulemaking and administrative efforts that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing economic downturn these initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the united states at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform that followed in the wake of the great depression the federal legislative response in this area has culminated most recently in the enactment on july 21 2010 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “doddfrank act” many of the provisions of the doddfrank act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities thus the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time the doddfrank act including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules along with other legislative and regulatory proposals that are proposed or pending in the united states congress may 

limit our revenues impose fees or taxes on us andor intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable 

 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular including certain provisions of the doddfrank act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the costs and risks associated with accessing the us public markets because we are committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting corporate governance and public disclosure our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies we intend to continue to invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards and this investment has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

 

changes in the system for establishing us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board the “iasb” is a londonbased independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards “ifrs” ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

 

ifrs differs in material respects from gaap among other things ifrs has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities than gaap “fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities often resulting in fluctuations in such values as compared to gaap which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation 

 

the sec has proposed the mandatory adoption of ifrs by united states public companies starting in 2015 with early adoption permitted before that date it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted in addition switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs will be a complex undertaking we may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain 

 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that will be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards to be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy udr’ inc’s distribution requirements to maintain its status as a reit for federal income tax purposes in addition the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants we are also likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to 

repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow increase our financing costs and impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to udr inc’s stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

  

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

 

debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our stock our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control during the past few years the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our business additionally due to this uncertainty we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not 

be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

 

prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels tightening of credit in financial markets and high unemployment rates may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy 

 

a change in us government policy regarding fannie mae or freddie mac could have a material adverse impact on our business fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for secured multifamily rental real estate we and other multifamily companies depend heavily on fannie mae and freddie mac to finance growth by purchasing or guaranteeing apartment loans in september 2008 the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency the administration has recently proposed potential options for the future of mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sale assets uncertainty in the future activity and involvement of fannie mae and freddie mac as a source of financing could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 

 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2010 udr inc had approximately 1 billion of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 29 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date as of december 31 2010 the operating partnership had approximately 304 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 28 of total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest 

rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges in addition our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs 

 

risks related to tax laws 

 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if udr failed to qualify as a reit udr has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we could not reelect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a reit the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock in december 2009 the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 201012 which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to certain stock distributions made by publicly traded reits to satisfy their taxrelated distribution requirements this expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions under this expanded guidance for stock dividends declared on or after january 1 2008 and before december 31 2012 with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2011 the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit pursuant to certain stockholder elections to receive either stock or cash as a taxable distribution of property provided that among other conditions i the total amount of cash available for distribution is not less than 10 of the aggregate declared distribution and ii if too many stockholders elect to receive cash each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under the declaration but in no event will any such electing stockholder receive less than 10 of the stockholder’s entire entitlement in money the amount of such stock distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline 

udr may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite udr’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit udr is subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect udr’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws as discussed in the risk factors above because udr is organized and qualifies as a reit it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but it is subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

 

the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership but cannot guarantee that it will qualify the operating partnership intends to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes at any such time that the operating partnership admits additional limited partners other than udr inc if classified as a partnership the operating partnership generally will not be a taxable entity and will not incur federal income tax liability however the operating partnership would be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if it were a “publicly traded partnership” unless at least 90 of the operating partnership’s income was qualifying income as defined in the code a “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership whose 

partnership interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof although the operating partnership’s partnership units are not traded on an established securities market because of the redemption right the operating partnership’s units held by limited partners could be viewed as readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and the operating partnership may not qualify for one of the “safe harbors” under the applicable tax regulations qualifying income for the 90 test generally includes passive income such as real property rents dividends and interest the income requirements applicable to reits and the definition of qualifying income for purposes of this 90 test are similar in most respects the operating partnership may not meet this qualifying income test if the operating partnership were to be taxed as a corporation it would incur substantial tax liabilities and udr inc would then fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes unless it qualified for relief under certain statutory savings provisions and our ability to raise additional capital would be impaired 

 

risks related to our organization and ownership of udr inc’s stock 

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list udr inc’s common stock have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects in addition to the risks listed in this “risk factors” section a number of factors could negatively affect the price per share of our common stock including 

 

 26 

 

  

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

 

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on udr’s common stock as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of udr’s common stock 

 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company restricts the transferability of our stock and may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock absent such an exemption from our board of directors the transfer of our stock to any person in excess of the applicable ownership limit or any transfer of shares of such stock in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits will be considered null and void and the intended transferee of such stock will acquire no rights in such shares these provisions of our charter may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests

udr inc 

 

business overview 

 

we are a self administered real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops redevelops and manages apartment communities in select markets throughout the united states we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships heritage communities lp a delaware limited partnership and united dominion realty lp a delaware limited partnership 

 

at december 31 2010 our consolidated real estate portfolio included 172 communities located in 23 markets with a total of 48553 completed apartment homes and our total real estate portfolio inclusive of our unconsolidated communities included an additional 37 communities with 9891 completed apartment homes 

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

  

we report in two segments same communities and nonmatureother communities our same communities segment includes those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2009 and held as of december 31 2010 these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and 

operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year there is no plan to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and the community is not held for disposition within the current year a community is considered to have stabilized occupancy once it achieves 90 occupancy for at least three consecutive months our nonmatureother communities segment includes those communities that were acquired or developed in 2008 2009 or 2010 sold properties redevelopment properties properties classified as real estate held for disposition condominium conversion properties joint venture properties properties managed by third parties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt and equity both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements and the issuance of debt or equity securities 

 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission or “sec” which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

 

on september 13 2010 the company entered into an agreement to sell 16000000 shares of its common stock at a price of 2035 per share in an underwritten public offering the company granted the underwriters a 30day option to purchase up to an additional 2400000 shares of common stock to cover overallotments we sold 18400000 shares of common stock in this offering with aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 3744 million at a price per share of 2035 aggregate net proceeds from the offering after deducting related expenses were approximately 3592 million 

 

on september 15 2009 the company entered into an equity distribution agreement under which the company may offer and sell up to 15000000 shares of its common stock over time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2010 we sold 6144367 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 1108 million at a weighted average price per share of 1804 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 22 million were approximately 1086 million 

 

on december 7 2009 the company entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement with respect to the issue and sale by the company from time to time of its mediumterm notes series a due nine months or more from date of issue in february 2010 the company issued 150 million of 525 senior unsecured mediumterm notes under the amended and restated distribution agreement these notes were priced at 9946 of the principal amount at issuance and had a discount of 519000 at december 31 2010 

future capital needs 

 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from construction loans through joint ventures unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities the sale of properties and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be financed by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

 

during 2011 we have approximately 634 million of secured debt maturing inclusive of principal amortization and net of extension rights of 1881 million and 958 million of unsecured debt maturing we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from debt and equity offerings and by exercising extension rights with respect to the secured debt 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

 

during 2010 471 million or 1047 per apartment home was spent on recurring capital expenditures these include revenue enhancing capital expenditures exteriorinterior upgrades turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as exterior paint roofs siding parking lots and asset preservation capital expenditures in addition major renovations totaled 308 million for the year ended december 31 2010 total capital expenditures which in aggregate include recurring capital expenditures and major renovations of 779 million or 1732 per home was spent on all of our communities excluding development and commercial properties for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development condominium conversions and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

 

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2011 are currently expected to be approximately 1050 per apartment home 

 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

 

real estate investment properties 

 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

 

reit status 

 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2010 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred immaterial federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

statements of cash flow 

 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided byused in investing and net cash used inprovided by financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2142 million compared to 2294 million for 2009 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in operating assets which include an increase in lease tangibles related to the acquisition of five operating communities in 2010 and operating liabilities which include accrued restructuring and severance charges this decrease is partially offset by an increase in property net operating income 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2294 million compared to 1798 million for 2008 the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in operating liabilities and is partially offset by a reduction in property operating income 

 

investing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 5838 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 158 million for 2009 the change relates to acquisitions of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 158 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 3023 million for 2008 the change is primarily driven by a reduction in the disposition of real estate investments partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of real estate assets and capital expenditures all of which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

 

acquisitions 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 the company acquired five apartment communities located in orange county california baltimore maryland los angeles california and boston massachusetts for a total gross purchase price of 412 million during the same period the company also acquired land located in san francisco california for a gross purchase price of 236 million 

 

the following table summarizes udr’s real estate community acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2010 dollar amounts in thousands  

 

 

 

 

  

our longterm strategic plan is to continue achieving greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been seeking to expand our interests in communities located in california boston metropolitan dc oregon and washington state markets over the past years prospectively we plan to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best 

investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including favorable job formation low singlefamily home affordability and favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we acquired one community in dallas texas with 289 apartment homes for 285 million 

 

real estate under development 

 

at december 31 2010 our development pipeline for whollyowned communities totaled 930 apartment homes with a budget of 3389 million in which we have a carrying value of 979 million we anticipate the completion of these communities from the first quarter of 2012 through the third quarter of 2013

prior to their consolidation in 2009 we evaluated our investments in these joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we considered 

various factors to determine if a decrease in value of each of these investments is otherthantemporary in 2009 we recognized a noncash charge of 16 million representing the otherthantemporary decline in fair values below the carrying values of two of the company’s bellevue washington joint ventures

during 2009 udr and an unaffiliated third party formed a joint venture for the investment of up to 450 million in multifamily properties located in key high barrier to entry markets the partners will contribute equity of 180 million of which the company’s maximum equity will be 30 or 540 million when fully invested during 2010 the joint venture acquired its first property 151 homes located in metropolitan washington dc for 431 million at closing and at december 31 2010 the company owned 30 our investment at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 52 million and 242000 respectively

disposition of investments 

 

in 2010 udr sold one 149 apartment home community udr recognized an aftertax gain for financial reporting purposes of 4 million on this sale that is included in discontinued operations proceeds from the sale were used primarily to reduce debt 

 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we did not dispose of any communities 

 

we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into markets we believe will provide the best investment returns 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 udr sold 86 communities with a total of 25684 apartment homes for gross consideration of 17 billion 53 condominiums from two communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of 69 million one parcel of land for gross proceeds of 16 million and one commercial property for gross proceeds of 65 million we received 15 billion in cash and a note in the principal amount of 200 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 7864 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to acquire new communities and 

reduce debt during 2008 we decided to discontinue sales of units with the two communities identified for condominium conversion until such time that the market conditions turn favorable and it is economically beneficial to sell those units versus operate the residual 525 apartment homes of those communities as a result of our decision to revert the remaining units to operations the company recorded a charge to earnings of 17 million excluding the catch up for depreciation on the units when they were returned to operations 

 

as a result of our disposition activities in 2008 the company declared a special dividend payable to holders of our common stock for 096 per share included with our recurring distribution for the company’s fourth quarter of 2008 for a total of 129 per share payable on january 29 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9 2008 additional information regarding the special dividend is set forth in item 1 business in part 1 of this report 

 

in conjunction with the transaction in which we sold 86 communities for 17 billion we received a note in the amount of 2000 million the note was paid in full in 2009 

 

financing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash provided byused in financing activities was 3731 million compared to 781 million for the comparable period of 2009 

 

the following significant financing activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2010 

 

 47 

  

  

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash used in financing activities was 781 million compared to 4725 million for the comparable period of 2008 the decrease in financing activities was due to a net issuance of debt in 2009 versus net payments in 2008 and the repurchase of shares of our common stock in 2008 these cash outflows were offset by the issuance of common equity through a public offering 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we have secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 14 billion with 12 billion outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we have 8973 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 53 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 17 as of december 31 2010 we had 9500 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 54 and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 17 as of december 31 2009 

 

we have a 600 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on july 26 2012 under certain circumstances we may increase the 600 million credit facility to 750 million based on our current credit rating the 600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus 475 basis points in addition the unsecured credit facility contains a provision that allows us to bid up to 50 of the commitment and we can bid out the entire unsecured credit facility once per quarter so long as we maintain an investment grade rating as of december 31 2010 we had 318 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility leaving 5682 million of unused capacity excluding 48 million of letters of credit at december 31 2010 as of december 31 2009 we had 1893 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 

 

the fannie mae credit facilities and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these credit facilities 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 1 billion in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2010 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 93 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

funds from operations 

 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property premiums or original issuance costs associated with preferred stock redemptions plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to gaap for the three years ended december 31 2010 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count the effect of the conversion of the series e outperformance partnership shares the series e outperformance program terminated on december 31 2009 are antidilutive for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 and are excluded from the diluted share count 

 

re 3 is our subsidiary that focuses on development land entitlement and shortterm hold investments re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produces a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2010 shares in thousands 

 

 

 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows  dollars in thousands  

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

net loss income attributable to common stockholders

noi for our same community properties decreased 17 or 62 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 09 or 50 million decrease in property rental income and a 06 or 11 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 24 or 128 million decrease in rental rates which was offset by a 577 or 27 million decrease in concessions an 83 or 18 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 124 or 28 million increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy increased 04 to 957 and total income per occupied home decreased 16 to 1155 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 33 or 935000 increase in utilities expense a 38 or 11 million increase in repairs and maintenance and a 26 or 12 million increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 32 or 18 million decrease in real estate taxes 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income decreased to 663 as compared to 668 in the comparable period in the prior year

noi for our same community properties decreased 22 or 66 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 20 or 88 million decrease in property rental income which was partially offset by a 16 or 23 million 

decrease in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 29 or 129 million decrease in rental rates which was offset by an 189 or 40 million decrease in vacancy loss and an 86 or 14 million increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy increased 06 to 954 and total income per occupied home decreased 30 to 1149 

 

the decrease in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 13 or 568000 decrease in real estate taxes due to favorable tax appeals a 33 or 764000 decrease in repairs and maintenance and a 97 or 970000 decrease in administrative and marketing costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income decreased to 680 as compared to 681 in the comparable period in the prior year 

 

nonmature communities 

 

2010vs2009 

 

the remaining 467 million and 275 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same communities which include communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties properties classified as real estate held for disposition joint venture properties properties managed by thirdparties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties and condominium properties for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized noi for our developments of 157 million acquired communities of 127 million redeveloped properties of 123 million and sold properties of 980000 for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized noi for our developments of 63 million acquired communities of 28 million redeveloped properties of 115 million and sold properties of 14 million 

 

2009vs2008 

 

the remaining 952 million and 888 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same communities which include communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties properties classified as real estate held for disposition joint venture properties properties managed by thirdparties and the nonapartment components of mixed use properties and condominium properties for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized noi for our developments of 105 million acquired communities of 543 million and redeveloped properties of 248 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized noi for our developments of 24 million acquired communities of 382 million redeveloped properties of 221 million and sold properties of 235 million

tax benefitexpense of trs 

 

udr elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as trs income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future 

tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized a net benefit of 25 million from the writeoff of income taxes payable net of income taxes paid for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized tax expense of 311000 to the extent of cash taxes paid for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized a benefit of 97 million in continuing operations due to the results of operations and temporary differences associated with the trs tax benefits and expenses recognized during the years are included in “general and administrative” in the consolidated statements of operations included in this report 

 

other operating expenses 

 

other operating expenses decreased 99 or 639000 for the year ended december 31 2010 from the comparable period in 2009 the decrease was due to a number of factors none of which are significant for the year ended december 31 2009 other operating expenses increased 422 or 19 million compared to the comparable period in 2008 the increase is primarily due to additional costs incurred by the company related to longterm ground leases associated with properties acquired in december 2007 and july 2008 a schedule of future obligations related to ground leases is set forth under “contractual obligations” below 

 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 90 or 251 million as compared to the comparable period in 2009 the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2010 is primarily the result of the company’s acquisition of five communities with 1374 apartment homes during 2010 development completions during 2010 and 2009 and additional capital expenditures as part of the company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 105 or 264 million as compared to the comparable period in 2008 the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily the result of the company’s acquisition of 13 communities with 4558 apartment homes during 2008 development completions during 2009 and 2008 and additional capital expenditures as part of the company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

 

interest expense 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 61 or 86 million as compared to 2009 this increase is primarily due to the company’s debt repurchase activity during 2010 and 2009 during the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized a loss of 10 million as a result of repurchasing some of our 3625 convertible senior notes in the open market as compared to our recognition of 98 million in gains resulting from the repurchase of unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of 2389 million in the open market in 2009 the decrease in our gain from debt repurchase activity was partially offset by a decrease of 38 million of expenses related to the tender of 375 million of unsecured debt in 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 24 or 35 million as compared to 2008 this decrease is primarily due to the company’s debt repurchase activity during 2008 and 2009 during 2009 we recognized a gain of 98 million as a result of repurchasing unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of 2389 million in the open market throughout the year the gains were partially offset by 38 million of expenses related to the tender of 375 million of 

unsecured debt and 26 million for prepayment penalties and the writeoff of the fair market value adjustment for consolidated joint venture debt in addition the weighted average interest rate decreased from 49 in 2008 to 45 in 2009 which further reduced our interest expense the decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2009 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2009 when compared to the same period in 2008 

 

general and administrative 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 general and administrative expenses increased 86 or 34 million as compared to 2009 the increase is primarily due to an increase in acquisition costs of 29 million related to the company’s acquisitions of five operating communities and one parcel of land in 2010 an increase of 48 million in compensation expense including deferred compensation and bonuses which was partially offset by a decrease in taxes of 16 million and an increase in tax benefit which is discussed in “tax benefitexpense of trs” above 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 general and administrative expenses increased 47 or 18 million as compared to 2008 the increase was due to a decrease in tax benefit which is discussed in “tax benefitexpense of trs” above and is offset by a number of factors including the company writing off acquisitionrelated costs the company no longer pursuing a condominium strategy which resulted in writing off 17 million in deferred sales charges the renegotiation andor cancellation of certain operating leases andor vendor contracts of 08 million the company cancelling a contract to acquire a presale property which resulted in a charge of 17 million and the acquisitions of certain contractual rights related to a joint venture which resulted in the company incurring a charge of 305000 for the profit component of the contracts which were in recognized in 2008 

 

severance costs and other restructuring charges 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 the company recognized 68 million of severance and restructuring charges as the company consolidated its corporate operations and centralized job functions to its highlands ranch colorado headquarters from its richmond virginia office also included in these charges were severance costs related to the retirement of an executive officer 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recognized 653000 of severance and restructuring charges as the company consolidated its operations in highlands ranch colorado in addition we announced reductions to certain positions related to both operations and corporate staff 

 

gains on the sale of land and depreciable property 

 

for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 41 million 24 million and 7862 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

in connection with the purchase of hanover’s interests in the udrmetlife partnership udr agreed to indemnify hanover from liabilities from hanover’s guaranty of 333 million in loans which are secured by a 

security interest in the operating community subject to the loan at december 31 2010 the loans are to the subtier partnerships which own the 26 operating communities the company anticipates that the balance of these loans will be refinanced by the partnership over the next twelve months 

 

we do not have any other offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

 

contractual obligations

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity the operating partnership’s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the general partner will routinely use its unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities and potential property acquisitions through borrowings and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of distributions likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations and borrowings allocated to us under the general partner’s credit agreements the operating partnership is a party to 

 

future capital needs 

 

future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the issuance of secured debt the sale of properties the borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties the issuance of op units and the assumption or placement of secured debt 

 

during 2011 we have approximately 422 million of secured debt maturing and we anticipate that we will repay that debt with operating cash flows proceeds from borrowings allocated to us under our general partner’s credit agreements or by exercising extension rights on such secured debt as applicable the repayment of debt will be recorded as an offset to the “receivable due from general partner”

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

capital expenditures 

 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

 

during year ended december 31 2010 595 million was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities as compared to 704 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 these capital improvements included turnoverrelated capital expenditures revenue enhancing capital expenditures asset preservation expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades other extensive interiorexterior upgrades and major renovations 

 

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

 

real estate investment properties 

 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb asc 805 business combinations formerly sfas 141r “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

 

statements of cash flows 

 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities net cash used inprovided by investing activities and net cash used in financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1466 million compared to 1573 million for the comparable period in 2009 the decrease in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due an increase in consolidated net loss primarily due to a decrease in property net operating income and an increase in allocated general and administrative costs 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1573 million compared to 1687 million for 2008 the decrease in net cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in property net operating income from our apartment community portfolio a decrease in interest income related to a 200 million note receivable that was paid off during 2009 and higher interest expense partially offset by a decrease in other operating liabilities 

investing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 net cash used in investing activities was 595 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 1296 million for the comparable period in 2009 this change was primarily due to the full payment received on a 200 million note receivable in 2009 the activity during 2010 consisted entirely of capital expenditures 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash provided by investing activities was 1296 million compared to 820 million for 2008 the increase in cash is primarily driven by the proceeds from a 200 million note receivable in 2009 and a reduction in acquisition activity and capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 this is partially offset by the proceeds from dispositions of 880 million in 2008 

 

acquisitions 

 

for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no property acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2008 we acquired nine apartment communities with 3348 apartment homes for aggregate consideration of 7136 million the operating partnership’s longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been seeking to expand our interests in communities located in california metropolitan washington dc and the washington state markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will continue to provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including favorable job formation low singlefamily home affordability and favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing 

 

dispositions 

 

during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we did not dispose of any communities during the year ended december 31 2008 we sold 55 communities with a total of 16960 apartment homes for net proceeds of 880 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 4752 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to acquire new communities reduce debt and repay our general partner 

 

in conjunction with this transaction a subsidiary of the operating partnership received a note in the amount of 200 million the note was paid in full in 2009 

 

financing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our net cash used in financing activities was 867 million compared to 2901 million for 2009 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a net decrease in payments to the general partner partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from secured debt 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash used in financing activities was 2901 million compared to 2472 million for the comparable period of 2008 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a net increase in payments to the general partner which was partially offset by the net activity on secured debt 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the general partner had secured credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 14 billion with 12 billion outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at the general partner’s option at december 31 2010 8973 million of the funded balance was fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 53 and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 17 at december 31 2010 7369 million of these credit facilities are allocated to the operating partnership based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

at december 31 2009 there was 950 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 54 and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 17 7504 million of these credit facilities were allocated to the operating partnership at december 31 2009 based on the ownership of the assets securing the debt 

 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 600 million on a 100 million term loan and on the 250 million term loan facility at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 the outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility was 318 million and 1893 million respectively 

 

the credit facilities are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

 

other guarantees 

 

at december 31 2010 the operating partnership guaranteed certain outstanding securities of udr such that the operating partnership as primary obligor and not merely as surety irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each holder of the applicable securities and to the trustee and their successors and assigns under the respective indenture a the full and punctual payment when due whether at stated maturity by acceleration or otherwise of all obligations of udr under the respective indenture whether for principal of or interest on the securities and premium if any and all other monetary obligations of udr under the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities and b the full and punctual performance within the applicable grace periods of all other obligations of udr under the respective indenture and the terms of the applicable securities 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 3035 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2010 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 3 million based on the balance at december 31 2010 

 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure

2010vs2009 

 

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2009 and held on december 31 2010 consisted of 22104 apartment homes and provided 937 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

noi for our same store community properties decreased 27 or 60 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 14 or 46 million decrease in property rental income and by a 14 or 15 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 29 or 94 million decrease in rental rates which was partially offset by a 49 or 12 million increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy increased 04 to 956 and total income per occupied home decreased 24 to 1287 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 36 or 582000 increase in utilities a 764000 or 48 increase in repairs and maintenance and a 31 or 767000 increase in personnel costs which was partially offset by a 16 or 571000 decrease in real estate taxes and a 37 or 252000 decrease in administrative and marketing costs

noi for our same store community properties decreased 25 or 44 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 24 or 62 million decrease in property rental income which was partially offset by a 23 or 18 million decrease in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 31 or 77 million decrease in rental rates and a 521 or 573000 increase in bad debt which was offset by an 137 or 16 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 73 or 739000 increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy increased 03 to 953 and total income per occupied home decreased 23 to 1266 

the decrease in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 60 or 223000 decrease in insurance a 21 or 249000 decrease in utilities a 55 or 706000 decrease in repairs and maintenance a 383 or 298000 decrease in incentive bonuses and a 66 or 365000 decrease in administrative and marketing costs

nonmatureother communities 

 

2010vs2009 

 

the remaining 148 million and 152 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” our nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same store communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties properties managed by thirdparties the nonapartment components of mixed use properties and properties classified as real estate held for disposition for the year ended december 31 2010 we recognized noi for redevelopments of 102 million the remainder was primarily due to the nonapartment components of mixed use properties for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized noi for redeveloped properties of 95 million the remaining noi was primarily due to the nonapartment components of mixed use properties 

 

2009vs2008 

 

the remaining 668 million and 678 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” our nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same store communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties and properties classified as real estate held for disposition for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized noi for our acquired communities of 493 million and redevelopments of 118 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized noi for our acquired communities of 355 million sold communities of 152 million and redeveloped properties of 118 million 

 

other income 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 other income primarily includes a reversal of certain real estate tax accruals partially offset by losses due to the change in the fair value of derivatives 

 

for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 other income primarily includes interest income on a note for 200 million that a subsidiary of the operating partnership received related to the disposition of 55 properties during 2008 in may 2009 the 200 million note was paid in full 

 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

 

for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 real estate depreciation and amortization did not change significantly as the operating partnership did not have any acquisitions or dispositions during these respective periods 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 real estate depreciation and amortization increased 79 or 122 million as compared to the comparable period in 2008 the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily the result of the acquisition of nine communities with 3348 apartment homes during 2008 and additional capital expenditures as part of the operating partnership’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

interest expense 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 interest expense decreased 25 or 13 million as compared to the same period in 2009 this decrease is primarily due a decrease in the interest rate charged on the note payable due to the general partner partially offset by slightly higher average borrowings on secured credit facilities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 147 or 69 million as compared to 2008 this increase is primarily due to additional borrowings on fnma credit facilities offset by debt repayments and maturities 

 

general and administrative 

 

the operating partnership is charged directly for general and administrative expenses it incurs the operating partnership is also charged for other general and administrative expenses that have been allocated by udr to each of its subsidiaries including the operating partnership based on each subsidiary’s prorata portion of udr’s total apartment homes 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 general and administrative expenses increased 379 or 64 million as compared to the comparable period in 2009 the increase was due to a number of factors including acquisitionrelated costs and severance and other restructuring charges recognized in 2010 the increases were consistent with the changes in udr’s general and administrative expenses and severance and other restructuring expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 general and administrative expenses decreased 115 or 22 million as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to a number of factors including the write off of acquisitionrelated costs and severance and restructuring costs recognized in 2008 

 

income from discontinued operations 

 

for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 152000 15 million and 4752 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the residual activities from specific properties sold 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

the operating partnership is a guarantor on the general partner’s unsecured credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 600 million a 100 million term loan and a 250 million term loan at december 31 2010 and 2009 the outstanding balance under the unsecured credit facility was 318 million and 1893 million respectively

udr’s strategies and vision 

 

udr previously announced its vision to be the innovative multifamily public real estate investment of choice we identified the following strategies to guide decisionmaking and growth 

 

1 strengthen our portfolio 

 

2 continually improve operations 

 

3 maintain access to lowcost capital 

 

strengthen our portfolio 

 

udr is focused on increasing its presence in markets with favorable job formation low singlefamily home affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio decisions consider thirdparty research taking into account job growth multifamily permitting and housing affordability 

 

in 2008 udr sold a portfolio of properties in 86 communities for total consideration of approximately 17 billion this portfolio sale dramatically accelerated our transformation to focus on markets that have the best growth prospects based on favorable job formation and low singlefamily home affordability at 

december 31 2009 approximately 568 of the company’s same store net operating income was provided by our communities located in california metropolitan washington dc oregon and washington state 

 

acquisitions and dispositions 

 

during 2009 in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our portfolio udr acquired a new constructed community with 289 apartment homes for approximately 285 million udr targets apartment community acquisitions in markets where job growth expectations are favorable singlefamily home affordability is low and the demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing is favorable 

 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider

maintaining access to lowcost capital 

 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek and not just react to opportunities available in the marketplace we have structured our borrowings to stagger our debt maturities and to be able to opportunistically access both secured and unsecured debt 

 

special dividend 

 

on november 5 2008 our board of directors declared a dividend on a preadjusted basis of 129 per share “the special dividend” the special dividend was paid on january 29 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9 2008 the dividend represented the company’s fourth quarter recurring distribution of 033 per share and an additional special distribution of 096 per share due to taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during the year subject to the company’s right to pay the entire special dividend in cash stockholders had the option to make an election to receive payment in cash or in shares however the aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders other than cash payable in lieu of fractional shares would not be less than 440 million 

the special dividend totaling 1771 million was paid on 137266557 shares issued and outstanding on the record date approximately 1331 million of the special dividend was paid through the issuance of 11358042 shares of common stock which was determined based on the volume weighted average closing sales price of our common stock of 1171 per share on the nyse on january 21 2009 and january 22 2009 in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” issued accounting standards update 201001 accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash “asu 201001” which considers distributions that contain components of cash and stock and allows shareholders to select their preferred form of distribution as a stock dividend such a distribution is treated as a stock issuance on the date the dividend is paid at december 31 2008 the company accrued 1331 million of distribution payable related to the special dividend asu 201001 is effective for the company on december 15 2009 and should be applied on a retrospective basis as a result the company reversed the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the special dividend which was retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods presented within the company’s form 8k filed with the securities and exchange commission or the “sec” on may 22 2009 and effectively issued these shares on january 29 2009 the payment date of the special dividend 

 

financing activities 

 

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2009 

 

  

markets and competitive conditions 

 

at december 31 2009 568 of the company’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in california metropolitan washington dc oregon and washington state we 

believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits some of which may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

  

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment 

 

communities 

 

at december 31 2009 our apartment portfolio included 165 consolidated communities having a total of 45913 completed apartment homes and an additional 1415 under development the overall quality of our portfolio enables us to raise rents and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore should result in increased cash flow in the future 

 

same community comparison 

 

we believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store community’s net operating income “noi” which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our same store population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year for the year ended december 31 2009 our same store noi decreased by 66 million or 22 compared to the prior year the decrease in noi for the 33166 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by a decrease in revenue rental rates which was partially offset by increased occupancy and a decrease in expenses 

 

revenue growth in 2010 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

tax matters 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

environmental matters 

 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been 

notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

 

insurance 

 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured with limits of liability customary within the industry against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made 

 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms some of our major expenses including mortgage payments and real estate taxes generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 

 12 

 

  

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we have periodically disposed of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

  

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

  

we do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we have in prior years which may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and the market value of our securities in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other public and private apartment reits have competed with us to 

acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect growth 

 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

  

in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

 

some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing markets entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 

  

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our debt interest and general and administrative expenses as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental rates 

 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures if we use such a structure we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

 

real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the 

restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather events certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults mudslides and fires and others where there are hurricanes tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

 

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service in not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs 

 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay 

distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

  

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

 

debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

 

financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions recently domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty while this condition has occurred most visibly within the “subprime” mortgage lending sector of the credit market liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial markets including the investment grade debt and equity capital markets consequently there is greater risk that the financial institutions we do business with could experience disruptions that would negatively affect our ability to obtain financing 

 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit impact our tenant base and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our stock our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our business additionally due to this uncertainty we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might 

adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

 

prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels current tightening of credit in financial markets and increasing unemployment may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy 

 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 7092 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 207 of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

 

risks related to tax laws 

 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the two taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock in december 2009 the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 201012 which expanded previously issued temporary guidance relating to certain stock distributions made by publicly traded reits to satisfy their taxrelated distribution requirements this expanded temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions under this expanded guidance for stock dividends declared on or after january 1 2008 and before december 31 2012 with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2011 the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit pursuant to certain stockholder elections to receive either stock or cash as a taxable distribution of property provided that among other conditions i the total amount of cash available for distribution is not less than 10 of the aggregate declared distribution and ii if too many stockholders elect to receive cash each stockholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash corresponding to its respective entitlement under the declaration but in no event will any such electing stockholder receive less than 10 of the stockholder’s entire entitlement in money the amount of such stock distribution will generally be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline 

 

we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit we are subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes 

we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws as discussed in the risk factors above because we are organized and qualify as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income taxes but we are subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

 

risks related to our organization and our shares 

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

 

the market price per share of our common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including 

 

 20 

 

  

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations business or our prospects 

 

we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future as well as the timing amount and composition of any such future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings funds from operations liquidity financial condition capital requirements contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code state law and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of december 31 2009 

 

 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale of properties and the issuance of debt and equity both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes and borrowings under credit agreements we routinely use our unsecured credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to 

arranging for longerterm financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities as we repositioned our portfolio 

 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through secured and unsecured borrowings the issuance of debt or equity securities and the disposition of properties we believe that our net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations borrowings under credit agreements and the issuance of debt or equity securities 

 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

 

on september 15 2009 the company entered into an equity distribution agreement under which the company may offer and sell up to 150 million shares of its common stock over time to or through its sales agents during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold 4460032 shares of common stock through this program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 691 million at a weighted average price per share of 1548 aggregate net proceeds from such sales after deducting related expenses including commissions paid to the sales agents of approximately 14 million and related issuance costs of approximately 500000 were approximately 672 million 

 

on december 7 2009 the company entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement with respect to the issue and sale by the company from time to time of its mediumterm notes series a due nine months or more from date of issue as of december 31 2009 the company had not issued any mediumterm notes under the amended and restated distribution agreement dated december 7 2009 

 

future capital needs 

 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from construction loans through joint ventures unsecured or secured credit facilities proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities the sale of properties and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties through the issuance of equity or debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units and the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

 

during 2010 we have approximately 2374 million of secured debt and 500 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities the issuance of equity or debt securities and by exercising extension rights of 1515 million with respect to secured debt 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or where significant judgment is required 

capital expenditures 

 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

 

during 2009 864 million or 1986 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development condominium conversions and commercial properties compared to 1310 million or 2838 per home spent in 2008 these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as exterior paint roofs siding parking lots and asset preservation capital expenditures which aggregated 293 million or 674 per home for the year ended december 31 2009 in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades and other extensive exteriorinterior upgrades totaled 236 million or 543 per home and major renovations totaled 335 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development condominium conversions and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

 

 

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2010 are currently expected to be approximately 1000 per home 

 

investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

in accordance with fasb accounting standards codificiation “asc” 32310 investments equity method and joint ventures formerly apb opinion 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” “subtopic 32310” we continually evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures when events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an otherthantemporary decline in value we consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is otherthantemporary these factors include but are not limited to age of the venture our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity the financial condition and longterm prospects of the entity and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders the amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value if we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary no impairment is recorded the aforementioned factors are taken as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our investment property should the actual results differ from management’s judgment the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb asc 805 business combinations formerly sfas 141r “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

 

reit status 

 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2009 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred immaterial federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

 

statements of cash flow 

 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided byused in investing and financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2294 million compared to 1798 million for 2008 the increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to changes in operating liabilities and is partially offset by a reduction in property operating income 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1798 million compared to 2693 million for 2007 during 2008 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from a reduction in property operating income from our apartment community portfolio and a significant reduction in operating liabilities the reduction in property operating income was driven by the company completing the sale of a significant component of our portfolio in the first quarter of 2008 a portion of the proceeds from the disposition were reinvested in subsequent quarters which diluted the net cash provided by operations for the period in which the company held restricted 1031 cash funds in lieu of revenue generating operating communities 

investing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 net cash used in investing activities was 1580 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 3023 million for 2008 the change is primarily driven by a reduction in the disposition of real estate investments partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of real estate assets and capital expenditures all of which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash provided by investing activities was 3023 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 901 million for 2007 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to acquisitions capital expenditures development and disposition activities as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

 

acquisitions 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 we acquired one community in dallas texas with 289 units for 285 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we acquired 13 apartment communities with 4558 apartment homes two parcels of land and one retail property for aggregate consideration of 10 billion our longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been expanding our interests in communities located in california florida metropolitan dc and the washington state markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including favorable job formation low singlefamily home affordability and favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing 

 

real estate under development 

 

at december 31 2009 our development pipeline for whollyowned communities totaled 1576 homes with a budget of 2586 million in which we have a carrying value of 2169 million we anticipate the completion of these communities during 2010

disposition of investments 

 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we did not dispose of any communities during the year ended december 31 2008 udr sold 86 communities with a total of 25684 apartment homes for gross consideration of 17 billion 53 condominiums from two communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of 69 million one parcel of land for gross proceeds of 16 million and one commercial property for gross proceeds of 65 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 7864 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to acquire new communities and reduce debt during 2008 we decided to discontinue sales of units with the two communities identified for condominium conversion until such time that the market conditions turn favorable and it is economically beneficial to sell those units versus operate the residual 525 units of those communities as a result of our decision to revert the remaining units to operations the company recorded a charge to earnings of 17 million excluding the catch up for depreciation on the units when they were returned to operations 

 

as a result of our disposition activities in 2008 the company declared a special dividend payable to holders of our common stock for 096 per share included with our recurring distribution for the company’s fourth quarter of 2008 for a total of 129 per share payable on january 29 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9 2008 additional information regarding the special dividend is set forth in item 1 business in part 1 of this report 

 

in conjunction with the transaction in which we sold 86 communities for 17 billion we received a note in the amount of 2000 million the note was paid in full during the year ended december 31 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 udr sold 21 communities with a total of 7125 apartment homes for gross consideration of 7292 million one parcel of land for 45 million and contributed one property under development at cost to a joint venture arrangement in texas in addition we sold 61 condominiums from two communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of 104 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 2391 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

 

financing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 our net cash used in financing activities was 781 million compared to 4725 million for the comparable period of 2008 

the following significant financing activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2009 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 our net cash used in financing activities was 4725 million compared to 1781 million for the comparable period of 2007 the increase in financing activities was due to increased net payments including debt buybacks on secured and unsecured debt the repurchase of shares of our 675 series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock and the repurchase of shares of our common stock these cash outflows were offset by the issuance of common equity through a public offering 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of december 31 2009 we have secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 14 billion with 12 billion outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we have 9500 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 54 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 17 

 

as of december 31 2008 we had secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 10 billion with 8312 million outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we had 6666 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 55 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 31 

 

on july 27 2007 we amended and restated our existing threeyear 500 million unsecured bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of may 31 2008 which could be extended for an additional year at our option to increase the facility to 600 million and to extend its maturity to july 26 2012 under 

certain circumstances we may increase the 600 million credit facility to 750 million based on our current credit ratings the 600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 475 basis points which represents a 10 basis point reduction to the previous 500 million revolving credit facility under a competitive bid feature and for so long as we maintain an investment grade rating we have the right under the 600 million credit facility to bid out 50 of the commitment amount and we can bid out 100 of the commitment amount once per quarter as of december 31 2009 and 2008 there was 1893 million and 0 respectively outstanding on the unsecured revolving credit facility 

 

the fannie mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 7092 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2009 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points our interest expense would increase by 60 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

 

funds from operations 

 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property premiums or original issuance costs associated with preferred stock redemptions plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo 

should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

 

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to gaap for the three years ended december 31 2009 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership units unvested restricted stock stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count 

 

re 3 is our subsidiary that focuses on development land entitlement and shortterm hold investments re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2009 shares in thousands 

 

 

 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

net loss income attributable to common stockholders 

 

2009 vs2008

same communities 

 

2009vs2008 

 

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2008 and held on december 31 2009 consisted of 33166 apartment homes and provided 76 of our total noi for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

noi for our same community properties decreased 22 or 66 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 the decrease in property noi was primarily attributable to a 20 or 88 million decrease in property rental income which was partially offset by a 16 or 23 million decrease in operating expenses the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a 29 or 129 million decrease in rental rates which was offset by an 189 or 40 million decrease in vacancy loss and an 86 or 14 million increase in reimbursement income physical occupancy slightly increased 06 to 954 and total income per occupied home decreased 30 to 1149 

 

the decrease in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 13 or 568000 decrease in real estate taxes due to favorable tax appeals a 33 or 764000 decrease in repairs and maintenance and a 97 or 970000 decrease in administrative and marketing costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income decreased to 680 as compared to 681 in the comparable period in the prior year 

 

2008vs2007 

 

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2007 and held on december 31 2008 consisted of 32124 apartment homes and provided 74 of our property noi for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

noi for our same community properties increased 38 or 108 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 36 

or 148 million increase in rental revenues and other income partially offset by a 31 or 41 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 14 or 60 million increase in rental rates a 139 or 20 million increase in reimbursement income and a 769 or 43 million decrease in rental concessions physical occupancy increased 03 to 948 and total income per occupied home increased 37 to 1176 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 59 or 23 million increase in real estate taxes due to higher assessed values on our communities and favorable tax appeals in 2007 and a 54 or 17 million increase in personnel costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 683 as compared to 681 in the comparable period in the prior year 

 

nonmature communities 

 

2009vs2008 

 

the remaining 952 million and 888 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties properties classified as real estate held for disposition and condominium properties for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized noi for our developments of 105 million acquired communities of 543 million and redeveloped properties of 248 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized noi for our developments of 24 million acquired communities of 382 million redeveloped properties of 221 million and sold properties of 235 million 

 

2008vs2007 

 

the remaining 1036 million and 1965 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized noi for our developments of 75 million acquired communities of 460 million redeveloped properties of 192 million and sold properties of 250 million for the year ended december 31 2007 we recognized net operating income for our developments of 40 million acquired communities of 66 million redeveloped properties of 149 million and sold properties of 1461 million in addition in 2007 the company sold a portfolio of properties into a joint venture that we continue to manage after the transaction and as such is not deemed discontinued operations the noi from those communities was 183 million 

 

other income 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 significant amounts reflected in other income include interest income and discount amortization from an interest in a convertible debt security and fees earned for both recurring and nonrecurring items related to the company’s joint ventures for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 other income also included interest income from a note for 200 million that the company received related to the disposition of 86 properties during 2008 in may 2009 the 200 million note was paid in full for the year ended december 31 2008 interest income also included interest from uninvested 1031 proceeds the company had redeployed all 1031 proceeds by december 31 2008 

 

tax benefit for trs 

 

udr elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as trs income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 

enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date for the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized tax expense to the extent of cash taxes paid for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we recognized a benefit due to the results of operations and temporary differences associated with the trs 

 

other operating expenses 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 the increases in other operating expenses are primarily due to additional costs incurred by the company related to longterm ground leases associated with properties acquired in december 2007 and july 2008 a schedule of future obligations related to ground leases is set forth under “contractual obligations” below 

 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 105 or 264 million as compared to the comparable period in 2008 the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2009 is primarily the result of the company’s acquisition of 13 communities with 4558 apartment homes during 2008 development completions during 2009 and 2008 and additional capital expenditures as part of the company’s acquisition activity a portion of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and are typically amortized over a period of less than one year 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 21 or 55 million as compared to the comparable period in 2007 the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2008 is a result of the company’s repositioning efforts that included the sale of 86 operating communities as the properties sold in 2008 did not meet the criteria to be deemed as heldforsale the communities until late in the fourth quarter of 2007 we did not cease depreciation until that time with the proceeds from the sale the company purchased 10 billion of properties as part of our allocation of fair value associated with the purchase price we attributed 140 million to inplace leases for our multifamily communities which are generally amortized over an 11 month period during the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded 37 million of depreciation related to two properties that we had previously been marketing as condominiums and classified as heldforsale when we determined it prudent to operate these as rental properties 

 

interest expense 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 24 or 35 million as compared to 2008 this decrease is primarily due to the company’s debt repurchase activity during 2008 and 2009 during 2009 we recognized a gain of 98 million as a result of repurchasing unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of 2389 million in the open market throughout the year the gains were partially offset by 38 million of expenses related to the tender of 375 million of unsecured debt and 26 million for prepayment penalties and the writeoff of the fair market value adjustment for consolidated joint venture debt in addition the weighted average interest rate decreased from 49 in 2008 to 45 in 2009 which further reduced our interest expense the decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2009 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2009 when compared to the same period in 2008 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 211 or 390 million as compared to 2007 this decrease is primarily due to the company recognizing a gain of 263 million on debt extinguishment that was partially offset by a 42 million prepayment penalty incurred by the company in refinancing a secured debt instrument in 2008 the gain on debt extinguishment was a result of the company repurchasing unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of 2077 million in the open market throughout the year in addition the weighted average interest rate decreased from 53 in 2007 to 49 in 2008 which further reduced our interest expense the decrease 

in the weighted average interest rate during 2008 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2008 when compared to the same period in 2007 

 

general and administrative 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 general and administrative expenses decreased 156 or 74 million as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the onetime charges during 2008 listed below 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 general and administrative expenses increased 192 or 76 million as compared to 2007 the increase was due to a number of factors including the company writing off acquisitionrelated costs the company no longer pursuing a condominium strategy resulted in writing off 17 million in deferred sales charges the renegotiation andor cancellation of certain operating leases andor vendor contracts of 08 million the company cancelling a contract to acquire a presale property resulting in a charge of 17 million and the company acquiring certain contractual rights related to a joint venture resulted in the company incurring a charge of 305000 for the profit component of the contracts 

 

severance costs and other restructuring charges 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recognized 653000 of severance and restructuring charges as the company continued to consolidate our operations in highlands ranch colorado in addition we announced reductions to certain positions related to both operations and corporate staff 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 udr recognized 43 million in severance costs and other restructuring charges partly as a result of our disposition of 86 communities consisting of 25684 apartment homes as a result of a comprehensive review of the organizational structure of udr and its operations udr recorded a charge of 36 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to workforce reductions relocation costs and other related costs these charges are included in the consolidated statements of operations within the line item “severance costs and other restructuring charges” all charges were approved by management and our board of directors in october 2007 the company had a zero balance related to the 2007 charges as of december 31 2008 

 

gains on the sale of land and depreciable property 

 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 24 million 7864 million and 2391 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial while the impact of inflation primarily impacts our results through wage pressures utilities and material costs substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally enables us to compensate for any inflationary effects by increasing rents on our apartment homes although an extreme escalation in energy and food costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases we do not believe this has had a material impact on our results for the year ended december 31 2009

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to in this report as the “code” to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders annually as a qualified reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually in 2008 we declared total distributions on an adjusted basis of 211 per common share and a dividend of 089 per common share to our stockholders due to our disposition activities during 2008 which on a preadjusted dividend basis is 228 per common share inclusive of a special dividend of 096 per common share to our stockholders a detailed discussion of the special dividend and the accounting ramifications is included below under the heading “special dividend”

business objectives 

 

our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies

2008 accomplishments 

 

  

udr’s strategies and vision 

 

udr previously announced its vision to be the innovative multifamily public real estate investment of choice we identified the following strategies to guide decisionmaking and accelerated growth 

 

1 strengthen our portfolio 

 

2 continually improve operations 

 

3 maintain access to lowcost capital 

 

strengthen our portfolio 

 

udr is focused on increasing its presence in markets with favorable job formation low housing affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio decisions consider thirdparty research taking into account job growth multifamily permitting and housing affordability 

 

in 2008 udr sold a portfolio of properties in 86 communities for total consideration of approximately 17 billion this portfolio sale dramatically accelerated our transformation to focus on markets that have the best growth prospects based on favorable job formation and low singlefamily home affordability at december 31 2008 approximately 566 of the company’s same store net operating income was provided by our communities located in california washington oregon and metropolitan washington dc 

 

acquisitions 

 

during 2008 in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our portfolio udr acquired 13 communities with 4558 apartment homes at a total cost of approximately 9763 million including the assumption of secured debt in addition we purchased two parcels of land for 200 million acquired certain rights held by a joint venture partner for 15 million in a consolidated operating joint venture and acquired a retail property for 192 million udr targets apartment community acquisitions in markets where job growth expectations are above the national average home affordability is low and the demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing is favorable 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

 

  

the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and our yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  

 

 

 

dispositions 

 

we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio during 2008 as a major step in our portfolio repositioning we sold 25684 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets specifically arkansas delaware ohio and south carolina in an effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions 

 

factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

 

 4 

 

development activities 

 

the following wholly owned projects were under development as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

redevelopment activities 

 

during 2008 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value major renovations totaled 518 million or 1123 per average stabilized home for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

joint venture activities 

 

during 2008 we completed the development of an apartment community located in marina del rey ca with 298 apartment homes and a carrying value of 1393 million the apartment community is currently in leaseup in december 2008 we acquired our joint venture partner’s interest in their profit participation and terminated the property management agreement that had approximately two years remaining on the preexisting contract 

 

the company has the following unconsolidated joint venture project under development as of december 31 2008 based on udr’s 49 ownership interest 

 

 

 

the company is also a partner in a joint venture to develop another site in bellevue washington upon formation of the joint venture we owned 49 of the entity that proposes to develop a 430 home highrise apartment building with ground floor retail space the project is ongoing and will commence construction once favorable financing has been obtained 

 

udr through unconsolidated joint ventures owns 4862 apartment homes with ownership percentages ranging from 20 to 49 of which 4158 are operating and 704 are under development our total equity investment at december 31 2008 was 470 million for additional information see note 4 “joint ventures” of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

continually improve operations 

 

udr is committed to improving operations through automation and enhancing the customer’s experience since adopting our new corporate strategies udr has outsourced a call center and created myudr our resident services portal on our website udr customers have access to conduct business with us 24 hours a day 7 days a week to pay rent on line and to submit a service request through transforming operations and engaging technology our residents get the convenience they want and our operating teams become more efficient 

 

in 2008 udr continually enhanced wwwudrcom and individual community websites deploying an innovative 3d interactive photo viewer customized version of the apartment selector program and special views or photos that feature specific apartment homes that commands an excellent view from the apartment floor plans and availability in addition to udrcom improvements we also launched a quick response 2d bar code program that can be used on most mobile devices an industry first iphone apartment search website was launched and we established a social media website presence in myspacecom these enhancements have increased overall web visitor traffic to over 14 million visitors and more than 10 million organic search engine visitors which contributed to a 15 yearoveryear lead stream increase 

 

previously udr launched a new spanishlanguage site marketing to latinos the nation’s fastestgrowing ethnic group the site offers over 4000 spanish translated web pages and includes apartments for rent search resources the website can be found at httpesudrcom and can also be found on any webenabled mobile device 

 

maintaining access to lowcost capital 

 

we seek to maintain a capital structure that allows us to seek and not just react to opportunities available in the marketplace we have structured our borrowings to layer our debt maturities and to be able to access both secured and unsecured debt 

 

special dividend 

 

on november 5 2008 our board of directors declared a dividend on a preadjusted basis of 129 per share approximately 1760 million or 119 per share on an adjusted basis payable to holders of our common stock “the special dividend” the special dividend was paid on january 29 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9 2008 the dividend represented the company’s fourth quarter recurring preadjusted distribution of 033 per share 0305 per share on an adjusted basis and an additional special distribution in the preadjusted amount of 096 per share 089 per share on an adjusted basis due to taxable income arising from our dispositions occurring during the year subject to the company’s right to pay the entire special dividend in cash stockholders had the option to make an election to receive payment in cash or in shares however the aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders other than cash payable in lieu of fractional shares would not be less than 440 million 

 

the special dividend totaling 1771 million was paid on 137266557 preadjusted shares issued and outstanding on the record date approximately 1331 million of the special dividend was paid through the issuance of 11358042 shares of common stock which was determined based on the volume weighted average closing sales price of our common stock of 1171 per share on the nyse on january 21 2009 and january 22 2009 the effect of the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the special dividend was retroactively reflected in each of the historical periods presented within this report as if those shares were issued and outstanding at the beginning of the earliest period presented accordingly all activity including share issuances repurchases and forfeitures have been adjusted to reflect the 827 increase in the number of shares except where otherwise noted 

financing activities 

 

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2008 

 

  

markets and competitive conditions 

 

upon completion of our dispositions activity approximately 566 of the company’s same store net operating income was generated from apartment homes located in markets of california oregon washington and metropolitan washington dc we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

 

competition for new residents is generally intense across all of our markets some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds public and private real estate companies investment companies and other public and private apartment reits and our competitors may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

 7 

 

  

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the alignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement in spite of the difficult economic environment 

 

communities 

 

at december 31 2008 our apartment portfolio included 161 whollyowned communities having a total of 44388 completed apartment homes and an additional 2242 under development the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and our upgrade and rehabilitation programs the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore should result in increased cash flow 

 

same community comparison 

 

we believe that one pertinent qualitative measurement of the performance of our portfolio is tracking the results of our same store community’s net operating income “noi” which is total rental revenue less rental expenses excluding property management and other operating expenses our same store population are operating communities which we own and have stabilized occupancy revenues and expenses as of the beginning of the prior year for the year ended december 31 2008 our same store noi increased by 108 million or 38 compared to the prior year the increase in noi for the 32124 apartment homes which make up the same store population was driven by an increase in revenues and physical occupancy at our communities 

 

revenue growth in 2009 may be impacted by general adverse conditions affecting the economy reduced occupancy rates increased rental concessions increased bad debt and other factors which may adversely impact our ability to increase rents 

 

tax matters 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

inflation 

 

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents to provide an attractive hedge against inflation 

 

environmental matters 

 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

 

insurance 

 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made 

 

risks related to our real estate investments and our operations 

 

unfavorable apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels rental revenues and the value of our real estate assets unfavorable market conditions in the areas in which we operate and unfavorable economic conditions generally may significantly affect our occupancy levels our rental rates and collections the value of the properties and our ability to strategically acquire or dispose of apartment communities on economically favorable terms some of our major expenses including mortgage payments and real estate taxes generally do not decline when related rents decline we would expect that declines in our occupancy levels rental revenues andor the values of our apartment communities would cause us to have less cash available to pay our indebtedness and to distribute to our stockholders which could adversely affect our financial condition and the market value of our securities factors that may affect our occupancy levels our rental revenues andor the value of our properties include the following among others 

 

 12 

 

we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities which could limit our operational and financial flexibility we have periodically disposed of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives which may in turn have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities 

 

  

we may not have access to proceeds obtained from the sale of apartment communities  a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable 

 

competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and the failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies we have selectively acquired in the past and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to selectively acquire in the future apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

 13 

  

we do not expect to acquire apartment communities at the rate we have in prior years which may limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and the market value of our securities in the past other real estate investors including insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits have competed with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties and such competition in the future may make it more difficult for us to pursue attractive investment opportunities on favorable terms which could adversely affect growth 

 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability in the past we have selectively pursued the development and construction of apartment communities and we intend to do so in the future as appropriate opportunities arise development activities have been and in the future may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks 

 

  

in some cases in the past the costs of upgrading acquired communities exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

 

some potential losses may not be adequately covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program in addition we will sustain losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

 

if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our 

significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we have acquired in the past and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise apartment communities that are outside of our existing market entering into new markets may expose us to a variety of risks and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 

  

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our debt interest and general and administrative expenses as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rental rates 

 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures if we use such a structure we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect net operating income and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather events certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults mudslides and fires and others where there are hurricanes tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses that may be greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

 

actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

 

our success depends on our senior management our success depends upon the retention of our senior management whose continued service in not guaranteed we may not be able to find qualified replacements for the individuals who make up our senior management if their services should no longer be available to us the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

  

expenses associated with our investment in an apartment community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

 

debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

 

financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions recently domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty while this condition has occurred most visibly within the “subprime” mortgage lending sector of the credit market liquidity has tightened in overall domestic financial markets including the investment grade debt and equity capital markets consequently there is greater risk that the financial institutions we do business with could experience disruptions that would negatively affect our ability to obtain financing 

 

disruptions in financial markets may adversely impact availability and cost of credit impact our tenant base and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our stock our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance debt obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors beyond our control the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets making terms for certain financings less attractive and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for acquisitions development of our properties and other purposes at reasonable terms which may negatively affect our business additionally due 

to this uncertainty we may be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common or preferred stock the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

 

prospective buyers of our properties may also experience difficulty in obtaining debt financing which might make it more difficult for us to sell properties at acceptable pricing levels current tightening of credit in financial markets and increasing unemployment may also adversely affect the ability of tenants to meet their lease obligations and for us to continue increasing rents on a prospective basis disruptions in the credit and financial markets may also have other adverse effects on us and the overall economy 

 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions including lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about financial institutions or the financial services industry generally could result in losses or defaults by these institutions in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 3457 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 105 of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

 

risks related to tax laws 

 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws 

governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

reits may pay a portion of dividends in common stock in december 2008 the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 200868 providing temporary guidance that assists publicly traded reits in satisfying their taxrelated distribution requirements while conserving cash this temporary guidance is intended to permit reits to limit cash distributions in order to maintain liquidity during the current downturn in economic conditions under this guidance effective january 1 2008 and ending on or before december 31 2009 the internal revenue service will treat a distribution of stock by a publicly traded reit pursuant to certain elections to receive stock or cash as a taxable distribution of property the amount of such stock distribution will be treated as equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead the guidance permits reits to limit the aggregate amount of cash available to stockholders pursuant to the election to 10 of the aggregate distribution of cash and stock taken together if we pay a portion of our dividends in shares of our common stock pursuant to this temporary guidance our stockholders may receive less cash than they received in distributions in prior years and the market value of our securities may decline 

 

we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

 

reit distribution requirements limit our available cash as a reit we are subject to annual distribution requirements which limit the amount of cash we retain for other business purposes including amounts to fund our growth we generally must distribute annually at least 90 of our net reit taxable income excluding any net capital gain in order for our distributed earnings not to be subject to corporate income tax we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the code however differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a shortterm or longterm basis to meet the 90 distribution requirement of the code 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction and subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment 

purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

 

we could face possible state and local tax audits and adverse changes in state and local tax laws as discussed in the risk factors above because we are organized and qualify as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income taxes but we are subject to certain state and local taxes from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we own apartment communities may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes if such changes occur we may be required to pay additional state and local taxes these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and the amount of cash available for the payment of distributions to our stockholders in the normal course of business entities through which we own real estate may also become subject to tax audits if such entities become subject to state or local tax audits the ultimate result of such audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

 

risks related to our organization and our shares 

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of 

delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests

the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as 

determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes we routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain operating investing financing and other activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for debt repayment investing and financing activities 

 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development properties and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities dividends and budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from cash provided by our unsecured revolving credit facility other debt and equity issuances and cash flows provided by property operations 

 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities guarantees of debt securities warrants subscription rights purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of the financing activity 

 

future capital needs 

 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from construction loans the sale of property our unsecured revolving credit facility and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt 

 

during 2009 we have approximately 1461 million of secured debt and 2501 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities proceeds from our note receivable the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity or from disposition proceeds we also anticipate using contractually provided extensions for secured debt 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations as well as involves some degree of uncertainty estimates are prepared based on management’s assessment after considering all evidence available changes in estimates could affect our financial position or results of operations below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our financial condition or results of operations where there is uncertainty or requires significant judgment 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in conformity with gaap we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

 

during 2008 1310 million or 2838 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development condominium conversions and commercial properties compared to 1944 million or 2829 per home spent in 2007 these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as roofs siding parking lots and asset preservation capital expenditures which aggregated 291 million or 630 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades upgrades to hvac equipment 

and other extensive exteriorinterior upgrades totaled 501 million or 1085 per home and major renovations totaled 518 million or 1123 per home for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development condominium conversions and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

 

 

we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2009 are currently expected to be approximately 675 per home 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

 

real estate investment properties 

 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

 

reit status 

 

we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reit a reit is a legal entity that holds interests in real estate and is required by the code to meet a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that a reit must distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders if we were to fail to qualify 

as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at the regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four years based on the net earnings reported for the year ended december 31 2008 in our consolidated statements of operations we would have incurred 2848 million in federal and state gaap income taxes if we had failed to qualify as a reit 

 

statements of cash flow 

 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided byused in investing and financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 1798 million compared to 2693 million for 2007 during 2008 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from a reduction in property operating income from our apartment community portfolio the reduction was driven by the company completing the sale of a significant component of our portfolio in the first quarter of 2008 a portion of the proceeds from the disposition were reinvested in subsequent quarters which diluted the net cash provided by operations for the period in which the company held restricted 1031 cash funds in lieu of revenue generating operating communities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2693 million compared to 2379 million for 2006 during 2007 the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from the increase in property operating income from the company’s portfolio performing well on a same community basis for revenues and noi 

 

investing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 net cash provided by investing activities was 3023 million compared to net cash used of 901 million for 2007 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to acquisitions capital expenditures development and disposition activities as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail throughout this report 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash used in investing activities was 901 million compared to 1582 million for 2006 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities 

 

acquisitions 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we acquired 13 apartment communities with 4558 apartment homes two parcels of land and one retail property for aggregate consideration of 10 billion our longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been expanding our interests in communities located in california florida metropolitan washington dc and the washington markets over the past years prospectively we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including favorable job formation and low housing affordability 

the following whollyowned communities were acquired during the year ended december 31 2008  dollars in thousands  

 

 

 

  

  

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 we acquired 13 apartment communities with 2671 apartment homes six parcels of land and an interest in an operating joint venture for an aggregate consideration of 4865 million in 2006 we acquired eight apartment communities with 2763 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 3275 million and two parcels of land for 199 million 

 

real estate under development 

 

at december 31 2008 our development pipeline for whollyowned communities totaled 2407 homes with a budget of 3759 million in which we have a carrying value of 1868 million we expect to have the first of the communities complete development during 2009 in addition we own several parcels of land held for future development in which the company is seeking entitlements and preparing for development although we do not anticipate development to commence during 2009 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we invested approximately 1601 million in development projects an increase of 586 million from our 2007 level of 1015 million as a result of our investment in developments we completed development on two whollyowned communities with 644 apartment homes that have a carrying value of 444 million and acquired three presale communities with 820 apartment homes that have a carrying value of 1264 million during the year ended december 31 2008 

 

consolidated development joint venture 

 

in 2006 we entered into a joint venture to develop an apartment community with 298 apartment homes in marina del rey california our initial investment was 275 million our joint venture partner was the managing partner as well as the developer general contractor and property manager in december 2008 we acquired for 15 million our joint venture partner’s interest in their profit participation and terminated the property management agreement that had approximately two years remaining on the preexisting contract as a result of terminating our arrangement the company recorded a charge to earnings of 305000 as the profit component related to the management agreement and capitalized the balance as part of the investment in real estate which will be depreciated over the average remaining life of the tangible asset as of december 31 2008 this property is included as a component of our whollyowned communities 

unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

udr is a partner in a joint venture to develop a site in bellevue washington at closing we owned 49 of the project that involves building a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground floor retail the project is currently ongoing and will commence construction once market conditions improve and favorable financing has been obtained our investment at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 102 million and 81 million respectively 

 

udr is a partner in a joint venture which will develop 274 apartment homes in the central business district of bellevue washington construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2009 at closing we owned 49 of the project our investment at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 99 million and 89 million respectively 

 

in january 2007 we entered into a joint venture which owns and operates a recently completed 23story 166 apartment home high rise community in the central business district of bellevue washington at closing udr owned 49 of the project our investment at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 104 million and 112 million respectively 

 

in november 2007 udr and an institutional unaffiliated partner formed a joint venture which owns and operates various apartment communities located in texas on the closing date udr sold nine operating properties consisting of 3690 units and contributed one property under development to the joint venture the property under development has 302 units and was completed in the third quarter of 2008 and commenced lease up at that time udr contributed cash and property equal to 20 of the fair value of the properties the unaffiliated partner contributed cash equal to 80 of the fair value of the properties comprising the venture which was then used to purchase the nine operating properties from udr our investment at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 165 million and 201 million respectively in addition during 2008 we received payment in full of a note receivable of 188 million from the joint venture 

 

disposition of investments 

 

during the year ended december 31 2008 udr sold 86 communities with a total of 25684 apartment homes for gross consideration of 17 billion 53 condominiums from two communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of 69 million one parcel of land for gross proceeds of 16 million and one commercial property for gross proceeds of 65 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 7864 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to acquire new communities and reduce debt during 2008 we decided to discontinue sales of units with the two communities identified for condominium conversion until such time that the market conditions turn favorable and it is economically beneficial to sell those units versus operate the residual 525 units of those communities as a result of our decision to revert the remaining units to operations the company recorded a charge to earnings of 17 million excluding the catch up for depreciation on the units when they were returned to operations 

 

as a result of our disposition activities in 2008 the company declared a special dividend payable to holders of our common stock for 096 per share included with our recurring distribution for the company’s fourth quarter of 2008 for a total of 129 per share 119 per share in the aggregate adjusted for the special dividend payable on january 29 2009 to stockholders of record on december 9 2008 additional information regarding the special dividend is set forth in item 1 business in part 1 of this report 

 

in conjunction with the transaction in which we sold 86 communities for 17 billion we received a note in the amount of 2000 million the note which is secured by a pledge security agreement and a guarantee from the buyer’s parent entity bears interest at the rate of 75 per annum and matures on march 31 2014 provided however that the master credit facility agreement pursuant to which the buyer financed the acquisition of the properties provides that the buyer will pay or prepay the note on or before the date that is fourteen 14 months after the initial closing date may 3 2009 and further that it is an event of default under the master credit facility agreement if the note is not paid in full by june 1 2009 

for the year ended december 31 2007 udr sold 21 communities with a total of 7125 apartment homes for gross consideration of 7292 million one parcel of land for 45 million and contributed one property under development at cost to a joint venture arrangement in texas in addition we sold 61 condominiums from two communities with a total of 640 condominiums for gross consideration of 104 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 2391 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

 

financing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 our net cash used in financing activities was 4725 million compared to 1781 million for the comparable period of 2007 

 

the following significant financing activity occurred during the year ended december 31 2008 

 

  

for the year ended december 31 2007 our net cash used in financing activities was 1781 million compared to 930 million for the comparable period of 2006 the increase in financing activities was due to the company repaying additional secured debt the redemption of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock repurchase of common stock in the marketplace which was offset by the issuance of issuance of debt and equity securities and drawing down on our unsecured credit facility 

credit facilities 

 

as of december 31 2008 we have secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 10 billion with 8312 million outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of 10 years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we have 6666 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 55 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 31 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 7489 million with 6639 million outstanding the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we had 5831 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 59 and the remaining balance on these facilities was at a weighted average variable rate of 51 

 

on july 27 2007 we amended and restated our existing threeyear 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of may 31 2008 which could be extended for an additional year at our option to increase the facility to 600 million and to extend its maturity to july 26 2012 under certain circumstances we may increase the new 600 million credit facility to 750 million based on our current credit ratings the 600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 475 basis points which represents a 10 basis point reduction to the previous 500 million revolving credit facility under a competitive bid feature and for so long as we maintain an investment grade rating we have the right under the new 600 million credit facility to bid out 50 of the commitment amount and we can bid out 100 of the commitment amount once per quarter as of december 31 2008 and 2007 there was 0 and 3095 million respectively outstanding on the unsecured revolving credit facility 

 

the fannie mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt we had 3457 million in variable rate debt that is not subject to interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2008 if market interest rates for variable rate debt increased by 100 basis point our interest expense would increase by 38 million based on the average balance outstanding during the year 

 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

 

funds from operations 

 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property 

acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property premiums or original issuance costs associated with preferred stock redemptions plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

 

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to gaap for the three years ended december 31 2008 adjusted for the special dividend dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership units convertible debt and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count 

re 3 is our subsidiary that focuses on development land entitlement and shortterm hold investments re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with re3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information adjusted for the special dividend to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2008 shares in thousands 

 

 

 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on gaap is as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

net income available to common stockholders 

 

2008 vs2007 

 

net income available to common stockholders was 6978 million 495 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2052 million 141 per diluted share for the comparable period in the prior year after adjustment for the special dividend the increase in net income available to common 

stockholders for the year ended december 31 2008 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

  

the increases to our net income available to common stockholders were offset by a reduction in property noi of 802 million due to our dispositions an increase in minority interest of 347 million and an increase in general and administrative expense of 76 million when compared to 2007 

 

2007vs2006 

 

net income available to common stockholders was 2052 million 141 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 1132 million 078 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2006 after adjustment for the special dividend the increase for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared to the same period in 2006 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

  

these increases in income were partially offset by a 136 million increase in real estate depreciation and amortization expense an 84 million increase in general and administrative expense 43 million in severance costs and other restructuring charges in 2007 23 million in premiums on preferred stock repurchases in 2007 and a 09 million decrease in nonproperty income during 2007 when compared to 2006 

 

apartment community operations 

 

our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total apartment portfolio which excludes commercial operating income for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 40 

 

the following table is our reconciliation of property noi to net income as reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

same communities 2008vs2007 

 

our same store communities those acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2007 and held on december 31 2008 which consisted of 32124 apartment homes and provided 74 of our property noi for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

noi for our same community properties increased 38 or 108 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the increase in property noi was primarily attributable to a 36 or 148 million increase in rental revenues and other income partially offset by a 31 or 41 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 14 or 60 million increase in rental rates a 139 or 20 million increase in reimbursement income and a 769 or 43 million decrease in rental concessions physical occupancy increased 03 to 948 and total income per occupied home increased 37 to 1176 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 59 or 23 million increase in real estate taxes due to higher assessed values on our communities and favorable tax appeals in 2007 and a 54 or 17 million increase in personnel costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property net operating income divided by property rental income increased to 683 as compared to 681 in the comparable period in the prior year 

 

2007vs2006 

 

our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2006 and held on december 31 2007 which consisted of 30686 apartment homes provided 57 of our property net operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

same community property net operating income increased 70 or 177 million compared to 2006 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 50 or 188 million increase in revenues from rental and other income and a 09 or 11 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 42 or 162 million increase in 

rental rates an 114 or 30 million increase in reimbursement income and fee income and a 162 or 10 million decrease in rental concessions these increases were partially offset by a 68 or 13 million increase in vacancy loss physical occupancy decreased 02 to 946 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 52 or 18 million increase in real estate taxes that was partially offset by a 76 or 08 million decrease in administrative and marketing costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income increased 13 to 682 

 

nonmature communities 2008vs2007 

 

the remaining 1036 million and 1965 million of our noi during the year ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist of communities that do not meet the criteria to be included in same communities which includes communities developed or acquired redevelopment properties sold properties properties classified as real estate held for disposition and condominium properties for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized noi for our developments of 75 million acquired communities of 460 million redeveloped properties of 192 million and sold properties of 250 million for the year ended december 31 2007 we recognized net operating income for our developments of 40 million acquired communities of 66 million redeveloped properties of 149 million and sold properties of 1461 million in addition in 2007 the company sold a portfolio of properties into a joint venture that we continue to manage after the transaction and as such is not deemed discontinued operations the noi from those communities was 183 million 

 

2007vs2006 

 

the nonmature communities net operating income for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 is derived largely from acquisitions developments redevelopments and dispositions as the company executed our strategy to enhance our portfolio in high barriertoentry markets 

 

other income 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 significant amounts reflected in other income include interest income from a note for 200 million that the company received related to the disposition of 86 properties during 2008 interest from uninvested 1031 proceeds and fees earned for both recurring and nonrecurring items related to the company’s joint ventures at december 31 2008 the company had redeployed all 1031 proceeds 

 

tax benefit for trs 

 

udr elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries “trs” income taxes for our trs are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we have recognized a benefit due to the results of operations and temporary differences associated with the trs 

 

other operating expenses 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in other operating expenses is primarily due to additional costs incurred by the company related to ground leases in december 2007 and in july 2008 we 

purchased operating communities that were subject to longterm ground leases a schedule of future obligations related to ground leases is set forth under “contractual obligations” below 

 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 21 or 55 million as compared to the comparable period in 2007 the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31 2008 is a result of the company’s repositioning efforts that included the sale of 86 operating communities as the properties sold in 2008 did not meet the criteria to be deemed as heldforsale the communities until late in the fourth quarter of 2008 we did not cease depreciation until that time with the proceeds from the sale the company purchased 10 billion of properties as part of our allocation of fair value associated with the purchase price we attributed 140 million to inplace leases for our multifamily communities which are generally amortized over an 11 month period during the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded 37 million of depreciation related to two properties that we had previously been marketing as condominiums and classified as heldforsale when we determined it prudent to operate the communities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 136 million or 56 compared to 2006 primarily due to the significant increase in per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and other capital expenditures 

 

interest expense 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 237 or 421 million as compared to 2007 this decrease is primarily due to the company recognizing a gain of 296 million on debt extinguishment that was partially offset by a 42 million prepayment penalty incurred by the company in refinancing a secured debt instrument in 2008 the gain on debt extinguishment was a result of the company repurchasing unsecured debt securities with a notional amount of 2077 million in the open market throughout the year in addition the weighted average interest rate decreased from 53 in 2007 to 49 in 2008 which further reduced our interest expense the decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2008 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2008 when compared to the same period in 2007 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 17 or 32 million compared to 2006 for the year ended december 31 2007 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 59 or 1938 million compared to 2006 and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 54 in 2006 to 53 in 2007 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2007 was slightly higher than 2006 as acquisition costs in 2007 have been funded primarily by the issuance of debt the decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2007 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had lower interest rates in 2007 when compared to the same period in 2006 

 

general and administrative 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 general and administrative expenses increased 192 or 76 million as compared to 2007 the increase was due to a number of factors including the company writing off acquisitionrelated costs the company no longer pursuing a condominium strategy resulted in writing off 17 million in deferred sales charges the renegotiation andor cancellation of certain operating leases andor vendor contracts of 08 million the company cancelling a contract to acquire a presale property resulting in a charge of 17 million and the company acquiring certain contractual rights related to a joint venture resulted in the company incurring a charge of 305000 for the profit component of the contracts 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 general and administrative expenses increased 84 million or 268 compared to 2006 the increase was due to a number of factors including increases in personnel costs incentive compensation and legal and professional fees 

severance costs and other restructuring charges 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recognized 653000 of severance and restructuring charges as the company continued to consolidate our operations in highlands ranch colorado in addition we announced reductions to certain positions related to both operations and corporate 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 udr recognized 43 million in severance costs and other restructuring charges partly as a result of our disposition of 86 communities consisting of 25684 apartment homes as a result of a comprehensive review of the organizational structure of udr and its operations udr recorded a charge of 36 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 related to workforce reductions relocation costs and other related costs these charges are included in the consolidated statements of operations within the line item “severance costs and other restructuring charges” all charges were approved by management and our board of directors in october 2007 the company had a zero balance related to the 2007 charges as of december 31 2008 

 

gains on the sale of land and depreciable property 

 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 7864 million 2391 million and 1403 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

udr has entered into one contract to purchase an apartment community of 289 homes in dallas texas for approximately 290 million upon completion of its development this apartment community is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

other than the purchase contract listed above we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

business objectives 

 

our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

  

2007 accomplishments 

 

 2 

 

  

udr’s strategies and vision 

 

in the first quarter of 2007 udr announced its vision to be the innovative multifamily real estate investment of choice we identified four strategies to guide decisionmaking and accelerated growth 

 

1 strengthen our portfolio 

 

2 expand re 3 

 

3 transform operations 

 

4 source lowcost capital 

 

strengthen our portfolio 

 

udr is focused on increasing its presence in markets with strong job growth low housing affordability and a favorable demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing portfolio decisions consider thirdparty research taking into account job growth multifamily permitting and housing affordability in january 2008 udr announced that it has entered into a contract to sell 25684 apartment homes in 86 communities for 17 billion the transaction is expected to close on or about march 3 2008 at which time udr will receive 15 billion in cash and a note in the principal amount of 200 million the note matures on the same date as the buyer’s senior financing may be prepaid 14 months from the date of the note bears interest at a fixed rate of 75 per annum and is secured by a pledge and security agreement and a guarantee closing is subject to customary closing conditions upon completion of the transaction udr will own 40183 homes in 148 communities 

 

this portfolio sale dramatically accelerates udr’s transformation to focus on markets that have the best growth prospects based on favorable job formation and low singlefamily home affordability upon completion of the sale udr expects that approximately 90 of its net operating income will be generated from homes located in markets on the pacific coast the virginiawashington dc corridor and florida 

 

acquisitions 

 

during 2007 in conjunction with our strategy to strengthen our portfolio udr acquired 13 communities with 2671 apartment homes at a total cost of approximately 4041 million including the assumption of secured debt in addition we purchased six parcels of land for 707 million and invested 118 million in an operating joint venture udr is targeting apartment community acquisitions in markets where job growth expectations are above the national average home affordability is low and the demandsupply ratio for multifamily housing is favorable 

 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

 

 3 

 

  

the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and our yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  

 

 

 

dispositions 

 

we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio during 2007 we sold over 7000 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets specifically colorado and georgia in an effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions 

 

factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

 

  

at december 31 2007 we had 86 communities with a total of 25684 apartment homes two communities with a total of 579 condominiums and one commercial unit classified as real estate held for disposition in january 2008 udr announced that it had entered into a contract in the fourth quarter of 2007 to sell 25684 apartment homes in 86 communities for 17 billion 

 

expanding re 3 

 

re 3 is our subsidiary that focuses on development land entitlement and shortterm hold investments we expanded its development and redevelopment pipelines through a variety of activities at december 31 2007 udr’s total development pipeline totaled over 16600 homes with a budget over 27 billion 

 

our wholly owned under development pipeline stands at 6386 homes with a budgeted cost of 10 billion of which 3234 homes in five communities are under construction and the remaining 3152 homes will be built on 12 land sites an additional 1594 homes budgeted at 244 million are completed developments or developments in progress in a presale contracttopurchase program our completed redevelopment and redevelopment pipeline stands at 2956 homes with a budgeted cost of 150 million our future development pipeline of owned properties provides for construction of an additional 4419 homes budgeted at 848 million and the remaining 1304 homes with a budgeted cost of 395 million comprise our interest in one consolidated development joint venture and three unconsolidated joint ventures 

development activities 

 

the following wholly owned projects were under development as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

the first phase of the addison assemblage will deliver 684 homes in the third quarter of 2010 

 

in addition we owned 12 parcels of land held for future development aggregating 1245 million at december 31 2007 

 

redevelopment activities 

 

during 2007 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2007 we spent 1944 million or 2829 per home on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development condominium conversions and commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as roofs siding parking lots and asset preservation capital expenditures which aggregated 444 million or 646 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades upgrades to hvac equipment and other extensive exteriorinterior upgrades totaled 782 million or 1138 per home and major renovations totaled 718 million or 1045 per home for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

joint venture activities 

 

the following consolidated joint venture project was under development as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

the following unconsolidated joint venture projects were under development as of december 31 2007 

 

 

udr owns a 20 interest in a joint venture to which udr sold nine operating properties consisting of 3690 homes and contributed lincoln town square ii as noted above in addition udr owns a 49 interest in an operating joint venture which owns and operates a recently completed 23story 166 apartment home high rise community in bellevue wa 

 

transforming operations 

 

during 2007 udr has been committed to growing net operating income through automation and improving the ease of doing business with us since adopting our new corporate strategies udr selected and began to deploy yieldstar revenue management software launched a newly redesigned customeroriented web site with better features and improved the quality of our photos on the web the new wwwudrcom web site features sidebyside apartment and floor plan comparisons enhanced mapping additional pricing options 360 degree virtual tours a furniture arrangement feature mobile web site access and clicktochat and clicktocall for online support in the first month following the launch udr experienced the highest unique visitor traffic in its history 

 

udr also launched a new spanishlanguage site marketing to latinos the nation’s fastestgrowing ethnic group the site offers over 4000 spanish translated web pages and includes apartments for rent search resources the website can be found at httpesudrcom and can also be found on any webenabled mobile device 

 

these enhancements have increased traffic and reduced administrative and marketing costs as we implemented internet initiatives and technology solutions to drive traffic from low cost or no cost sources as a result customer acquisition costs have been reduced significantly 

 

sourcing lowcost capital 

 

during 2007 udr established a 650 million joint venture with a large domestic institutional partner the venture owns a portfolio of 3690 stabilized homes located in nine multifamily communities in austin dallas and houston texas and another 302 homes currently under development in dallas texas in addition to this 350 million initial pool of assets the joint venture contains a 300 million expansion feature for future acquisitions at closing the venture secured a 232 million seven year interest only mortgage which is recourse only to the properties and bears interest at a rate of 561 per annum the venture secured a commitment for a loan in the principal amount of 217 million to replace construction financing on an apartment community under development the takeout loan provides for interest only bears interest at 555 per annum and will have a term of 6 years udr realized proceeds of 3262 million for the properties and we hold a 20 interest in the venture in addition to the upfront proceeds udr has the opportunity for future proceeds after certain irr hurdles are achieved 

 

financing activities 

 

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2007 

 

 6 

  

  

markets and competitive conditions 

 

upon completion of the portfolio sale announced in january 2008 we expect that approximately 90 of our net operating income will be generated from homes located in markets on the pacific coast the virginiawashington dc corridor and florida we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

 

in many of our markets competition for new residents is intense some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

  

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement 

 

communities 

 

at december 31 2007 our apartment portfolio included 234 communities having a total of 65867 completed apartment homes the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and our upgrade and rehabilitation program the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore should result in increased cash flow 

 

same community comparison 

 

same community property net operating income increased 70 or 177 million compared to 2006 the increase in property net operating income was primarily attributable to a 50 or 188 million increase in 

revenues from rental and other income and a 09 or 11 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 42 or 162 million increase in rental rates an 114 or 30 million increase in reimbursement income and fee income and a 162 or 10 million decrease in rental concessions these increases were partially offset by a 68 or 13 million increase in vacancy loss physical occupancy decreased 02 to 946 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 52 or 18 million increase in real estate taxes that was partially offset by a 76 or 08 million decrease in administrative and marketing costs 

 

customers 

 

our upgrade and rehabilitation programs enable us to raise rents and attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities 

 

tax matters 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders annually provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders annually even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

 

inflation 

 

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents to provide an attractive hedge against inflation 

 

environmental matters 

 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of 

which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

 

insurance 

 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made 

 

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following 

 

 13 

 

the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism at the same time productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy continued weakness in job creation or any worsening of current economic conditions generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders 

 

new acquisitions developments and condominium projects may not achieve anticipated results we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium projects our acquisition development and condominium activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

  

possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable 

 

increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so in 

addition our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a requirement to repay our indebtedness prior to its maturity which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and increase our financing costs 

 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

  

expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

 

debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

 15 

 

  

construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

 

some potential losses are not covered by insurance we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance accordingly we may sustain uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

 

we may not be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold or if offered these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 

  

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 5221 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 15 of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses and increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

 

limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely 

pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely affect our growth 

 

failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability 

 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must 

comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures if we use such a structure we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

 

compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings including our properties be made accessible to disabled persons noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants from time to time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under this act if under the americans with disabilities act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements if we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

risk of damage from catastrophic weather events certain of our communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults mudslides and fires and others where there are hurricanes tornadoes or risks of other inclement weather the adverse weather events could cause damage or losses greater than insured levels in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits we could lose our capital invested in the affected community as well as anticipated future revenue from that community we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations 

 

insurance coverage for such catastrophic events is expensive due to limited industry capacity as a result we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available 

 

terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results further our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack in addition the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal report over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other 

reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests

business overview 

 

we are a real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages apartment communities nationwide we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships heritage communities lp a delaware limited partnership and united dominion realty lp a delaware limited partnership unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “udr” refer collectively to udr inc and its subsidiaries 

at december 31 2007 our portfolio included 234 communities with 65867 apartment homes nationwide the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets includes real estate held for disposition real estate under development and land but excludes commercial properties 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital 

management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes we routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities 

 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities we believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and longterm likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations 

 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities warrants purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

 

future capital needs 

 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of property with construction loans through joint ventures the use of our unsecured revolving credit facility and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties 

 

during 2008 we have approximately 117 million of secured debt and 2759 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity or from disposition proceeds 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates these policies include those related to 1 capital expenditures 2 impairment of longlived assets and 3 real estate investment properties with respect to these critical accounting policies we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

 

during 2007 1944 million or 2829 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development condominium conversions and commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as roofs siding parking lots and asset preservation capital expenditures which aggregated 444 million or 646 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades upgrades to hvac equipment and other extensive exteriorinterior upgrades totaled 782 million or 

1138 per home and major renovations totaled 718 million or 1045 per home for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development condominium conversions and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

 

 

total capital expenditures for our communities decreased 213 million or 167 per home for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 this decrease was attributable to a 659 million decrease in revenue enhancing improvements at certain of our properties that was offset by an additional 98 million being invested in recurring capital expenditures and an additional 348 million being invested in major renovations as compared to the same period in 2006 we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2008 are currently expected to be approximately 650 per home 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

 

real estate investment properties 

 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

statements of cash flow 

 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing and financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2506 million compared to 2296 million for 2006 during 2007 the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from the increase in property operating income from our apartment community portfolio see discussion under “apartment community operations” 

 

investing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 net cash used in investing activities was 714 million compared to 1500 million for 2006 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail below 

 

acquisitions 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 we acquired 13 apartment communities with 2671 apartment homes six parcels of land and one operating joint venture for an aggregate consideration of 4865 million in 2006 we acquired eight apartment communities with 2763 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 3275 million and two parcels of land for 199 million our longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been expanding our interests in the fast growing southern california florida and metropolitan washington dc markets over the past years during 2008 we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including favorable job formation and low singlefamily home affordability 

 

real estate under development 

 

development activity is focused in core markets in which we have strong operations in place for the year ended december 31 2007 we invested approximately 1013 million in development projects a decrease of 05 million from our 2006 level of 1018 million 

 

the following wholly owned projects were under development as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

the first phase of the addison assemblage will deliver 684 homes in the third quarter of 2010 

 

in addition we owned 12 parcels of land held for future development aggregating 1245 million at december 31 2007 

consolidated development joint venture 

 

in june 2006 we completed the formation of a development joint venture that will invest approximately 138 million to develop one apartment community with 298 apartment homes in marina del rey california udr is the financial partner and is responsible for funding the costs of development and receives a preferred return from 7 to 85 before our partner receives a 50 participation our initial investment was 275 million under fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” this venture has been consolidated into udr’s financial statements our joint venture partner is the managing partner as well as the developer general contractor and property manager 

 

the following consolidated joint venture project was under development as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

udr is a partner in a joint venture to develop a site in bellevue washington at closing we owned 49 of the project that involves building a 430 home high rise apartment building with ground floor retail our investment at december 31 2007 was 81 million 

 

udr is a partner in a joint venture which will develop 274 apartment homes in the central business district of bellevue washington construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is scheduled for completion in 2008 at closing we owned 49 of the project our investment at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 89 million and 59 million respectively 

 

in january 2007 we entered into a joint venture which owns and operates a recently completed 23story 166 apartment home high rise community in the central business district of bellevue washington at closing udr owned 49 of the project subject to a 34 million mortgage our initial investment was 118 million our investment at december 31 2007 was 112 million 

 

in november 2007 udr and an institutional unaffiliated partner formed a joint venture which owns and operates various properties located in texas on the closing date udr sold nine operating properties consisting of 3690 units and contributed one property under development to the joint venture the property under development will have 302 units and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2008 udr contributed cash and property equal to 20 of the fair value of the properties the unaffiliated partner contributed cash equal to 80 of the fair value of the properties comprising the venture which was then used to purchase the nine operating properties from udr our investment at december 31 2007 was 201 million 

 

the following unconsolidated joint venture projects were under development as of december 31 2007 

 

 

disposition of investments 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 udr sold 21 communities with a total of 7125 apartment homes for a gross consideration of 7292 million one parcel of land for 45 million and contributed one property under development at cost to a joint venture arrangement in texas in addition we sold 61 condominiums from two communities with a total of 640 condominiums for a gross consideration of 104 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 2562 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 udr sold 24 communities with 7653 apartment homes for a gross consideration of 4449 million in addition we sold 384 condominiums from four communities with a total of 612 condominiums for a gross consideration of 721 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 1486 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities during 2007 was 1781 million compared to 930 million in 2006 as part of the plan to improve our balance sheet we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity and debt offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and purchase new properties 

 

the following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

  

credit facilities 

 

we have four secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 7489 million as of december 31 2007 6639 million was outstanding under the fannie mae credit facilities leaving 850 million of unused capacity the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and certain variable rate facilities can be extended for an additional five years at our option we have 5831 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 59 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 51 

 

on july 27 2007 we amended and restated our existing threeyear 500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of may 31 2008 which could be extended for an additional year at our option to increase the facility to 600 million and to extend its maturity to july 26 2012 under certain circumstances we may increase the new 600 million credit facility to 750 million based on our current credit ratings the 600 million credit facility carries an interest rate equal to libor plus a spread of 475 basis points which represents a 10 basis point reduction to the previous 500 million credit facility 

under a competitive bid feature and for so long as we maintain an investment grade rating we have the right under the new 600 million credit facility to bid out 50 of the commitment amount and we can bid out 100 of the commitment amount once per quarter as of december 31 2007 3095 million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving 2905 million of unused capacity 

 

the fannie mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of our market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under our fannie mae credit facility and our bank revolving credit facility which totaled 808 million and 3095 million respectively at december 31 2007 the impact on our financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2007 was immaterial 

 

if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2008 than they did during 2007 our interest expense would increase and income before taxes would decrease by 52 million comparatively if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2007 than in 2006 our interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by 49 million if market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2007 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from 29 billion to 28 billion if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31 2007 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 29 billion to 31 billion 

 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

 

funds from operations 

 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property 

premiums or original issuance costs associated with preferred stock redemptions plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

 

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for the three years ended december 31 2007 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership units convertible debt and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count 

 

re 3 is our subsidiary that focuses on development land entitlement and shortterm hold investments re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with re 3 tax benefits and gain on sales net of taxes to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2007 shares in thousands 

 

 

 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on generally accepted accounting principles is as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

net income available to common stockholders 

 

2007vs2006 

 

net income available to common stockholders was 2052 million 153 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 1132 million 085 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared to the same period in 2006 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

 36 

 

these increases in income were partially offset by a 136 million increase in real estate depreciation and amortization expense an 84 million increase in general and administrative expense 43 million in severance costs and other restructuring charges in 2007 23 million in premiums on preferred stock repurchases in 2007 and a 09 million decrease in nonproperty income during 2007 when compared to 2006 

 

2006vs2005 

 

net income available to common stockholders was 1132 million 085 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 1398 million 103 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2005 representing a decrease of 266 million 018 per diluted share the decrease for the year ended december 31 2006 when compared to the same period in 2005 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

  

these decreases in net income were partially offset by 51 million more in gains recognized from the sale of depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture an 85 million decrease in losses on early debt retirement and a 342 million increase in apartment community operating results in 2006 when compared to 2005 

 

apartment community operations 

 

our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total apartment portfolio for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 37 

the following table is our reconciliation of property operating income to net income as reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

2007vs2006 same communities 

 

our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to december 31 2006 and held on december 31 2007 which consisted of 30686 apartment homes provided 57 of our property net operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

same community property net operating income increased 70 or 177 million compared to 2006 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 50 or 188 million increase in revenues from rental and other income and a 09 or 11 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 42 or 162 million increase in rental rates an 114 or 30 million increase in reimbursement income and fee income and a 162 or 10 million decrease in rental concessions these increases were partially offset by a 68 or 13 million increase in vacancy loss physical occupancy decreased 02 to 946 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 52 or 18 million increase in real estate taxes that was partially offset by a 76 or 08 million decrease in administrative and marketing costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income increased 13 to 682 

 

nonmature communities 

 

the remaining 43 or 2062 million of our property net operating income during the year ended december 31 2007 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” udr’s nonmature communities consist primarily of communities acquired or developed in 2006 and 2007 sold properties redevelopment properties properties classified as real estate held for disposition and condominium properties 

 

the largest component our nonmature portfolio are those properties that are classified as real estate held for disposition at december 31 2007 udr had 86 apartment communities two condominium projects and one commercial unit included in real estate held held for disposition for the year ended december 31 2007 these communities provided 1365 million of property net operating income 

2006vs2005 same communities 

 

our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to december 31 2005 and held on december 31 2006 which consisted of 60062 apartment homes provided 82 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 same community property operating income increased 86 or 304 million compared to 2005 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 60 or 342 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 18 or 39 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 49 or 284 million increase in rental rates a 176 or 22 million decrease in rental concessions and a 125 or 50 million increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 947 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 158 or 16 million increase in insurance costs a 44 or 15 million increase in utility costs a 28 or 15 million increase in personnel costs a 11 or 04 million increase in repair and maintenance expenses and a 05 or 03 million increase in real estate taxes these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a 60 or 12 million decrease in administrative and marketing expenses 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin increased 15 to 635 

 

nonmature communities

general

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders as a qualified reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders in 2006 we declared total distributions of 125 per common share to our stockholders which represents our 30th year of consecutive dividend increases to our stockholders 

 

we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our corporate headquarters is located at 400 east cary street richmond virginia our principal executive offices are located at 1745 shea center drive suite 200 highlands ranch colorado as of february 20 2007 we had 1809 fulltime employees and 127 parttime employees

2006 accomplishments 

 

  

business objectives and operating strategies 

 

our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

 2 

 

  

acquisitions 

 

during 2006 using the proceeds from our disposition program as well as debt offerings we acquired eight communities with 2763 apartment homes at a total cost of approximately 3275 million including the assumption of secured debt in addition we purchased two parcels of land for 199 million 

 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

 

  

the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and our yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  

 

 

 

dispositions 

 

we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio during 2006 we sold over 7600 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions 

 

factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

 

 3 

 

at december 31 2006 we had two communities with a total of 475 apartment homes one community with a total of 320 condominiums one commercial unit and one parcel of land classified as real estate held for disposition we are in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings 

 

upgrading and development activities 

 

during 2006 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where we concluded there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2006 we spent 216 million on five development projects that are expected to be completed in 2007 and 2008 revenue enhancing capital expenditures including kitchen and bath renovations and other extensive interior upgrades totaled 1441 million or 2002 per home for the year ended december 31 2006 in addition we spent 370 million on major renovation projects that included major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings and the wiring andor replumbing of an entire building 

 

the following wholly owned projects were under development as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

in addition we owned five parcels of land held for future development aggregating 354 million at december 31 2006 

 

the following consolidated joint venture projects were under development as of december 31 2006 

 

 

financing activities 

 

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2006 

 

  

markets and competitive conditions 

 

at december 31 2006 we owned 242 apartment communities in 33 markets in 16 states when comparing fourth quarter 2006 to the same period in the prior year 90 of the portfolio generated positive revenue growth and 75 of the portfolio generated positive net operating income growth we have a geographically diverse portfolio and we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

 

we believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two decades in particular we believe the annual number of young people entering the workforce and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years the number of single people and single parent households continues to grow significantly the immigrant population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace each of these population segments has a high propensity to rent 

 

in many of our markets competition for new residents is intense some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities can use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

 5 

 

  

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement 

 

communities 

 

at december 31 2006 our apartment portfolio included 242 communities having a total of 70339 completed apartment homes in addition we had five apartment communities under development the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and our upgrade and rehabilitation program the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore should result in increased cash flow 

 

same community comparison 

 

for 2006 same community property operating income increased 86 or 304 million compared to 2005 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 60 or 342 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 18 or 39 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 49 or 284 million increase in rental rates a 176 or 22 million decrease in concession expense and a 125 or 50 million increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 947 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 158 or 16 million increase in insurance costs a 44 or 15 million increase in utility costs a 28 or 15 million increase in personnel costs a 11 or 04 million increase in repair and maintenance expenses and a 05 or 03 million increase in real estate taxes these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a 60 or 12 million decrease in administrative and marketing expenses 

 

customers 

 

our upgrade and rehabilitation programs enable us to raise rents and attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities 

 

we believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years and that the immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part of the renter base accordingly we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger households or to the immigrant populations these communities will often be located close to where these residents work shop and play 

 

tax matters 

 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than net capital gains to our stockholders provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on 

our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may utilize taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

 

inflation 

 

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents to provide an attractive hedge against inflation 

 

environmental matters 

 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices to residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we acquire in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a relatively conservative posture toward accepting known environmental risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

insurance 

 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forwardlooking statements set forth in this report relating to our financial results operations and business prospects except as required 

by law we undertake no obligation to update any such forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made 

 

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following 

 

  

the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism at the same time productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy continued weakness in job creation or any worsening of current economic conditions generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders 

 

new acquisitions developments and condominium projects may not achieve anticipated results we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium projects our acquisition development and condominium activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

  

possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale 

of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable 

 

increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

 

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so 

 

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

  

expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

 

debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

 

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

 

development and construction risks could impact our profitability we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development activities may be conducted through wholly owned 

affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

  

construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

 

some potential losses are not covered by insurance we maintain insurance policies covering our property and operating activities which are of the type and in amounts we believe are reasonable and appropriate to cover our business there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance including certain extraordinary losses resulting from environmental damage or successive natural disasters or other catastrophes accordingly we may sustain uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

 

we may not be able to renew insurance coverage in an adequate amount or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and mold or if offered these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property material losses in excess of insurance proceeds may occur in the future if one or more of our significant properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property such events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 

 14 

 

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 4925 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 15 of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively and it would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

 

risk of inflationdeflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

 

limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely affect our growth 

 

failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability 

 

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

 

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

 

we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any 

time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year and applicable relief provisions under the code were not available we would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service or “irs” granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

 

we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established taxable reit subsidiaries in which we conduct a portion of our business despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

 

changes in market conditions and volatility of stock prices could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the stock markets including the new york stock exchange on which we list our common shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations as a result the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 

 

property ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest we have in the past and expect in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures as a result we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to operate a jointlyowned property moreover joint venture partners may have business economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property in some instances joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

 

real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from compliance with or changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with or changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and the fair housing amendments act of 1988 may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal report over financial reporting if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

 

maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

 

limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this and other reit ownership requirements however the restrictions may have the effect of preventing a change of control which does not threaten reit status these restrictions include a provision that generally limits ownership by any person of more than 99 of the value of our outstanding equity stock unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests 

 

under the terms of our shareholder rights plan our board of directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15 of the outstanding shares of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the person’s purchase after that person acquires more than 15 of our outstanding common stock all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value purchases by other stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person our board of directors however can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us additional information regarding our shareholder rights plan is set forth in note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this report

liquidity and capital resources 

 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes we routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities 

 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities we believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and longterm likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations 

 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities warrants purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

 

future capital needs 

 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of property with construction loans through joint ventures and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties 

 

during 2007 we have approximately 817 million of secured debt and 1673 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity or from disposition proceeds 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates these policies include those related to 1 capital expenditures 2 impairment of longlived assets and 3 real estate investment properties with respect to these critical accounting policies we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

 

capital expenditures 

 

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

 

during 2006 2157 million or 2996 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development condominium conversions and commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as roofs siding parking lots and other nonrevenue enhancing capital expenditures which 

aggregated 346 million or 480 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades upgrades to hvac equipment and other extensive exteriorinterior upgrades totaled 1441 million or 2002 per home and major renovations totaled 370 million or 514 per home for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development condominium conversions and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

 

 

total capital improvements increased 596 million or 934 per home for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 this increase was attributable to an additional 183 million of major renovations at certain of our properties these renovations included the rewiring andor replumbing of an entire building as well as major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings the increase was also attributable to an additional 455 million being invested in revenue enhancing improvements these increases were offset by a 42 million decrease in recurring capital expenditures we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2007 are currently expected to be approximately 610 per home 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

 

real estate investment properties 

 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present 

value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

 

statements of cash flow 

 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing and financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

operating activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2296 million compared to 2482 million for 2005 during 2006 the decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from an 185 million increase in interest expense a decrease of 171 million in other income due to a 2005 sale of a technology investment an 114 million increase in operating assets and a 98 million decrease in operating liabilities in 2006 as compared to 2005 these decreases in cash flow from operating activities were partially offset by a 342 million increase in property operating results from our apartment community portfolio see discussion under “apartment community operations” 51 million more in gains recognized from the sale of depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture in 2006 as compared to 2005 and an 85 million decrease in prepayment penalties from 2005 

 

investing activities 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 net cash used in investing activities was 1500 million compared to 2190 million for 2005 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail below 

 

acquisitions 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 we acquired eight apartment communities with 2763 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 3275 million and two parcels of land for 199 million for 2005 we acquired eight apartment communities with 2561 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 3909 million and one parcel of land for 29 million our longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been expanding our interests in the fast growing southern california florida and metropolitan washington dc markets over the past three years during 2007 we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance expected job growth current and anticipated housing supply and demand and the ability to attract and support household formation 

 

real estate under development 

 

development activity is focused in core markets in which we have strong operations in place for the year ended december 31 2006 we invested approximately 1018 million in development projects an increase of 525 million from our 2005 level of 493 million 

 

the following wholly owned projects were under development as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

in addition we owned five parcels of land held for future development aggregating 354 million at december 31 2006 

 

development joint ventures 

 

in june 2006 we completed the formation of a development joint venture that will invest approximately 138 million to develop one apartment community with 298 apartment homes in marina del rey california udr is the financial partner and is responsible for funding the costs of development and receives a preferred return from 7 to 85 before our partner receives a 50 participation our initial investment was 275 million 

 

in july 2006 we closed on a joint venture to develop a site in bellevue washington at closing we owned 49 of the 135 million project that involves building a 400 home high rise apartment building with ground floor retail our initial investment was 57 million 

 

in november 2006 we closed on a joint venture to develop a site close to bellevue plaza in the central business district of bellevue washington this project will include the development of 271 apartment homes construction began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is scheduled for completion in 2008 at closing we owned 49 of the 97 million project our initial investment was 100 million 

 

under fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” these ventures have been consolidated into udr’s financial statements our joint venture partners are the managing partners as well as the developers general contractors and property managers 

 

the following consolidated joint venture projects were under development as of december 31 2006 

 

 

disposition of investments 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 udr sold 24 communities with 7653 apartment homes for a gross consideration of 4449 million in addition we sold 384 condominiums from four communities with a total of 612 condominiums for a gross consideration of 721 million we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 1486 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

 

for the year ended december 31 2005 udr sold 22 communities with 6352 apartment homes and 240 condominiums from five communities with a total of 648 condominiums for a gross consideration of 4563 million in addition we sold our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture for 392 million and one parcel of land for 09 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 1435 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt and acquire additional communities in conjunction with the sale of ten communities in july 2005 we received shortterm notes for 1247 million that bear interest at 675 and had maturities ranging from september 2005 to july 2006 as of december 31 2006 all of the notes receivable had matured and had been repaid we recognized previously deferred gains for financial reporting purposes of 64 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

during 2007 we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns we intend to use the proceeds from 2007 dispositions to reduce debt acquire communities and fund development activity 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used in financing activities during 2006 was 930 million compared to 215 million in 2005 as part of the plan to improve our balance sheet we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity and debt offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and purchase new properties 

 

the following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

  

credit facilities 

 

we have four secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 860 million as of december 31 2006 6918 million was outstanding under the fannie mae credit facilities leaving 1682 million of unused capacity the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and can be extended for an additional five years at our discretion we have 3994 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 61 and the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 59 

 

we have a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in may 2008 and at our option can be extended an additional year we have the right to increase the credit facility to 750 million under 

certain circumstances based on our current credit ratings the credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 575 basis points under a competitive bid feature and for so long as we maintain an investment grade rating we have the right to bid out 100 of the commitment amount as of december 31 2006 872 million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving 4128 million of unused capacity 

 

the fannie mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of our market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under our fannie mae credit facility and our bank revolving credit facility which totaled 2925 million and 872 million respectively at december 31 2006 the impact on our financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2006 was immaterial 

 

if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2007 than they did during 2006 our interest expense would increase and income before taxes would decrease by 49 million comparatively if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2006 than in 2005 our interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by 60 million if market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2006 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from 27 billion to 26 billion if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31 2006 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 27 billion to 29 billion 

 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

 

funds from operations 

 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus 

depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

 

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for the three years ended december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership shares and the shares of series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count for the year ended december 31 2004 distributions to preferred stockholders exclude 57 million related to premiums on preferred stock conversions 

 

net incremental gains on the sale of condominium homes and the net incremental gain on the disposition of real estate investments developed for sale are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with gainslosses on the sale of condominium homes and gainslosses on the disposition of real estate investments developed for sale to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2006 shares in thousands 

 

 

 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on generally accepted accounting principles is as follows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

net income available to common stockholders 

 

2006vs2005 

 

net income available to common stockholders was 1132 million 085 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 1398 million 103 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2005 representing a decrease of 266 million 018 per diluted share the decrease for the year ended december 31 2006 when compared to the same period in 2005 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

 34 

 

  

these decreases in net income were partially offset by 51 million more in gains recognized from the sale of depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture an 85 million decrease in losses on early debt retirement and a 342 million increase in apartment community operating results in 2006 when compared to 2005

our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total apartment portfolio for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 35 

the following table is our reconciliation of property operating income to net income as reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

2006vs2005 

 

same communities 

 

our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to december 31 2005 and held on december 31 2006 which consisted of 60062 apartment homes provided 82 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 same community property operating income increased 86 or 304 million compared to 2005 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 60 or 342 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 18 or 39 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 49 or 284 million increase in rental rates a 176 or 22 million decrease in concession expense and a 125 or 50 million increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income physical occupancy increased 01 to 947 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 158 or 16 million increase in insurance costs a 44 or 15 million increase in utility costs a 28 or 15 million increase in personnel costs a 11 or 04 million increase in repair and maintenance expenses and a 05 or 03 million increase in real estate taxes these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a 60 or 12 million decrease in administrative and marketing expenses 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income increased 15 to 635 

 

nonmature communities 

 

the remaining 18 of our property operating income during 2006 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed in 2005 and 2006 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 16 communities with 5324 apartment homes that we acquired in 2005 and 2006 provided 328 million of property operating income the 46 communities with 14005 homes and the 624 condominiums from five communities that we sold in 2005 and 2006 provided 183 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 438 apartment homes completed in 2005 and 2006 provided 22 million of operating income and the two communities with 475 apartment homes one community with 320 

condominiums and the one commercial unit classified as real estate held for disposition provided 55 million of property operating income other nonmature communities provided 231 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2006

for the year ended december 31 2005 same community property operating income increased 34 or 103 million compared to 2004 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 38 or 186 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was partially offset by a 44 or 83 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 20 or 103 million increase in rental rates a 202 or 29 million decrease in concession expense a 75 or 26 million increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income a 78 or 25 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 156 or 04 million decrease in bad debt expense physical occupancy increased 06 to 945 

 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 43 or 20 million increase in real estate taxes a 38 or 19 million increase in personnel costs a 38 or 11 million increase in utilities expense a 29 or 09 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 47 or 08 million increase in administrative and marketing costs a 467 or 07 million increase in incentive compensation and a 54 or 05 million increase in insurance costs 

 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin decreased 03 to 615 

 

nonmature communities 

 

the remaining 27 of our property operating income during 2005 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed in 2003 2004 and 2005 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 41 communities with 12458 apartment homes that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003 and in 2004 and 2005 provided 875 million of property operating income the 22 communities with 6352 apartment homes and 240 condominiums sold during 2005 provided 100 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 244 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2003 provided 07 million of property operating income during 2005 the four communities with a total of 384 condominiums classified as real estate held for disposition provided 03 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities which includes homes that are undergoing major rehabilitation provided 175 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 317 million or 148 compared to 2005 primarily due to the significant increase in per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and other capital expenditures 

 

for the year ended december 31 2005 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 318 million or 176 compared to 2004 primarily due to the significant increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and other capital expenditures 

 

interest expense 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 185 million or 113 from 2005 primarily due to the issuance of debt and higher interest rates for the year ended december 31 2006 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 117 or 3504 million compared to 2005 and the weighted average interest rate increased from 53 to 54 during 2006 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2006 is higher than 2005 as acquisition costs in 2005 and in 2006 have been funded in most part by the issuance of debt the increase in the weighted average interest rate during 2006 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had higher interest rates when compared to the prior year that were partially offset by the retirement of higher coupon debt with lower coupon debt 

 

for the year ended december 31 2005 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 472 million or 381 from 2004 primarily due to the issuance of debt and 85 million in prepayment penalties for the year ended december 31 2005 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 307 or 6974 million compared to 2004 and the weighted average interest rate increased from 50 to 53 during 2005 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2005 is higher than 2004 as acquisition costs in 2005 have been funded in most part by the issuance of debt the increase in the weighted average interest rate during 2005 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had higher interest rates when compared to the prior year 

 

general and administrative 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 general and administrative expenses increased 64 million or 257 over 2005 due to a number of factors including increases in incentive compensation professional fees relocation costs and an operating lease on an airplane

gains on the sale of land depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture 

 

for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we recognized aftertax gains for financial reporting purposes of 1486 million and 1435 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

 

premium on preferred stock conversions 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we exercised our right to redeem 2 million shares of our series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock upon receipt of our redemption notice the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3076769 shares of common stock at a price of 1625 per share as a result we recognized a 57 million premium on preferred stock conversions 

 

the premium amount recognized to convert these shares represents the cumulative accretion to date between the conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at which it was recorded at the time of issuance 

 

ebay purchase of rentcom 

 

on december 16 2004 ebay announced that it had agreed to acquire privately held rentcom a leading internet listing web site in the apartment and rental housing industry for approximately 415 million plus acquisition costs net of rentcom’s cash on hand on february 23 2005 ebay announced that it had completed the acquisition we owned shares in rentcom and as a result of the transaction we recorded a onetime pretax gain of 123 million on the sale in august 2006 we received an additional 08 million representing our portion of the escrow balance 

 

inflation 

 

we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation

2005 accomplishments 

 

business objectives and operating strategies 

our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 

 

 

acquisitions 

during 2005 using the proceeds from our disposition program as well as equity and debt offerings we acquired eight communities with 2561 apartment homes at a total cost of approximately 3909 million including the assumption of secured debt in addition we purchased one parcel of land for 29 million 

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

 

the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and our yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  

 

dispositions 

we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio profitability during 2005 we sold over 6300 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and 

performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions 

factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

 

at december 31 2005 there were four communities with a total of 384 condominiums and two parcels of land classified as real estate held for disposition we are in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings 

upgrading and development activities 

during 2005 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2005 we spent 493 million on five development projects that are expected to be completed in 2006 and 2007 revenue enhancing capital expenditures including kitchen and bath renovations and other extensive interior upgrades totaled 986 million or 1302 per home for the year ended december 31 2005 in addition we spent 187 million on major renovation projects that included major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings and the wiring andor replumbing of an entire building 

the following wholly owned projects were under development as of december 31 2005 

 

in addition we owned four parcels of land held for future development aggregating 208 million at december 31 2005 

financing activities 

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions debt and equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a summary of our major financing activities in 2005 

 

 

 

markets and competitive conditions 

at december 31 2005 we owned 259 apartment communities in 43 markets in 16 states when comparing fourth quarter 2005 to the same period in the prior year 84 of the portfolio generated positive revenue growth and 69 of the portfolio generated positive net operating income growth we have a geographically diverse portfolio 

and we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

we believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two decades in particular we believe the annual number of young people entering the workforce and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years the number of single people and single parent households continues to grow significantly the immigrant population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace each of these population segments has a high propensity to rent 

in many of our markets competition for new residents is intense some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities frequently use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

 

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement 

communities 

at december 31 2005 our apartment portfolio included 259 communities having a total of 74875 completed apartment homes in addition we had five apartment communities under development the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and our upgrade and rehabilitation program the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore increases cash flow 

same communities 

for 2005 same community property operating income increased 34 or 103 million compared to 2004 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 38 or 186 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was partially offset by a 44 or 83 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 20 or 103 million increase in rental rates a 202 or 29 million decrease in concession expense a 75 or 26 million increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income a 78 or 25 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 156 or 04 million decrease in bad debt expense physical occupancy increased 06 to 945 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 43 or 20 million increase in real estate taxes a 38 or 19 million increase in personnel costs a 38 or 11 million increase in utilities expense a 29 or 09 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 47 or 08 million increase in administrative and marketing costs a 467 or 07 million increase in incentive compensation and a 54 or 05 million increase in insurance costs 

customers 

our upgrade and rehabilitation programs enable us to raise rents and attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities 

we believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years and that the immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part of the renter base accordingly we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger households or to the immigrant populations these communities will often be located close to where these residents work shop and play 

tax matters 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets our income be derived primarily from real estate assets and that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent such net income is distributed to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

we may utilize several taxable reit subsidiaries to engage in activities that reits may be prohibited from performing including the provision of management and other services to third parties and the conduct of certain nonqualifying real estate transactions taxable reit subsidiaries generally are taxable as regular corporations and therefore are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

inflation 

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive hedge against inflation 

environmental matters 

various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the ongoing operation of our communities such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestoscontaining materials in buildings management of surfaces with leadbased paint and notices of residents about the leadbased paint use of active underground petroleum storage tanks and wastemanagement activities the failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to a government enforcement action andor claims for damages by a private party 

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we own in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental 

assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

insurance 

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period

 item 1a risk factors 

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

  unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following 

 

the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism at the same time productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy continued weakness in job creation or any worsening of current economic conditions generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders 

  new acquisitions developments and condominium projects may not achieve anticipated results we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria and to develop apartment communities for rental operations to convert properties into condominiums and to develop condominium projects our acquisition development and condominium activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

 

 

  possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable 

  increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

  insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints sufficient cash flow may not be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes and the full limits of our line of credit may not be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so 

  failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

 

expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that 

community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

  debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

  financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

  development and construction risks could impact our profitability we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 

construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

  failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

 

 

  changing interest rates could increase interest costs and adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 578 million of variable rate indebtedness outstanding which constitutes approximately 18 of our total outstanding indebtedness as of such date an increase in interest rates would increase our interest expenses to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively and it would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness and of issuing new debt accordingly higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

  limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth  we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely affect our growth 

  failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability 

  interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

  potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

  we would incur adverse tax consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to continue to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income also unless the internal revenue service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we first failed to qualify the additional tax liability from the failure to qualify as a reit would reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for investment or distribution to our stockholders this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities and our ability to raise additional capital in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

  we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which are subject to certain tax risks we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature or are otherwise not respected 

  certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

  maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23 of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represents 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

  limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half of any taxable year our charter contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this requirement these restrictions include a provision that generally limits a person from beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of our outstanding equity stock in excess of a 99 ownership interest unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our 

outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests 

under the terms of our shareholder rights plan our board of directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15 of the outstanding shares of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the person’s purchase after that person acquires more than 15 of our outstanding common stock all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value purchases by other stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person our board of directors however can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes we routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities 

we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities we believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and longterm likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations 

we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which provides for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities warrants purchase contracts and units to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets this shelf registration statement replaces our previous 15 billion shelf registration statement in 2005 we completed various financing activities under our previous 15 billion shelf registration statement these activities are summarized in the section titled “financing activities” that follows access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

future capital needs 

future development expenditures are expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of property with construction loans through joint ventures and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties 

during 2006 we have approximately 366 million of secured debt and 1352 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity or from disposition proceeds 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates these policies include those related to 1 capital expenditures 2 impairment of longlived assets and 3 real estate investment properties with respect to these critical accounting policies we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

capital expenditures 

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially 

extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

during 2005 1561 million or 2062 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development and commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as hvac equipment roofs siding parking lots and other nonrevenue enhancing capital expenditures which aggregated 388 million or 513 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades and other extensive interior upgrades totaled 986 million or 1302 per home and major renovations totaled 187 million or 247 per home for the year ended december 31 2005 

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development and commercial properties for the periods presented 

 

total capital improvements increased 739 million or 990 per home for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 this increase was attributable to 187 million of major renovations at certain of our properties these renovations included the rewiring andor replumbing of an entire building as well as major structural changes andor architectural revisions to existing buildings the increase was also attributable to an additional 527 million being invested in revenue enhancing improvements we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2006 are currently expected to be approximately 530 per home 

  impairment of longlived assets 

we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

  real estate investment properties 

we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all 

cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial leaseup period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

statements of cash flow 

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing and financing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

  operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2005 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2482 million compared to 2517 million for 2004 during 2005 the slight decrease in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from a 472 million increase in interest expense that was primarily offset by a 91 million net increase in operating assetsliabilities for the period and a 326 million increase in property operating results from our apartment community portfolio see discussion under “apartment community operations” 

  investing activities 

for the year ended december 31 2005 net cash used in investing activities was 2190 million compared to 5960 million for 2004 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail below 

  acquisitions 

for the year ended december 31 2005 we acquired eight apartment communities with 2561 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 3909 million and one parcel of land for 29 million for 2004 we acquired 28 apartment communities with 8060 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 3909 million and one parcel of land for 163 million our longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been expanding our interests in the fast growing southern california florida and metropolitan washington dc markets over the past two years during 2006 we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance expected job growth current and anticipated housing supply and demand and the ability to attract and support household formation 

  real estate under development 

development activity is focused in core markets in which we have strong operations in place for the year ended december 31 2005 we invested approximately 493 million in development projects an increase of 302 million from our 2004 level of 191 million 

the following projects were under development as of december 31 2005 

 

in addition we own four parcels of land that we continue to hold for future development that had a carrying value as of december 31 2005 of 208 million 

  disposition of investments 

for the year ended december 31 2005 united dominion sold 22 communities with 6352 apartment homes and 240 condominiums from five communities with a total of 648 condominiums for a gross consideration of 4563 million in addition we sold our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture for 392 million and one parcel of land for 09 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 1435 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt and acquire additional communities in connection with our third quarter portfolio sale of ten communities in texas and north carolina we received shortterm notes of 1247 million these notes had maturities ranging from september 2005 to july 2006 as of december 31 2005 the outstanding balance on these notes was 598 million bearing interest at 675 

for the year ended december 31 2004 we sold 19 communities with 5425 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 2701 million in addition we sold 24 of 36 townhomes of a community for 73 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 529 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

during 2006 we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale we intend to use the proceeds from 2006 dispositions to reduce debt acquire communities and fund development activity 

  financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2005 was 215 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 3473 million in 2004 as part of the plan to improve our balance sheet we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity and debt offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and purchase new properties 

the following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

 

 

  credit facilities 

we have four secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 860 million as of december 31 2005 6563 million was outstanding under the fannie mae credit facilities leaving 2037 million of unused capacity the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and can be extended for an additional five years at our discretion we have 3639 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 61 the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 47 

we have a 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in may 2008 and at our option can be extended an additional year we have the right to increase the credit facility to 750 million under certain circumstances based on our current credit ratings the credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 575 basis points as of december 31 2005 2108 million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving 2892 million of unused capacity 

the fannie mae credit facility and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

  interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced united dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of our market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under our fannie mae credit facility and our bank revolving credit facility which totaled 2925 million and 2108 million respectively at december 31 2005 the impact on our financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2005 was immaterial 

if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2006 than they did during 2005 our interest expense would increase and income before taxes would decrease by 60 million comparatively if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2005 than in 2004 our interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by 74 million if market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2005 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from 26 billion to 24 billion if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31 2005 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 26 billion to 27 billion 

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

funds from operations 

funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among 

the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for the three years ended december 31 2005  dollars in thousands  

 

in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership shares and the shares of series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 distributions to preferred stockholders exclude 57 million and 193 million respectively related to premiums on preferred stock conversions 

net incremental gains on the sale of condominium homes and the net incremental gain on the sale of a depreciable asset related to an unconsolidated entity are defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with gainslosses on the sale of condominium homes and gainslosses on the sale of depreciable assets related to an unconsolidated entity to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because the shortterm use of funds produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2005  shares in thousands  

 

ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on generally accepted accounting principles is as follows  dollars in thousands

net income available to common stockholders was 1398 million 102 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 719 million 056 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004 representing an increase of 679 million 046 per diluted share the increase for the year ended december 31 2005 when compared to the same period in 2004 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

  •  906 million more in gains recognized from the sale of depreciable property and an unconsolidated joint venture in 2005 

  • a 326 million increase in apartment community operating results in 2005

  2005vs2004 

  same communities 

our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to september 30 2004 and held on december 31 2005 which consisted of 58840 apartment homes provided 73 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 

for the year ended december 31 2005 same community property operating income increased 34 or 103 million compared to 2004 the increase in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 38 or 186 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was partially offset by a 44 or 83 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 20 or 103 million increase in rental rates a 202 or 29 million decrease in concession expense a 75 or 26 million increase in utility reimbursement income and fee income a 78 or 25 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 156 or 04 million decrease in bad debt expense physical occupancy increased 06 to 945 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 43 or 20 million increase in real estate taxes a 38 or 19 million increase in personnel costs a 38 or 11 million increase in utilities expense a 29 or 09 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 47 or 08 million increase in administrative and marketing costs a 467 or 07 million increase in incentive compensation and a 54 or 05 million increase in insurance costs 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income decreased 03 to 615 

  nonmature communities 

the remaining 27 of our property operating income during 2005 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed in 2003 2004 and 2005 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 41 communities with 12458 apartment homes that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003 and in 2004 and 2005 provided 875 million of property operating income the 22 communities with 6352 apartment homes and 240 condominiums sold during 2005 provided 100 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 244 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2003 provided 07 million of property operating income during 2005 the four communities with a total of 384 condominiums classified as real estate held for disposition provided 03 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities which includes homes that are undergoing major rehabilitation provided 175 

million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 

  2004vs2003 

  same communities 

our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to december 31 2003 and held on december 31 2004 which consisted of 62497 apartment homes provided 78 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2004 

for 2004 same community property operating income decreased 12 or 39 million compared to 2003 the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 05 or 23 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 32 or 62 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 77 or 28 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 143 or 21 million increase in utility reimbursement income these increases in income were offset by a 07 or 36 million decrease in rental rates physical occupancy increased 08 to 938 

the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 54 or 28 million increase in personnel costs a 47 or 15 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 35 or 11 million increase in utilities expense and a 16 or 08 million increase in property taxes 

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin decreased 10 to 610 

  nonmature communities 

the remaining 22 of our property operating income during 2004 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed during 2003 and 2004 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 39 communities with 11574 apartment homes that we acquired during 2003 and 2004 provided 458 million of property operating income the 19 communities with 5425 apartment homes sold during 2004 provided 144 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 178 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2003 provided 10 million of property operating income during 2004 the 12 communities with 2635 apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided 113 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities provided 135 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2004 

real estate depreciation and amortization 

for the year ended december 31 2005 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 318 million or 176 compared to 2004 primarily due to the significant increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and other capital expenditures 

for the year ended december 31 2004 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 172 million or 105 compared to 2003 primarily due to the overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment homes the significant increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and other capital expenditures 

interest expense 

for the year ended december 31 2005 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 472 million or 381 from 2004 primarily due to the issuance of debt and 85 million in prepayment penalties for the year ended december 31 2005 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 307 or 6974 million compared to 2004 and the weighted average interest rate increased from 50 to 53 during 2005 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2005 is higher than 2004 as acquisition costs in 2005 have been funded in most part by the issuance of debt the increase in the weighted average interest rate during 2005 reflects shortterm bank borrowings and variable rate debt that had higher interest rates when compared 

to the prior year 

for the year ended december 31 2004 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 68 million or 58 from 2003 primarily due to the issuance of debt for the year ended december 31 2004 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 212 or 4359 million compared to the prior year however this was partially offset by the weighted average interest rate declining from 54 to 50 during 2004 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2004 is higher than 2003 as acquisition costs in 2004 have been funded in most part by the issuance of debt the decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2004 reflects our ability to take advantage of lower interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt 

general and administrative 

for the year ended december 31 2005 general and administrative expenses increased 55 million or 285 over 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in personnel and incentive compensation costs an operating lease on an airplane compliance costs and an operations improvement initiative 

for the year ended december 31 2004 general and administrative expenses decreased 13 million or 64 over 2003 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investor relations legal and consulting expenses

for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 1435 million and 529 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

premium on preferred stock conversions

2004 accomplishments 

 2 business objectives and operating strategies 

  our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

 acquisitions 

  during 2004 using the proceeds from our disposition program equity and debt offerings we acquired 28 communities with 8060 apartment homes at a total cost of approximately 10 billion including the assumption of secured debt in addition we purchased one parcel of land for 163 million 

  when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

   the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and our yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands  

 dispositions 

  we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio profitability during 2004 we sold over 5400 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets in an effort to 

3 increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions 

  factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

   at december 31 2004 there were 12 apartment communities and one parcel of land classified as real estate held for disposition we are in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings 

upgrading and development activities 

  during 2004 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2004 we spent 176 million on three development projects that are expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures including kitchen and bath renovations and other extensive interior upgrades totaled 459 million or 599 per home for the year ended december 31 2004 

  the following whollyowned projects were under development as of december 31 2004 

   in addition we owned eight parcels of land held for future development aggregating 255 million at december 31 2004 four of the eight parcels represent additional phases to existing communities 

financing activities 

  as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a list of our major financing activities in 2004 

 4 

 markets and competitive conditions 

  at december 31 2004 we owned 273 apartment communities in 43 markets in 17 states of those markets 25 markets or 61 generated positive same community net operating income growth for the 

5 fourth quarter of 2004 when compared to the same period in the prior year we have a geographically diverse portfolio and we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

  we believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two decades in particular we believe the annual number of young people entering the workforce and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years the number of single people and single parent households continues to grow significantly the immigrant population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace each of these population segments has a high propensity to rent 

  despite a strengthening united states economy significant productivity growth has adversely affected employment growth which is the primary driver of demand in our business in addition a sustained low mortgage interest rate environment combined with government and builder incentives to first time home buyers has further siphoned off what would traditionally be demand for apartment homes to maintain occupancy levels during these economic conditions we have reduced rents increased our marketing expenses and provided concessions to our residents 

  in most of our markets competition for new residents is intense some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities frequently use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 

  we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

   moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management improved expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operation coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting the middlemarket of renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement 

communities 

  at december 31 2004 our apartment portfolio included 273 communities having a total of 78855 completed apartment homes in addition we had three apartment communities under development the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and our upgrade program the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water 

6 and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore increases cash flow 

same communities 

  for 2004 same community property operating income decreased 12 or 39 million compared to 2003 the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 05 or 23 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 32 or 62 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 77 or 28 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 143 or 21 million increase in utility reimbursement income these increases in income were offset by a 07 or 36 million decrease in rental rates physical occupancy increased 08 to 938 

  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 54 or 28 million increase in personnel costs a 47 or 15 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 35 or 11 million increase in utilities expense and a 16 or 08 million increase in property taxes 

customers 

  we focus on the broad middlemarket segment of the apartment market that generally consists of rentersbynecessity this group includes young professionals bluecollar families single parent households older singles immigrants nonrelated parties and families renting while waiting to purchase a home we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities 

  we believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years and that the immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part of the renter base accordingly we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger households or to the immigrant populations these communities will often be located close to where these residents work shop and play 

tax matters 

  we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate our income be derived primarily from real estate and that we distribute at least 90 of our taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we will generally not be subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders 

inflation 

  substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive hedge against inflation 

environmental matters 

  to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however in the past the issue has been raised regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous materials in existing real estate properties we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we own in 

7 addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

  federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

  we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

insurance 

  we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

factors affecting our business and prospects 

  there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

  unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following 

 8 

   the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism at the same time productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in limited job growth despite an improving economy continued weakness in job creation or any worsening of current economic conditions generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders 

  acquisitions or new development may not achieve anticipated results we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

   possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable 

  increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

  insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints we cannot assure you that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit nor can we assure you that the full limits of our line of credit will be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so 

9   failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

   expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

  debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

  financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted 

  development and construction risks could impact our profitability we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks 

 10 

   construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

  failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

   changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future interestbearing debt at rates that vary with market interest rates therefore if interest rates increase our interest costs will rise to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

  limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely affect our growth 

  failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability 

  interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the terms of new debt securities are not within the parameters of or market interest rates fall below that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

  potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility 

11 for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

  we are subject to certain tax risks we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code our qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to qualify as a reit but we may not so qualify or we may not be able to remain so qualified in the future in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders 

  if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders in addition we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

  we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which could have adverse tax consequences we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay federal income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature 

  certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction and we may jeopardize our ability to retain future gains on real property sales in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

12   maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 2  3  of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represent 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote 

  limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half of any taxable year our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this requirement these restrictions include a provision that generally limits a person from beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of our outstanding equity stock in excess of a 99 ownership interest unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests 

  under the terms of our shareholder rights plan our board of directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15 of the outstanding shares of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the person’s purchase after that person acquires more than 15 of our outstanding common stock all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value purchases by other stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person our board of directors however can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us

   liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes we routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities 

  we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities we believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and longterm likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations 

  we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 15 billion in common shares preferred shares and debt securities to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets this shelf registration statement replaces our previous 10 billion shelf registration statement and includes 3313 million of unissued securities carried forward from the previous 10 billion shelf registration statement throughout 2004 we completed various financing activities under our 15 billion shelf registration statement these activities are summarized in the section titled “financing activities” that follows as of december 31 2004 approximately 11 billion of equity and debt securities remained available for use under the shelf registration statement access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

  in july 2004 moody’s investors service upgraded our rating on our senior unsecured debt to baa2 from baa3 and our preferred stock to baa3 from ba1 with a stable outlook 

  in october 2004 we filed a prospectus supplement under the securities act of 1933 relating to the offering of up to 5 million shares of our common stock that we may issue and sell through an agent from time to time in “at the market offerings” as defined in rule 415 of the securities act of 1933 any sales of these shares will be made under our 15 billion shelf registration statement pursuant to a sales agreement that we entered into with the agent in july 2003 the sales price of the common stock that may be sold under the sales agreement will be no lower than the minimum price designated by us prior to the sale as of december 31 2004 we have sold a total of 472000 shares of common stock pursuant to the sales agreement at a weighted average sales price of 2036 for net proceeds to us of approximately 94 million 

   future development expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through joint ventures with proceeds from the sale of property with construction loans and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of properties 

25   during 2005 we have approximately 279 million of secured debt and 711 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities or the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity 

   our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates these policies include those related to 1 capital expenditures 2 impairment of longlived assets and 3 real estate investment properties with respect to these critical accounting policies we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

  during 2004 824 million or 1075 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as hvac equipment roofs siding parking lots and other nonrevenue enhancing capital expenditures which aggregated 363 million or 473 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures kitchen and bath upgrades and other extensive interior upgrades totaled 459 million or 599 per home and major renovations totaled 02 million or 3 per home for the year ended december 31 2004 

  the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development for the periods presented 

   total capital improvements increased 292 million or 361 per home in 2004 compared to 2003 we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2005 are currently expected to be approximately 510 per home 

   we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market 

26 and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

   we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases in accordance with fasb statement no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease up period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition in addition we consider the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregone rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the remaining contractual lease period 

   the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating and financing activities and net cash used in investing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 our net cash flow provided by operating activities was 2517 million compared to 2349 million for 2003 during 2004 the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in property operating income due to the overall increase in our apartment community portfolio see discussion under “apartment community operations” 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash used in investing activities was 5960 million compared to 3042 million for 2003 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail below 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 we acquired 28 apartment communities with 8060 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 10 billion and one parcel of land for 163 million in 2003 we acquired 3514 apartment homes in 11 communities for an aggregate consideration of 3477 million and one parcel of land for 31 million in addition we purchased the remaining 47 joint venture partners’ ownership interest in nine communities with 1706 apartment homes in salinas and pacific grove california for 760 million in june 2003 

  our longterm strategic plan is to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets as a result we have been expanding our interests in the fast growing southern california florida and metropolitan dc markets over the past two years during 2005 we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance expected job growth current and anticipated housing supply and demand and the ability to attract and support household formation 

   development activity is focused in core markets in which we have strong operations in place for the year ended december 31 2004 we invested approximately 191 million in development projects an increase of 55 million from our 2003 level of 136 million 

  the following projects were under development as of december 31 2004 

   in addition we own eight parcels of land that we continue to hold for future development that had a carrying value as of december 31 2004 of 255 million four of the eight parcels represent additional phases to existing communities as we plan to add apartment homes adjacent to currently owned communities that are in improving markets 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 we sold 19 communities with 5425 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 2701 million in addition we sold 24 of 36 townhomes of a community for 73 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 529 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

  for the year ended december 31 2003 we sold seven communities with 1927 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 889 million one parcel of land for 13 million and two commercial properties for an aggregate consideration of 73 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 159 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt 

  during 2005 we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale we intend to use the proceeds from 2005 dispositions to reduce debt acquire communities and fund development activity 

   net cash provided by financing activities during 2004 was 3473 million compared to 709 million in 2003 as part of the plan to improve our balance sheet we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity and debt offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and purchase new properties 

  the following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 

 28  29 

   we have four secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 860 million and one with freddie mac for 72 million as of december 31 2004 6563 million was outstanding under the fannie mae credit facilities leaving 2037 million of unused capacity the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and can be extended for an additional five years at our discretion as of december 31 2004 207 million had been funded under the freddie mac credit facility leaving 513 million of unused capacity the freddie mac credit facility is for an initial term of five years with an option for us to extend for an additional fouryear term at the then market rate as of december 31 2004 aggregate borrowings under both the fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities were 677 million we have 2889 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 64 the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 27 

  we have a 500 million threeyear unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in march 2006 if we receive commitments from additional lenders or if the initial lenders increase their commitments we will be able to increase the credit facility to 650 million at our option the credit facility can be extended one year to march 2007 based on our current credit ratings the credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 90 basis points as of december 31 2004 2781 million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving 2219 million of unused capacity 

  the fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

   as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy we have used derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of variable rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions our derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management included various interest rate swaps with indices that related to the pricing of specific financial instruments of the company we believe that we appropriately controlled our interest rate risk through the use of derivative instruments during 2004 the fair value of our derivative instruments improved from an unfavorable 16 million at december 31 2003 to 0 at december 31 2004 this decrease was due to the normal progression of the fair market value of our derivative instruments towards zero as they matured as of december 31 2004 all of united dominion’s interest rate swap agreements had matured 

   we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced united dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of our market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under our fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities and our bank revolving credit facility which totaled 3881 million and 2781 million respectively at december 31 2004 the impact on our financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2004 was immaterial 

  if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2005 than they did during 2004 our interest expense would increase and income before taxes would decrease by 74 million comparatively if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2004 than in 2003 our interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by 58 million if market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2004 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have remained constant at 21 billion if market interest rates for fixed 

30 rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31 2004 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 21 billion to 23 billion 

  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

   funds from operations or ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper we consider ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of our activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 

  historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance and defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo is the best measure of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

31   the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for the three years ended december 31 2004  dollars in thousands  

   in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership shares and the shares of series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 distributions to preferred stockholders exclude 57 million and 193 million respectively related to premiums on preferred stock conversions 

  gains on the disposition of real estate investments developed for sale is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision such development by reits must be conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with gains or losses on real estate developed for sale to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because of the shortterm use of funds to produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 

  the following is a reconciliation of gaap gains on the disposition of real estate developed for sale to gross gains on the disposition of real estate developed for sale for the three years ended december 31 2004  dollars in thousands  

 32   the following table is our reconciliation of ffo share information to weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended december 31 2004  shares in thousands  

   ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on generally accepted accounting principles is as follows  dollars in thousands  

 

   the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

   net income available to common stockholders was 719 million 056 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 248 million 022 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2003 representing an increase of 471 million 034 per diluted share the increase for the year ended december 31 2004 when compared to the same period in 2003 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 33 

   these increases in income were partially offset by a 172 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense a 66 million increase in interest expense and a charge of 55 million for hurricane related expenses in 2004 when compared to 2003 

   net income available to common stockholders was 248 million 021 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 258 million 024 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2002 representing a decrease of 10 million 003 per diluted share the decrease for the year ended december 31 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

   these decreases in income were offset by 370 million less in prepayment penalties and premiums paid in 2003 for the refinancing of mortgage debt and the repurchase of unsecured debt a 158 million decrease in interest expense in 2003 and a 23 million impairment charge taken in 2002 related to a portfolio of properties in memphis tennessee 

   our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total apartment portfolio for each of the periods presented  dollars in thousands  

  

 

 34   the following table is our reconciliation of property operating income to net income as reflected on the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented  dollars in thousands  

 

 

   our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to december 31 2003 and held on december 31 2004 which consisted of 62497 apartment homes provided 78 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2004 

  for 2004 same community property operating income decreased 12 or 39 million compared to 2003 the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 05 or 23 million increase in revenues from rental and other income that was offset by a 32 or 62 million increase in operating expenses the increase in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 77 or 28 million decrease in vacancy loss and a 143 or 21 million increase in utility reimbursement income these increases in income were offset by a 07 or 36 million decrease in rental rates physical occupancy increased 08 to 938 

  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 54 or 28 million increase in personnel costs a 47 or 15 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 35 or 11 million increase in utilities expense and a 16 or 08 million increase in property taxes 

  as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income decreased 10 to 610 

   the remaining 22 of our property operating income during 2004 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed during 2003 and 2004 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 39 communities with 11574 apartment homes that we acquired during 2003 and 2004 provided 458 million of property operating income the 19 communities with 5425 apartment homes sold during 2004 provided 144 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 178 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2003 provided 10 million of property operating income during 2004 the 12 communities with 2635 apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided 113 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities provided 135 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2004 

 

   our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2002 and held on december 31 2003 which consisted of 67814 apartment homes provided 89 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2003 

  for 2003 same community property operating income decreased 42 or 149 million compared to 2002 the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 18 or 99 million decrease in revenues from rental and other income and a 25 or 50 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 22 or 128 million decrease in rental rates this decrease in income was partially offset by an 117 or 17 million increase in submeter gas trash and utility reimbursements a 55 or 10 million decrease in concession expense and a 17 or 07 million decrease in vacancy loss physical occupancy remained constant at 932 for both 2003 and 2002 

  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 176 or 17 million increase in insurance costs a 43 or 14 million increase in utilities expense a 24 or 09 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 39 or 08 million increase in administrative and marketing costs a 07 or 04 million increase in personnel costs and a 08 or 04 million increase in taxes all of which were partially offset by a 176 or 02 million decrease in incentive compensation 

  as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin decreased 16 to 617 

   the remaining 11 of our property operating income during 2003 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed during 2002 and 2003 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 21 communities with 6935 apartment homes that we acquired during 2002 and 2003 provided 306 million of property operating income the seven communities with 1927 apartment homes sold during 2003 provided 46 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 972 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2002 provided 48 million of property operating income during 2003 the one community with 100 apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided 07 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities provided 17 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2003 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 172 million or 105 compared to 2003 primarily due to the overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment homes and a significant increase in the per home acquisition cost compared to the existing portfolio and other capital expenditures 

  for the year ended december 31 2003 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 42 million or 27 compared to 2002 regardless of the decrease in the weighted average number of apartment homes experienced from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to the newly acquired properties having a significantly higher per home cost compared to those properties that were disposed of and other capital expenditures 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 66 million or 56 from 2003 primarily due to the issuance of debt for the year ended december 31 2004 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 212 or 

36 4359 million compared to the prior year however this was partially offset by the weighted average interest rate declining from 54 to 50 during 2004 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2004 is higher than 2003 as acquisition costs in 2004 have been funded in most part by the issuance of debt the decrease in the weighted average interest rate during 2004 reflects our ability to take advantage of lower interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt 

  for the year ended december 31 2003 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 158 million or 119 from 2002 primarily due to debt refinancings decreasing interest rates and an overall decrease in the weighted average level of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2003 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding decreased 11 or 239 million compared to the prior year and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 61 to 54 during 2003 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2003 is lower than 2002 primarily due to the high acquisition volume at the beginning of 2002 that was subsequently mitigated by high disposition activity in the second half of 2002 furthermore acquisition costs in 2003 that exceeded disposition proceeds were funded in most part by equity and op unit issuances the decrease in the average interest rate during 2003 reflects our ability to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt 

   for the year ended december 31 2004 general and administrative expenses decreased 13 million or 64 over 2003 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investor relations legal and consulting expenses 

  for the year ended december 31 2003 general and administrative expenses increased 13 million or 66 over 2002 primarily due to an increase in restricted stock compensation over the past two years united dominion has shifted its longterm incentive reward system from stock options to restricted stock the cost of which is expensed monthly during the vesting period 

   in 2004 we recognized a 55 million charge to cover expenses associated with the damage in florida caused by hurricanes charley frances and jeanne united dominion reported that 25 of its 34 florida communities were affected by the hurricanes 

   in 2003 we recognized a 14 million charge for the writeoff of our investment in realeum inc an unconsolidated development joint venture created to develop webbased solutions for multifamily property and portfolio management 

   for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 529 million and 159 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

   in the fourth quarter of 2004 we exercised our right to redeem 2 million shares of our series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock upon receipt of our redemption notice the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3076769 shares of common stock at a price of 1625 per share as a result we recognized a 57 million premium on preferred stock conversions 

  in the second quarter of 2003 we exercised our right to redeem 2 million shares of our series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock upon receipt of our redemption notice the shares to 

37 be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3076923 shares of common stock at a price of 1625 per share in december 2003 we exercised our right to redeem an additional 4 million shares of our series d upon receipt of our redemption notice the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 6154000 shares of common stock at a price of 1625 per share as a result we recognized a 193 million premium on preferred stock conversions during 2003 

  the premium amount recognized to convert these shares represents the cumulative accretion to date between the conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at which it was recorded at the time of issuance 

   on december 16 2004 ebay nasdaq ebay announced that it had agreed to acquire privately held rentcom a leading internet listing web site in the apartment and rental housing industry for approximately 415 million plus acquisition costs net of rentcom’s cash on hand on february 23 2005 ebay announced that it had completed the acquisition we own shares in rentcom and as a result of the transaction we recorded a onetime pretax gain of 123 million on the sale 

   we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

   the following table summarizes united dominion’s contractual obligations as of december 31 2004  dollars in thousands

our stockholders in 2003 we declared total distributions of 114 per share to our stockholders which represents our 27th year of consecutive dividend increases to our stockholders   we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation in june 2003 we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland our corporate headquarters is located at 400 east cary street richmond virginia our principal executive offices are located at 1745 shea center drive suite 200 highlands ranch colorado as of february 18 2004 we had 1832 fulltime employees and 180 parttime employees   our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships heritage communities lp a delaware limited partnership and united dominion realty lp a limited partnership that changed its state of organization from virginia to delaware in february 2004 unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “united dominion” refer collectively to united dominion realty trust inc and its subsidiaries 2003 accomplishments  2 business objectives and operating strategies   our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our stockholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies  acquisitions   during 2003 using the proceeds from our disposition program and our equity offerings we acquired 21 communities with 5220 apartment homes at a total cost of approximately 4237 million including the assumption of debt and the use of taxfree exchange funds in addition we purchased one parcel of land for 31 million   when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider    the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions and yearend ownership position for the past five years  dollars in thousands   3 dispositions   we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio profitability during 2003 we sold over 1900 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used primarily to reduce debt and fund acquisitions   factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include    at december 31 2003 there was one apartment community and one parcel of land classified as real estate held for disposition we are in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings upgrading and development activities   during 2003 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2003 we spent 122 million to develop 178 apartment homes as an additional phase to an existing community in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures including water submetering the initial installation of microwaves or washerdryers and extensive interior upgrades totaled 154 million or 207 per home for the year ended december 31 2003   the following whollyowned projects were under development as of december 31 2003    in addition we owned six parcels of land held for future development aggregating 78 million at december 31 2003 five of the six parcels represent additional phases to existing properties   in september 2002 we entered into a development joint venture with aegon usa realty advisors inc in which we are serving as the managing member the joint venture is expected to develop approximately eight to ten gardenstyle apartment communities over the next three years with a total development cost of up to 210 million the joint venture will obtain bank construction financing for 65 to 80 of total costs and will provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with aegon providing 80 and us providing 20 we are serving as the developer general contractor and property manager for the joint venture and have guaranteed those project development costs excluding financing costs including fees and interest which exceed the defined project cost budgeted amounts for each respective project as they come to fruition we believe that the likelihood of funding guarantor obligations is remote and that the impact to us would be immaterial in june 2003 we contributed land with a carrying value of 38 million to the joint venture 4   the following joint venture project was under development as of december 31 2003    we will continue to seek out development and redevelopment opportunities in our core markets and may seek to raise equity with other potential joint venture partners to start new development programs over the next five years financing activities   as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a list of our major financing activities in 2003  5  markets and competitive conditions   at december 31 2003 we owned 264 apartment communities in 55 markets in 19 states of those markets 22 markets or 40 generated positive same community net operating income growth we have a geographically diverse portfolio and we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings   we believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two decades in particular we believe the annual number of young people entering the workforce and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years the number of single people and single parent households continues to grow significantly the immigrant population is also expected to grow at an accelerated pace each of these population segments has a high propensity to rent   despite a strengthening united states economy significant productivity growth has adversely affected employment growth which is the primary driver of demand in our business in addition a sustained low mortgage interest rate environment combined with government and builder incentives to first time home buyers has further siphoned off what would traditionally be demand for apartment homes to maintain occupancy levels during these economic conditions we have increased our marketing expenses and provided certain concessions to our residents   in most of our markets competition for new residents is intense some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have competing communities frequently use concessions or lower rents to obtain temporary competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources or lower capital costs than we do 6   we believe that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include    moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operations coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting the middlemarket of renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement communities   at december 31 2003 our apartment portfolio included 264 communities having a total of 76244 completed apartment homes in addition we had three apartment communities under development the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved since 2001 with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and the upgrading of most of our communities the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore increases future cash flow same communities   for 2003 same community property operating income decreased 42 or 149 million compared to 2002 the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 18 or 99 million decrease in revenues from rental and other income and a 25 or 50 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 22 or 128 million decrease in rental rates this decrease in income was partially offset by an 117 or 17 million increase in submeter gas trash and utility reimbursements a 55 or 10 million decrease in concession expense and a 17 or 07 million decrease in vacancy loss physical occupancy remained constant at 932 for both 2003 and 2002   the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 176 or 17 million increase in insurance costs a 43 or 14 million increase in utilities expense a 24 or 09 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 39 or 08 million increase in administrative and marketing costs a 07 or 04 million increase in personnel costs and a 08 or 04 million increase in taxes all of which were partially offset by a 176 or 02 million decrease in incentive compensation customers   we focus on the broad middlemarket segment of the apartment market that generally consists of rentersbynecessity this group includes young professionals bluecollar families single parent households older singles immigrants nonrelated parties and families renting while waiting to purchase a home we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities   we believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years and that the immigrant population will remain a significant and growing part of the renter base 7 accordingly we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger households or to the immigrant populations these communities will often be located close to where these residents work shop and play 

tax matters   we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests that among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate our income be derived primarily from real estate and that we distribute at least 90 of our taxable income other than our net capital gain to our stockholders provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we will generally not be subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our stockholders inflation   substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive hedge against inflation environmental matters   to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however in the past the issue has been raised regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous materials in existing real estate properties and within the past year there has been an increase in the number of claims of potential healthrelated issues allegedly caused by the presence of mold in confined spaces we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we own in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties we believe that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards   federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities   we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental 8 laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 

insurance   we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period factors affecting our business and prospects   there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired   unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following    the strength of the united states economy has become increasingly susceptible to global events and threats of terrorism at the same time productivity enhancements and the increased exportation of labor have resulted in negligible job growth despite an improving economy continued weakness in job creation or any worsening of current economic conditions generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our stockholders   acquisitions or new development may not achieve anticipated results we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks  9   possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but market conditions could change and purchasers may not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable   increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied singleand multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents   insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints we cannot assure you that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit nor can we assure you that the full limits of our line of credit will be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so   failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to stockholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities    expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder   debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 10   financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing stockholders could be diluted   development and construction risks could impact our profitability we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks    construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability   failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others    changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates therefore if interest rates increase our interest costs will rise to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities   limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment 11 companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely affect our growth 

  failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability   interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges   potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property   we are subject to certain tax risks we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to qualify as a reit we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may apply to us potentially with retroactive effect and could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders we may receive significant nonqualifying income or acquire nonqualifying assets which as a result may cause us to approach the income and assets test limits imposed by the internal revenue code there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property   recent tax legislation could negatively impact our stock price in 2003 legislation was enacted that generally reduces the maximum capital gains rate for noncorporate taxpayers from 20 to 15 after may 5 2003 under the legislation the 15 rate is also applicable to “qualified dividend income” from 12 certain corporations in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the 15 tax rate except to the extent such dividends are attributable to dividends we received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries or to reit “capital gain dividends” as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 the recent legislation also reduces the maximum tax rate of noncorporate taxpayers on ordinary income from 386 to 35 

  although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits the more favorable treatment of regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to consider stock of other corporations that pay dividends as more attractive relative to stock of reits it is not possible to predict whether this change in perceived relative value will occur or what the effect will be on the market price of our stock   we may conduct a portion of our business through taxable reit subsidiaries which could have adverse tax consequences we have established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite our qualification as a reit our taxable reit subsidiaries must pay federal income tax on their taxable income in addition we must comply with various tests to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and our income from and investments in our taxable reit subsidiaries generally do not constitute permissible income and investments for these tests while we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect our reit qualification we cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result furthermore we may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or our taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent our dealings with our taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature   maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us which may not be in our stockholders’ best interests maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us as a maryland corporation we are subject to various maryland laws which may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire our company and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders’ best interests the maryland general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combination transactions between us and any person who acquires beneficial ownership of shares of our stock representing 10 or more of the voting power without our board of directors’ prior approval any such business combination transaction could not be completed until five years after the person acquired such voting power and generally only with the approval of stockholders representing 80 of all votes entitled to be cast and 66 23 of the votes entitled to be cast excluding the interested stockholder or upon payment of a fair price maryland law also provides generally that a person who acquires shares of our equity stock that represent 10 and certain higher levels of the voting power in electing directors will have no voting rights unless approved by a vote of twothirds of the shares eligible to vote   limitations on share ownership and limitations on the ability of our stockholders to effect a change in control of our company may prevent takeovers that are beneficial to our stockholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half of any taxable year our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain ownership and transfer restrictions relating to our stock primarily to assist us in complying with this requirement these restrictions include a provision that generally limits a person from beneficially owning or constructively owning shares of our outstanding equity stock in excess of a 99 ownership interest unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limitation provided that any such exemption shall not allow the person to exceed 13 of the value of our outstanding equity stock these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our stockholders or might otherwise be in our stockholders’ best interests   under the terms of our shareholder rights plan our board of directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15 of the outstanding shares of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the person’s purchase after that person acquires more than 15 of our outstanding 13 common stock all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value purchases by other stockholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person our board of directors however can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us

   we are a real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages middlemarket apartment communities nationwide we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation and we changed our state of incorporation from virginia to maryland in june 2003 our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships heritage communities lp a delaware limited partnership and united dominion realty lp a limited partnership which changed its state of organization from virginia to delaware in february 2004 unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” “the company” or “united dominion” refer collectively to united dominion realty trust inc and its subsidiaries 24   at december 31 2003 our portfolio included 264 communities with 76244 apartment homes nationwide the following table summarizes our market information by major geographic markets includes real estate held for disposition real estate under development and land but excludes commercial properties  

 

   liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment homes we 25 routinely use our unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities 

  we expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities we believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and longterm likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations   we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 1 billion in common shares preferred shares and debt securities to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets throughout 2003 we completed various financing activities under our 1 billion shelf registration statement these activities are summarized in the section titled “financing activities” that follows as of december 31 2003 approximately 5063 million of equity and debt securities remained available for use under the shelf registration statement access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance in january 2004 we sold 75 million of 513 senior unsecured notes due january 2014 under our 1 billion shelf registration statement the net proceeds of 739 million from the issuance were used to repay secured and unsecured debt obligations maturing in the first quarter of 2004   in july 2003 we entered into a sales agreement pursuant to which we may issue and sell through an agent up to a total of five million shares of common stock from time to time in “at the market offerings” as defined in rule 415 of the securities act of 1933 these sales will be made under our 1 billion shelf registration statement the sales price of the common stock will be no lower than the minimum price designated by us prior to the sale as of december 31 2003 we had not sold any shares of common stock pursuant to the sales agreement   in june 2003 moody’s investors service upgraded our rating outlook to positive from stable with senior unsecured debt rated at baa3 and preferred stock rated at ba1 in september 2003 standard  poor’s rating services upgraded the rating on our senior unsecured debt to bbb our preferred stock to bbb and our corporate credit rating to bbb stable outlook   in november 2003 we increased our mediumterm note program from 300 million to 500 million 

 

   future development expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through joint ventures with proceeds from the sale of property with construction loans and to a lesser extent with cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption or placement of secured andor unsecured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of property in nonstrategic markets   during 2004 we have approximately 468 million of secured debt and 1011 million of unsecured debt maturing and we anticipate repaying that debt with proceeds from borrowings under our secured or unsecured credit facilities or the issuance of new unsecured debt securities or equity 

 

   our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates these policies include those related to 1 capital expenditures 2 impairment of longlived assets 3 derivatives and hedging 26 activities and 4 real estate investment properties with respect to these critical accounting policies we believe that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

 

   in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we capitalize those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred   during 2003 531 million or 714 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of our communities excluding development and commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as hvac equipment roofs siding parking lots and other nonrevenue enhancing capital expenditures which aggregated 345 million or 464 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures including water submetering the initial installation of microwaves or washerdryers and extensive interior upgrades totaled 154 million or 207 per home and major renovations totaled 32 million or 43 per home for the year ended december 31 2003   the following table outlines capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs for all of our communities excluding real estate under development and commercial properties for the periods presented    total capital improvements increased 103 million or 151 per home in 2003 compared to 2002 we will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of our cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2004 are currently expected to be approximately 470 per home 

 

   we record impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions   we review the carrying value of our portfolio of assets on a regular basis during 2002 we pursued our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited as a result 25 apartment communities were placed under contract and two of these assets were ultimately sold at net selling prices 27 below their net book values accordingly we recorded an aggregate 23 million impairment loss for the write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in memphis tennessee in 2001 in connection with our analysis of the carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels we recognized an aggregate 28 million impairment loss on seven undeveloped sites in selected markets an impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets being greater than the estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal 

 

   we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2003 we had five interest rate swap agreements with a notional value aggregating 685 million that are used to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings furthermore should any change in management strategy or any other circumstance cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be required to be immediately reclassified from the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet to the income statement   interest rate swaps where we effectively make fixed rate payments and receive variable rate payments to eliminate our variable rate exposure are entered into to manage the interest rate risk in our existing balance sheet mix these instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future variable cash receipts and the discounted expected fixed cash payments the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest rates will impact our swap valuations the fair value of our existing swap portfolio is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest rates and shortening swap terms to maturity information about the fair values notional amounts and contractual terms of our interest rate swaps can be found in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled “interest rate risk” that follows   potential losses are limited to counterparty risk in situations where we are owed money that is when we hold contracts with positive fair values we do not expect any losses from counterparties failing to meet their obligations as the counterparties are highly rated credit quality us financial institutions and we believe that the likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote at december 31 2003 we had unrealized losses totaling 16 million on derivative transactions which if terminated would require a cash outlay we presently have no intention to terminate these contracts there are no credit concerns related to our obligations and we expect to meet those obligations without default 

 

   we purchase real estate investment properties from time to time and allocate the purchase price to various components such as land buildings and intangibles related to inplace leases and customer relationships in accordance with fasb statement no 141 “business combinations ” the purchase price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component the fair value of buildings is determined as if the buildings were vacant upon acquisition and subsequently leased at market rental rates as such the determination of fair value considers the present value of all cash flows expected to be generated from the property including an initial lease up period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by assessing the net effective rent and remaining term of the lease relative to market terms for similar leases at acquisition the fair value of inplace leases is recorded and amortized as amortization expense over the 28 remaining contractual lease period we determine the fair value of inplace leases by considering the cost of acquiring similar leases the foregoing rents associated with the leaseup period and the carrying costs associated with the leaseup period 

  the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating and financing activities and net cash used in investing activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 our cash flow provided by operating activities was 2349 million compared to 2290 million for 2002 during 2003 the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from a 158 million decrease in interest expense and an overall increase in operating liabilities primarily due to increased trade payables and an increase in unsecured interest payables as a result of different payment terms on new financings these increases in cash flow were partially offset by a 155 million decrease in property operating income resulting from the overall decrease in our apartment community portfolio see discussion under “apartment community operations” and a reduced level of collections on escrows due to lower refinancing activities 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash used in investing activities was 3042 million compared to 674 million for 2002 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects our strategy as it relates to our acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities all of which are discussed in further detail below 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 we acquired 3514 apartment homes in 11 communities for an aggregate consideration of 3477 million and one parcel of land for 31 million in addition we purchased the remaining 47 joint venture partners’ ownership interest in nine communities with 1706 apartment homes in salinas and pacific grove california for 760 million in june 2003   during the year ended december 31 2002 we acquired nine communities with 3041 apartment homes and one parcel of land for approximately 267 million in addition in june 2002 we purchased for approximately 52 million the remaining two apartment communities with 644 apartment homes that were part of an unconsolidated development joint venture in which we owned a 25 interest and served as the managing partner in august 2002 we purchased the outside partnership interest in two properties in california containing 926 apartment homes for approximately 17 million   consistent with our longterm strategic plan to achieve greater operating efficiencies by investing in fewer more concentrated markets over the last two years we have been expanding our interests in the fast growing southern california market during 2004 we plan to continue to channel new investments into those markets we believe will provide the best investment returns for us over the next ten years markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance expected job growth current and anticipated housing supply and demand and the ability to attract and support household formation 

 

   development activity is focused in core markets in which we have operations for the year ended december 31 2003 we invested approximately 136 million in development projects down 92 million from our 2002 level of 228 million 29   the following projects were under development as of december 31 2003    in addition we own six parcels of land that we continue to hold for future development that had a carrying value as of december 31 2003 of 78 million five of the six parcels represent additional phases to existing communities as we plan to add apartment homes adjacent to currently owned communities that are in improving markets   in december 2003 the mandolin ii a 178apartment home community located in dallas texas was completed total development costs for the project as of december 31 2003 were 122 million or 68500 per home the community was 652 leased at december 31 2003 

 

   in september 2002 we entered into a development joint venture with aegon usa realty advisors inc in which we serve as the managing member the joint venture is expected to develop approximately eight to ten gardenstyle apartment communities over the next three to five years with a total development cost of up to 210 million the joint venture will obtain bank construction financing for 65 to 80 of total costs and will provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with aegon providing 80 and us providing 20 we are serving as the developer general contractor and property manager for the joint venture and have guaranteed those project development costs excluding financing costs including fees and interest which exceed the defined project cost budgeted amounts for each respective project as they come to fruition we believe that the likelihood of funding guarantor obligations is remote and that the impact to us would be immaterial in june 2003 we contributed land with a carrying value of 38 million to the joint venture   as of december 31 2003 villa toscana a 504apartment home community located in houston texas was under development and total costs incurred as of december 31 2003 were 108 million budgeted costs for the project are estimated to be approximately 284 million or 56300 per apartment home the project is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 we sold seven communities with 1927 apartment homes for an aggregate consideration of 889 million one parcel of land for 13 million and two commercial properties for an aggregate consideration of 73 million we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 159 million on these sales proceeds from the sales were used primarily to reduce debt   for the year ended december 31 2002 we sold 25 communities with a total of 6990 apartment homes one commercial property and one parcel of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately 319 million and recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 315 million proceeds from the sales were applied primarily to acquire communities and reduce debt in addition during the first quarter of 2002 31 million in proceeds were received on the condemnation of 96 units of a community in fresno california that resulted in a gain of 12 million   during 2004 we plan to continue to pursue our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale we intend to use proceeds from 2004 dispositions to acquire communities fund development activity and reduce debt 30 

 

   net cash provided by financing activities during 2003 was 709 million compared to net cash used in financing activities in 2002 of 1631 million as part of the plan to improve our balance sheet we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity and debt offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and purchase new properties   the following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003  31  

 

   we have four secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 860 million and one with freddie mac for 72 million as of december 31 2003 6763 million was outstanding under the fannie mae credit facilities leaving 1837 million of unused capacity the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and can be extended for an additional five years at our discretion as of december 31 2003 707 million had been funded under the freddie mac credit facility leaving 13 million of unused capacity the freddie mac credit facility is for an initial term of five years with an option for us to extend for an additional fouryear term at the then market rate as of december 31 2003 aggregate borrowings under both the fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities were 747 million we have 3059 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 64 the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 17   we have a 500 million threeyear unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in march 2006 the credit facility replaces our 375 million unsecured revolver and 100 million unsecured term loan if we receive commitments from additional lenders or if the initial lenders increase their commitments we will be able to increase the credit facility to 650 million at our option the credit facility can be extended one year to march 2007 based on our current credit ratings the credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus 90 basis points as of december 31 2003 1379 million was outstanding under the credit facility leaving 3621 million of unused capacity   the fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 

 

   as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy we use derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of variable rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions our derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific financial instruments of the company we believe that we have appropriately controlled our interest rate risk through the use of derivative instruments during 2003 the fair value of our derivative instruments has improved from an unfavorable 96 million at december 31 2002 to an unfavorable 16 million at december 31 2003 this decrease is primarily due to the maturity and settlement of eight swaps in 2003 and the normal progression of the fair market value of derivative instruments towards zero as they approach expiration 

 

   we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issue these financial instruments to finance our portfolio of real estate assets interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate 32 sensitive assets and liabilities our earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact our cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of our market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under the unhedged portion of our fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities and our bank revolving credit facility which totaled 4412 million and 864 million respectively at december 31 2003 the impact on our financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2003 was immaterial 

  at december 31 2003 the notional value of our derivative products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was 685 million representing interest rate swaps under which we pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate these agreements effectively fix 685 million of our variable rate notes payable to a weighted average fixed rate of 81 at december 31 2003 the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was an unfavorable 16 million if interest rates were 100 basis points more or less at december 31 2003 the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have increased or decreased approximately 03 million   if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2004 than they did during 2003 our interest expense after considering the effects of our interest rate swap agreements would increase and income before taxes would decrease by 58 million comparatively if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2003 than in 2002 our interest expense after considering the effects of our interest rate swap agreements would have increased and income before taxes would have decreased by 53 million if market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2003 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from 157 billion to 146 billion if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31 2003 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 157 billion to 158 billion   these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements these analyses do not consider the effects of the adjusted level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude we would likely take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

 

   funds from operations “ffo” is defined as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trust’s “nareit” april 1 2002 white paper adjusted funds from operations “affo” is defined as ffo less recurring capital expenditures for our stabilized portfolio of 464 per home in 2003 and 425 per home in 2002 we consider ffo and affo in evaluating property acquisitions and our operating performance and believe that ffo and affo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance and liquidity ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs   historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical costs depreciation among other items from net income based on generally accepted accounting principles the use of ffo combined with the required presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results 33 of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful we generally consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies we believe that ffo and affo are the best measures of economic profitability for real estate investment trusts 

  the following table outlines our ffo calculation and reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles for the three years ended december 31 2003 dollars in thousands     in the computation of diluted ffo op units outperformance partnership shares and the shares of series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock and series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive therefore they are included in the diluted share count in 2003 distributions to preferred stockholders exclude 193 million related to a premium on preferred shares repurchased   gains on the disposition of real estate investments developed for sale is defined as net sales proceeds less a tax provision such development by reits must be conducted in a taxable reit subsidiary and the gross investment basis of the asset before accumulated depreciation we consider ffo with gains or losses on real estate developed for sale to be a meaningful supplemental measure of performance because of the shortterm use of funds to produce a profit that differs from the traditional longterm investment in real estate for reits 34   the following is a reconciliation of gaap gains on the disposition of real estate developed for sale to gross gains on the disposition of real estate developed for sale for the three years ended december 31 2003 dollars in thousands     ffo also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity additionally it is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs a presentation of cash flow metrics based on generally accepted accounting principles is as follows  dollars in thousands   

 

   the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

 

 

 

   net income available to common stockholders was 248 million 021 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 258 million 024 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2002 representing a decrease of 10 million 003 per diluted share the decrease in net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2003 when compared to the same period in the prior year resulted primarily from the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report    these decreases in income were offset by a 158 million decrease in interest expense in 2003 370 million less in prepayment penalties and premiums paid in 2003 for the refinancing of mortgage debt and the repurchase of unsecured debt and a 23 million impairment charge taken in 2002 related to a portfolio of properties in memphis tennessee 

 

   net income available to common stockholders was 258 million 024 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 271 million 027 per diluted share for the prior year the decrease in net income available to common stockholders resulted primarily from charges for prepayment penalties and premiums paid in 2002 in connection with the refinancing of mortgage debt and 35 the repurchase of unsecured debt aggregating 370 million before minority interests these charges were partially offset by the following items all of which are discussed in further detail elsewhere within this report 

 

 

   our net income is primarily generated from the operation of our apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating performance of our total apartment portfolio for each of the periods presented  dollars in thousands       the decrease in total property operating income since december 31 2002 is primarily due to an overall decrease in same community property operating income 

 

    our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2002 and held on december 31 2003 which consisted of 67814 apartment homes provided 89 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2003   for 2003 same community property operating income decreased 42 or 149 million compared to 2002 the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily attributable to a 18 or 99 million decrease in revenues from rental and other income and a 25 or 50 million increase in operating expenses the decrease in revenues from rental and other income was primarily driven by a 22 or 128 million decrease in rental rates this decrease in income was partially offset by an 117 or 17 million increase in submeter gas trash and utility reimbursements a 55 or 10 million decrease in concession expense and a 17 or 07 million decrease in vacancy loss physical occupancy remained constant at 932 for both 2003 and 2002   the increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 176 or 17 million increase in insurance costs a 43 or 14 million increase in utilities expense a 24 or 09 million increase in repair and maintenance costs a 39 or 08 million increase in administrative and marketing costs a 07 or 04 million increase in personnel costs and a 08 or 04 million increase in taxes all of which were partially offset by a 176 or 02 million decrease in incentive compensation 36   as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income decreased 16 to 617 

 

   the remaining 11 of our property operating income during 2003 was generated from communities that we classify as “nonmature communities” primarily those communities acquired or developed during 2002 and 2003 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 21 communities with 6935 apartment homes that we acquired during 2002 and 2003 provided 306 million of property operating income the seven communities with 1927 apartment homes sold during 2003 provided 46 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 972 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2002 provided 48 million of property operating income during 2003 the one community with 100 apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided 07 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities provided 17 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2003 

 

    our same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2001 and held on december 31 2002 which consisted of 66416 apartment homes provided 87 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2002   in 2002 same community property operating income decreased 08 or 28 million compared to the prior year the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily driven by a 171 or 56 million increase in vacancy loss and a 371 or 45 million increase in concessions these decreases in income were partially offset by a 328 or 34 million increase in submeter trash and vacant utility reimbursements a 03 or 17 million increase in rental rates and a 130 or 26 million increase in other income physical occupancy declined 08 to 933 in 2002 compared to 2001   for 2002 property operating expenses at these same communities increased 09 or 17 million compared to 2001 this increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 106 or 33 million increase in repair and maintenance costs and a 34 or 16 million increase in real estate taxes both of which were partially offset by a 51 or 17 million decrease in utilities expense a 402 or 09 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and a 95 or 10 million decrease in insurance costs   as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin decreased 04 to 633 

 

   the remaining 13 of our property operating income during 2002 was generated from our nonmature communities primarily those communities acquired or developed during 2001 and 2002 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 16 communities with 4989 apartment homes that we acquired during 2001 and 2002 provided 196 million of property operating income in addition our development communities which included 1238 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2001 provided 67 million of property operating income during 2002 the 25 communities with 6990 apartment homes sold during 2002 provided 181 million of property operating income the two communities with 363 apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided 19 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities provided 46 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2002 37 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 real estate depreciation and amortization on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 42 million or 27 compared to the same period in 2002 regardless of the decrease in the weighted average number of apartment homes experienced from december 31 2002 to december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to the newly acquired properties having a significantly higher per home cost compared to those properties that have been disposed of and other capital expenditures   during the year ended december 31 2002 real estate depreciation on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 73 million or 48 compared to 2001 the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment homes as well as the impact of completed development communities acquisitions and capital expenditures 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 158 million or 119 from 2002 primarily due to debt refinancings decreasing interest rates and an overall decrease in the weighted average level of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2003 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding decreased 11 or 239 million compared to the prior year and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 61 to 54 during 2003 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2003 is lower than 2002 primarily due to the high acquisition volume at the beginning of 2002 that was subsequently mitigated by high disposition activity in the second half of 2002 furthermore acquisition costs in 2003 that exceeded disposition proceeds were funded in most part by equity and op unit issuances the decrease in the average interest rate during 2003 reflects our ability to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt   for the year ended december 31 2002 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 114 million or 79 from 2001 primarily due to debt refinancings and decreasing interest rates that were partially offset by the overall increase in the weighted average level of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2002 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 20 or 404 million from 2001 levels and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 71 to 61 for 2002 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding during 2002 is higher than 2001 as we borrowed additional funds to acquire apartment communities the decrease in the average interest rate during 2002 reflects our ability to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt 

 

   for the year ended december 31 2003 general and administrative expenses increased 13 million or 66 over 2002 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense over the past two years we have shifted our longterm incentive reward system from stock options to restricted stock the cost of which is expensed quarterly during the vesting period   for the year ended december 31 2002 general and administrative expenses decreased 24 million or 110 compared to 2001 the decrease was primarily due to reduced personnel costs and state and local taxes that were partially offset by increased thirdparty consulting expenses 

 

   in 2003 we recognized a 14 million charge for the writeoff of our investment in realeum inc an unconsolidated development joint venture created to develop webbased solutions for multifamily property and portfolio management   in 2002 we pursued our strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and the redeployment of capital would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale during 2002 we 38 sold 25 apartment communities with a total of 6990 apartment homes one commercial property and one parcel of land with an aggregate net book value of approximately 285 million although these sales resulted in an aggregate net gain of 327 million certain of these assets were sold at net selling prices below their net book values as a result we recorded an aggregate 23 million impairment loss during 2002 for the write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in memphis tennessee 

 

   for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 159 million and 327 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

 

   in the second quarter of 2003 we exercised our right to redeem 20 million shares of our series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock upon receipt of our redemption notice the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 3076923 shares of common stock at a price of 1625 per share in december 2003 we redeemed an additional 40 million shares of our series d upon receipt of our redemption notice the shares to be redeemed were converted by the holder into 6154000 shares of common stock at a price of 1625 per share as a result we recognized a 193 million premium on preferred share repurchases during 2003 the premium amount recognized to convert these shares represents the cumulative accretion to date between the conversion value of the preferred stock and the value at which it was recorded at the time of issuance 

 

   we believe that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 

 

   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material 

 

   the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2003  dollars in thousands     during 2003 we incurred interest costs of 1190 million of which 18 million was capitalized 39

2002 accomplishments 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

business objectives and operating strategies 

  

our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our apartment communities to provide our shareholders with the greatest possible total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in 2001 management established a longterm strategy that resulted in certain fundamental conclusions and initial steps towards achieving our goals we believe that we must distinguish ourselves within the industry to maintain a leadership position over the longterm we believe an increased focus on being an excellent operator of apartment homes will be a compelling and successful business model to differentiate united dominion in the eyes of residents associates and investors with this strategy we believe that we can become the best in the multifamily industry based upon the following key principles 

  

   

   

   

we believe that over the longterm the fundamental principles of operational excellence middlemarket focus and proactive portfolio management will better position us to serve our residents increase profitability provide rewarding careers to our associates and capitalize on changes in the marketplace 

  

acquisitions and mergers 

  

acquisitions during the past five years we have increased our property portfolio by nearly 36000 apartment homes by acquiring other reits private portfolios and individual communities as part of our strategy 

  

to enhance our geographic diversification during the past four years our dispositions have exceeded acquisitions with acquisitions mostly utilizing disposition proceeds to complete section 1031 taxdeferred exchanges during 2002 using the proceeds from our disposition program and our equity offering we acquired nine communities with 3041 apartment homes and one parcel of land at a total cost of approximately 267 million including the assumption of debt and the use of taxfree exchange funds in addition we invested an additional 69 million to acquire the interests held by development and investment partners in four existing communities with a total of 1570 apartment homes 

  

when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

mergers the apartment sector of the real estate industry has undergone modest but steady consolidation over the past decade some apartment reits and privately owned portfolios may seek to be acquired by large well capitalized reits that have superior access to the capital markets in 1998 we participated in this consolidation process by completing the following mergers 

  

   

   

the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions including acquisitions through mergers during the past five years  dollars in thousands  

  

   

  

dispositions 

  

we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio profitability during 2002 we sold nearly 7000 of our slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets in an effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from the disposition program were used to acquire replacement communities fund development projects and to a lesser extent to reduce outstanding debt balances 

  

factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include 

  

   

   

   

   

at december 31 2002 there were two apartment communities two parcels of land and one commercial property classified as real estate held for disposition in addition we were actively marketing 17 apartment communities for sale in noncore markets we are in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings 

  

development and upgrading activities 

  

during 2002 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where there was an opportunity to add value and achieve greater than inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2002 we spent 317 million to finish 462 apartment homes in two additional phases to two existing communities in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures including water submetering the initial installation of microwaves or washerdryers and extensive interior upgrades totaled 94 million or 124 per home for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

in september 2002 we signed a development joint venture agreement with aegon usa realty advisors inc in which we serve as the managing member the joint venture is expected to develop approximately eight to ten garden style apartment communities over the next three to five years with a total development cost of up to 210 million the joint venture will obtain bank construction financing for 65 to 80 of total costs the joint venture will provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with aegon providing 80 and united dominion providing 20 we will serve as the developer general contractor and property manager for the joint venture and will guarantee those project development costs excluding financing costs including fees and interest which exceed the defined project cost budgeted amounts for each respective project as they come to fruition as of december 31 2002 the joint venture had not commenced operations 

  

we will continue to seek out development opportunities in our core markets and seek to raise equity with potential joint venture partners to start new development programs in 2003 we anticipate that any potential starts will occur in mid2003 until then we will strive to create value for the portfolio through rehabilitation of existing properties and phase ii opportunities within the existing portfolio 

  

financing activities 

  

as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and acquire apartment communities the following is a list of our major financing activities in 2002 

  

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

markets 

  

at december 31 2002 we owned apartment communities in 57 markets in 20 states of those markets 28 markets or 49 generated positive same community net operating income growth we have a geographically diverse portfolio and we believe that this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings 

  

we believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry over the next two decades in particular we believe the annual number of young people entering the workforce and creating households will be significantly higher over the next 10 to 15 years as compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 10 years the number of single people and single parent households continues to grow significantly there is also higher growth in immigration than had been expected each of these population segments has a high propensity to rent 

  

the weakness in the overall united states economy has adversely affected employment and other significant elements of the economy that drive productivity and the financial strength of business to maintain our occupancy levels during these economic conditions we have provided certain concessions to our residents 

  

moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this plan of operations coupled with the portfolio’s strengths in targeting the middlemarket of renters across a geographically diverse platform should position us for continued operational improvement 

  

communities 

  

at december 31 2002 our apartment portfolio included 260 communities having a total of 74480 completed apartment homes in addition we had 616 apartment homes under development the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved since 1998 with the disposition of noncore apartment homes 

  

and the upgrading of most of our communities the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces recurring capital expenditures per apartment home and therefore increases cash flow 

  

same communities 

  

our primary earnings driver is same apartment community operations during 2002 our same communities provided 87 of our property operating income in 2002 same community property operating income decreased 08 or 28 million compared to the prior year the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily driven by a 171 increase in vacancy loss and a 371 increase in concessions these decreases in income were partially offset by a 328 increase in submeter trash and vacant utility reimbursements a 03 increase in rental rates and a 130 increase in other income operating expenses increased by 09 much of which resulted from a 106 increase in repairs and maintenance costs and a 34 increase in real estate taxes both of which were partially offset by a 51 decrease in utilities expense a 402 decrease in incentive compensation expense and a 95 decrease in insurance costs 

  

average physical occupancy rental rates and operating margins at our same communities for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 are set forth below 

  

   

customers 

  

we focus on the broad middlemarket segment of the apartment market that generally consists of rentersbynecessity this group includes young professionals bluecollar families single parent households older singles immigrants nonrelated parties and families renting while waiting to purchase a home we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities 

  

we believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger renters over the next 10 to 15 years accordingly we plan to target some of our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger households these communities will often be located close to where young people work shop and play 

  

tax matters 

  

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate our income be derived primarily from real estate and that we distribute at least 90 of our taxable income other than our net capital gain to our shareholders provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we will generally not be subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is distributed to our shareholders 

  

competitive conditions 

  

in most of our markets competition for new residents is intense some competing communities offer features that our communities do not have some competing communities may use concessions or lower rents to obtain competitive advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our communities 

  

the competitive position of each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do 

  

management believes that in general we are wellpositioned to compete effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive advantages include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

inflation 

  

substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents and therefore cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive hedge against inflation 

  

environmental matters 

  

to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position however over the past 15 years the issue has been raised regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous materials in existing real estate properties and within the past year there has been an increase in the number of claims of potential healthrelated issues allegedly caused by the presence of mold in confined spaces we have a property management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each property we own in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at any of our properties management believes that through professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other hazardous materials coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with environmental hazards 

  

federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities 

  

  

we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties that individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position we have not been notified by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of operations future environmental laws regulations or ordinances however may require additional remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition to our knowledge we are in compliance with all applicable environmental rules and regulations 

  

insurance 

  

we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period 

  

factors affecting our business and prospects 

  

there are many factors that affect our business and our results of operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 

  

unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates market and economic conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the weakness in the united states economy has been exacerbated by the events of september 11 2001 as well as by the united states’ war on terrorism the weak economy has adversely affected employment and other significant elements of the economy that drive productivity and the financial strength of businesses any continuation or worsening of current economic conditions generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our shareholders 

  

acquisitions or new development may not achieve anticipated results we intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks 

  

   

  

   

   

possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational and financial flexibility we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives but market conditions could change and purchasers would not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable 

  

increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents our apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 

  

insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant restraints we cannot assure you that sufficient cash flow will be available to make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution requirements to maintain our status as a reit nor can we assure you that the full limits of our line of credit will be available to us if our operating performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we would otherwise not choose to do so 

  

failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments and distributions to shareholders if our apartment communities do not generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected the following factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our apartment communities 

  

   

   

   

   

   

expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from 

  

that community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgage holder 

  

debt level may be increased our current debt policy does not contain any limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional debt 

  

financing may not be available and could be dilutive our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests of our existing shareholders could be diluted 

  

development and construction risks could impact our profitability we intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks 

  

   

   

   

   

   

construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any increases in these costs may impair our profitability 

  

failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth we may from time to time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new markets these risks include among others 

  

   

   

   

   

  

changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our securities we currently have and expect to incur in the future debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates therefore if interest rates increase our interest costs will rise to the extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common and preferred stock and debt securities 

  

limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth  we expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely affect our growth 

  

failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability 

  

interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material charges 

  

potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs under various federal state and local environmental laws as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property 

  

compliance with reit share ownership limit may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half of any taxable year our charter includes provisions allowing us to stop transfers of and redeem our shares that are intended to assist us in complying with this requirement these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of control might involve a premium price for our shareholders or might otherwise be in our shareholders’ best interests 

  

we are subject to certain tax risks  we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to qualify as a reit we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis 

  

established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may apply to us potentially with retroactive effect and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit we may receive significant nonqualifying income or acquire nonqualifying assets which as a result may cause us to approach the income and assets test limits imposed by the internal revenue code there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

  

adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes may affect the tax treatment of our company or our shareholders or the value of our stock  the us federal income tax governing reits and other corporations or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time any of those new laws or interpretations thereof may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect our company or our shareholders on january 7 2003 the bush administration released a proposal that would exclude corporate dividends from a stockholder’s taxable income to the extent that the earnings from which the dividends are paid have been subject to corporate income tax reit dividends generally would not be exempt from income tax in the hands of a stockholder under the bush administration’s proposal in its current form because a reit’s income generally is not subject to corporatelevel tax however under the current proposal if a reit receives excludable dividend income from an investment in another corporation such as a taxable reit subsidiary the reit can pass that dividend income through to the reit’s stockholders without subjecting the stockholders to tax on that income if enacted the bush administration’s proposal could cause investors to view the stock of nonreit corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of reits than is the case currently there can be no assurance regarding the form in which this proposal ultimately will be enacted whether it will in fact be enacted or what effect if any its enactment may have on the value of our stock 

  

the ability of our shareholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited which may not be in our shareholders’ best interests under the terms of our shareholder rights plan our board of directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15 of the outstanding shares of our common stock unless our board of directors approves the person’s purchase after that person acquires more than 15 of our outstanding common stock all other shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value purchases by other shareholders would substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person our board of directors however can prevent the shareholder rights plan from operating in this manner this gives our board of directors significant discretion to approve or disapprove a person’s efforts to acquire a large interest in us

business overview 

  

united dominion is a real estate investment trust or reit that owns acquires renovates develops and manages middlemarket apartment communities nationwide we were formed in 1972 as a virginia corporation and our subsidiaries include two operating partnerships united dominion realty lp and heritage communities lp unless the context otherwise requires all references in this report to “we” “us” “our” or “united dominion” refer collectively to united dominion realty trust inc and its subsidiaries 

  

from 1996 through 1999 united dominion acquired other reits private portfolios and individual communities to create a national platform since that time we have upgraded the quality of our portfolio through capital reinvestment development divestitures and acquisitions and invested in infrastructure and technology to support our portfolio of assets in 2001 management established a longterm strategy that resulted in certain fundamental conclusions and initial steps towards achieving our goals 

  

we believe that we must distinguish ourselves within the industry to maintain a leadership position over the longterm we believe an increased focus on being an excellent operator of apartment homes will be a compelling and successful business model to differentiate united dominion in the eyes of residents associates and investors with this strategy we believe that we can become the best in the multifamily industry based upon the following key principles 

  

operational excellence —in short operational excellence is a way of doing business with consistent standard systems and business processes throughout our organization to provide customers residents 

  

and associates similar experiences regardless of location through operational excellence we believe that we can enhance our existing portfolio and new properties we seek to acquire deliver superior service to our residents and provide greater returns to our investors 

  

middlemarket —united dominion will focus efforts on owning and managing apartments that provide housing for customers who cannot typically afford an entrylevel home or customers who choose apartment living over other alternatives we will primarily serve the pricesensitive valueformoney customers in the broad middlemarket segments of the population 

  

portfolio management —we intend to continue to own and operate middlemarket apartment homes across a geographically diverse platform we believe that enhancing our presence in 25 to 30 core markets will enable us to capitalize on operating efficiencies as local market cycles create opportunities we intend to exit current markets where longterm growth is below the national average the “noncore markets” and redeploy capital within our core markets 

  

we believe that over the longterm the fundamental principles of operational excellence middlemarket focus and proactive portfolio management will better position united dominion to serve its residents increase profitability provide rewarding careers to our associates and capitalize on changes in the marketplace 

  

at december 31 2002 united dominion’s portfolio included 260 communities with 74480 apartment homes nationwide the following table summarizes united dominion’s market information by major geographic markets includes real estate held for disposition real estate under development and land but excludes commercial properties 

  

   

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity united dominion’s primary source of liquidity is its cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related to its portfolio of apartment homes united dominion routinely uses its unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the sale of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities 

  

united dominion expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements generally through its net cash provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements we expect to meet certain longterm liquidity requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the issuance of additional debt or equity securities of united dominion we believe that our net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by united dominion in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and longterm likewise the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations 

  

united dominion filed a shelf registration statement in december 1999 providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 700 million in common shares preferred shares and debt securities to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets under this shelf registration statement united dominion sold 30 million shares of common stock at a price of 1491 per share in march 2002 and issued 200 million of 650 senior unsecured notes due june 2009 in june 2002 in december 2002 united dominion replaced its existing shelf with a new shelf registration statement providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate of 1 billion in debt securities preferred stock and common stock and as a result the previous shelf registration will no longer be used for our securities offerings in january 2003 coinciding with our inclusion in the sp midcap 400 index united dominion sold 20 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of 1571 per share under the new shelf registration statement we received net proceeds from this offering of approximately 31 million which will be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes in february 2003 united dominion sold 150 million of 450 mediumterm notes due in march 2008 under a new 300 million mediumterm note program the net proceeds from the issuance of approximately 149 million are anticipated to be used to repay amounts outstanding on united dominion’s 375 million unsecured revolving credit facility access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of issuance 

  

future capital needs 

  

future development expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through joint ventures or with proceeds from the sale of property and to a lesser extent cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in strategic markets is expected to be largely financed through the issuance of equity and debt securities the issuance of operating partnership units the assumption of secured debt and by the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of property in nonstrategic markets 

  

during 2003 united dominion has approximately 195 million of secured debt and 1151 million of unsecured debt maturing that we anticipate repaying using proceeds from mortgage refinancing activity borrowings under secured or unsecured credit facilities or the issuance of new unsecured debt securities 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our critical accounting policies are those having the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results and those requiring significant judgments and estimates these policies include those related to 

  

1 capital expenditures 2 impairment of longlived assets and 3 derivatives and hedging activities with respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 

  

capital expenditures 

  

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states united dominion capitalizes those expenditures related to acquiring new assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 

  

during 2002 428 million or 563 per home was spent on capital expenditures for all of united dominion’s communities excluding development and commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital expenditures such as hvac equipment roofs landscaping siding parking lots and other nonrevenue enhancing capital expenditures which aggregated 323 million or 425 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures including water submetering the initial installation of microwaves or washerdryers and extensive interior upgrades totaled 94 million or 124 per home and major renovations totaled 11 million or 14 per home for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

the following table outlines capital expenditures and repairs and maintenance costs for united dominion’s total portfolio excluding real estate under development and commercial properties for the periods presented dollars in thousands 

  

   

total capital improvements decreased 103 million or 141 per home in 2002 compared to 2001 as challenging economic conditions negatively impacted our potential to generate investment returns united dominion will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which we believe will provide a return on investment substantially in excess of united dominion’s cost of capital recurring capital expenditures during 2003 are currently expected to be approximately 435 per home 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

  

united dominion records impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the future operation and disposition of those assets are less than the net book value of those assets our cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods the net book value of impaired assets is reduced to fair market value our estimates of fair market value represent our best estimate based upon industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

  

  

we review the carrying value of our portfolio of assets on a regular basis during 2002 united dominion pursued its strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited as a result 25 apartment communities were placed under contract and two of these assets were ultimately sold at net selling prices below their net book values accordingly united dominion recorded an aggregate 23 million impairment loss for the write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in memphis tennessee in 2001 in connection with management’s analysis of the carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels united dominion recognized an aggregate 28 million impairment loss on seven undeveloped sites in selected markets an impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets being greater than the estimated fair market value less the cost of disposal 

  

derivatives and hedging activities 

  

united dominion uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of december 31 2002 united dominion had 13 interest rate swap agreements with a notional value aggregating 232 million that are used to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings furthermore should any change in management strategy or any other circumstance cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception would be immediately reclassified from the shareholders’ equity section of the balance sheet to current earnings 

  

interest rate swaps where united dominion effectively makes fixed rate payments and receives variable rate payments to eliminate its variable rate exposure are entered into to manage the interest rate risk in our existing balance sheet mix these instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future variable cash receipts and the discounted expected fixed cash payments the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest rates will impact our swap valuations the fair value of our existing swap portfolio is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest rates and shortening swap terms to maturity information about the fair values notional amounts and contractual terms of united dominion’s interest rate swaps can be found in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled “interest rate risk” below 

  

potential losses are limited to counterparty risk in situations where united dominion is owed money that is when united dominion holds contracts with positive fair values we do not expect any losses from counterparties failing to meet their obligations as the counterparties are highly rated credit quality us financial institutions and management believes that the likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote at december 31 2002 united dominion had unrealized losses totaling 96 million on derivative transactions which if terminated would require a cash outlay united dominion presently has no intention to terminate these contracts there are no credit concerns related to our obligations and we expect to meet those obligations without default 

  

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing and financing activities that are presented in united dominion’s consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 united dominion’s cash flow provided by operating activities was 2267 million compared to 2244 million for 2001 during 2002 cash flow from operating activities resulted 

  

primarily from increased rental revenues from a larger portfolio and decreased interest expense that were partially offset by increased rental expenses lower collections on escrow accounts and receivables and increased payments of accrued incentive compensation 

  

investing activities 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash used in investing activities was 651 million compared to 641 million for 2001 changes in the level of investing activities from period to period reflects united dominion’s strategy as it relates to its acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities 

  

acquisitions 

  

during the year ended december 31 2002 united dominion acquired nine communities with 3041 apartment homes and one parcel of land for approximately 267 million in addition in june 2002 united dominion purchased for approximately 52 million the remaining two apartment communities with 644 apartment homes that were part of an unconsolidated development joint venture in which united dominion owned a 25 interest and served as the managing partner in august 2002 united dominion purchased the outside partnership interest in two properties in california containing 926 apartment homes for approximately 17 million 

  

during 2003 we plan to continue to channel new investments to those markets that are projected to provide the best investment returns for us over the next ten years markets will be targeted based upon defined criteria including past performance expected job growth current and anticipated housing supply and demand and the ability to attract and support household formation 

  

real estate under development 

  

development activity is focused in core markets that have strong operations in place for the year ended december 31 2002 united dominion invested approximately 228 million in development projects down 308 million from its 2001 level of 536 million 

  

the following projects were under development at december 31 2002 

  

   

in addition united dominion owns seven parcels of land that it continues to hold for future development that had a carrying value at december 31 2002 of 94 million six of the seven parcels represent additional phases to existing communities as united dominion plans to add apartment homes adjacent to currently owned communities that are in improving markets 

  

the following projects were completed during the year ended december 31 2002 

  

   

  

disposition of investments 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 united dominion sold 25 communities with a total of 6990 apartment homes one commercial property and one parcel of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately 319 million and recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 315 million proceeds from the sales were applied primarily to acquire communities and reduce debt in addition during the first quarter of 2002 31 million in proceeds was received on the condemnation of 96 units of a community in fresno california that resulted in a gain of 12 million for the year ended december 31 2001 united dominion sold nine communities with 1889 apartment homes and five parcels of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately 1413 million and recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 247 million proceeds from the sales were used primarily to repurchase united dominion’s 925 series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock during the second quarter of 2001 and to a lesser extent to reduce longterm debt repurchase common shares and to complete section 1031 exchanges to defer taxable gains 

  

during 2003 united dominion plans to continue to pursue its strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and redeploying capital into markets that would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale we intend to use proceeds from 2003 dispositions to acquire communities fund development activity and reduce debt 

  

development joint ventures 

  

in june 2000 united dominion completed the formation of a joint venture that would invest approximately 101 million to develop five apartment communities with a total of 1438 apartment homes united dominion owned a 25 interest in the joint venture and served as the managing partner of the joint venture as well as the developer general contractor and property manager for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 united dominion recognized fee income of approximately 06 million 26 million and 30 million respectively for general contracting developer and management services provided by united dominion to the joint venture in december 2001 united dominion purchased three of the five apartment communities for a total aggregate cost of approximately 61 million in june 2002 united dominion purchased the remaining two communities for a total aggregate cost of approximately 52 million 

  

in september 2002 united dominion signed a development joint venture agreement with aegon usa realty advisors inc in which united dominion serves as the managing member the joint venture is expected to develop approximately eight to ten garden style apartment communities over the next three to five years with a total development cost of up to 210 million the joint venture will obtain bank construction financing for 65 to 80 of total costs the joint venture will provide equity contributions for the balance of the costs with aegon providing 80 and united dominion providing 20 united dominion will serve as the developer general contractor and property manager for the joint venture and will guarantee those project development costs excluding financing costs including fees and interest which exceed the defined project cost budgeted amounts for each respective project as they come to fruition as of december 31 2002 the joint venture had not commenced operations 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities during 2002 was 1631 million compared to 1660 million for 2001 as part of the plan to improve united dominion’s balance sheet position we utilized proceeds from dispositions equity and debt offerings and refinancings to extend maturities pay down existing debt and purchase new properties 

  

the following is a summary of our financing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

management believes that these redemptions will generate a net present value savings of approximately 1 million to 3 million 

  

   

   

credit facilities 

  

united dominion has four secured revolving credit facilities with fannie mae with an aggregate commitment of 860 million and one with freddie mac for 72 million as of december 31 2002 6763 million was outstanding under the fannie mae credit facilities leaving 1837 million of unused capacity the fannie mae credit facilities are for an initial term of ten years bear interest at floating and fixed rates and can be extended for an additional five years at united dominion’s discretion as of december 31 2002 707 million had been funded under the freddie mac credit facility leaving 13 million of unused capacity the freddie mac credit facility is for an initial term of five years with an option by united dominion to extend for an additional fouryear term at the then market rate 

  

  

as of december 31 2002 the aggregate borrowings under both the fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities was 747 million we have 3059 million of the funded balance fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 64 the remaining balance on these facilities is currently at a weighted average variable rate of 20 

  

united dominion has a 375 million threeyear unsecured bank revolving credit facility that matures in august 2003 as of december 31 2002 1758 million was outstanding under the bank credit facility leaving 1992 million of unused capacity under the bank credit facility united dominion may borrow at a rate of libor plus 11 and pays an annual facility fee equal to 025 of the commitment 

  

the fannie mae and freddie mac credit facilities and the bank revolving credit facility are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations as of december 31 2002 management believes that united dominion is in compliance with all covenants and limitations 

  

derivative instruments 

  

as part of united dominion’s overall interest rate risk management strategy we use derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of variable rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions united dominion’s derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific financial instruments of united dominion united dominion believes that it has appropriately controlled its interest rate risk through the use of derivative instruments during 2002 the fair value of united dominion’s derivative instruments has improved from an unfavorable value position of 149 million at december 31 2001 to an unfavorable value position of 96 million at december 31 2002 this decrease is primarily due to the normal progression of the fair market value of derivative instruments to get closer to zero as they near the end of their terms see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

interest rate risk 

  

united dominion is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced united dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets united dominion’s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by our finance department interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities united dominion’s earnings are affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of united dominion’s market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under the unhedged portion of its fannie mae credit facilities and its bank revolving credit facility which totaled 3705 million and 707 million respectively at december 31 2002 the impact on united dominion’s financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2002 was immaterial 

  

at december 31 2002 the notional value of united dominion’s derivative products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was 232 million representing interest rate swaps under which united dominion pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate these agreements effectively fix 232 million of united dominion’s variable rate notes payable to a weighted average fixed rate of 772 at december 31 2002 the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was an unfavorable value position of 96 million if interest rates were 100 basis points more or less at december 31 2002 the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have increased or decreased approximately 19 million and 20 million respectively 

  

if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in 2003 than they did during 2002 united dominion’s interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements would increase and income before taxes would decrease by 53 million comparatively if market interest rates 

  

for variable rate debt had averaged 100 basis points more in 2002 than in 2001 united dominion’s interest expense after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements would have increased and income before taxes would have decreased by 52 million if market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2002 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from 138 billion to 133 billion if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31 2002 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 138 billion to 145 billion 

  

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on united dominion’s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in united dominion’s financial structure 

  

results of operations 

  

effective january 1 2002 united dominion adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “sfas no 144” “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” sfas no 144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include the components of an entity that have either been disposed of or are classified as held for disposition see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements during 2002 united dominion sold 25 communities one commercial property and one parcel of land and at december 31 2002 had five properties classified as real estate held for disposition accordingly the operating results of these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2002 the following discussion includes the results of both continuing and discontinued operations for the periods presented 

  

net income available to common shareholders 

2002vs2001 

  

net income available to common shareholders was 258 million 024 per share for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 271 million 027 per share for the prior year the decrease in net income available to common shareholders resulted primarily from nonrecurring charges incurred during 2002 these consisted primarily of extraordinary charges for prepayment penalties and premiums paid in connection with the refinancing of mortgage debt and the repurchase of unsecured debt aggregating 370 million before minority interests these nonrecurring charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as an extraordinary charge to earnings the increase in extraordinary charges was partially offset by higher gains recognized on the sales of depreciable property during 2002 compared to 2001 most of which are included in income from discontinued operations see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and nonrecurring charges in 2001 see discussion that follows under “restructuring charges” and “impairment loss on real estate and investments” in addition consolidated property operations generated 90 million more in rental income during 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of the continued leaseup and stabilization of development communities and interest expense decreased 114 million due to refinancing activities 

  

2001vs2000 

  

net income available to common shareholders was 271 million 027 per share for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 427 million 041 per share for 2000 representing a decrease of 156 million 014 per share excluding nonrecurring charges see discussion that follows under “restructuring charges” and “impairment loss on real estate and investments” and extraordinary items net 

  

income available to common shareholders was 415 million 041 per share for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 455 million 044 per share for 2000 representing a decrease of 40 million 004 per share excluding nonrecurring charges and extraordinary items the decrease for the period was primarily due to the overall decrease in united dominion’s portfolio of assets that generated rental income of 6186 million representing a decrease of 80 million from 2000 in addition united dominion recognized lower gains on the sale of land and depreciable property during 2001 and incurred the writeoff of unamortized original issuance costs associated with its 925 series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock during the second quarter of 2001 this decrease was moderated in part by a decrease in rental expenses of 42 million to 2462 million and lower interest costs of 1444 million during 2001 compared to 1560 million in 2000 

  

apartment community operations 

  

united dominion’s net income is primarily generated from the operation of its apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating performance of united dominion’s total apartment portfolio for each of the periods presented dollars in thousands 

  

     

the increase in property operating income provided by the same communities development communities and acquisition communities since december 31 2001 is primarily due to the continued leaseup and stabilization of development communities 

  

2002vs2001 

same communities 

  

united dominion’s same communities those communities acquired developed and stabilized prior to january 1 2001 and held on january 1 2002 which consisted of 66416 apartment homes at december 31 2002 provided 87 of our property operating income for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

in 2002 same community property operating income decreased 08 or 28 million compared to the prior year the overall decrease in property operating income was primarily driven by a 171 or 56 million increase in vacancy loss and a 371 or 45 million increase in concessions these decreases in income were partially offset by a 328 or 34 million increase in submeter trash and vacant utility reimbursements a 03 or 17 million increase in rental rates and a 130 or 26 million increase in other income physical occupancy declined 08 to 933 in 2002 compared to 2001 

  

for 2002 property operating expenses at these same communities increased 09 or 17 million compared to 2001 this increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by a 106 or 33 million increase in repairs and maintenance costs and a 34 or 16 million increase in real estate taxes both of which were partially offset by a 51 or 17 million decrease in utilities expense a 402 or 09 million decrease in incentive compensation expense and a 95 or 10 million decrease in insurance costs 

  

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income decreased 04 to 633 

  

  

nonmature communities 

  

the remaining 13 of united dominion’s property operating income during 2002 was generated from its nonmature communities those communities acquired or developed during 2001 and 2002 sold properties and those properties classified as real estate held for disposition the 16 communities with 4989 apartment homes acquired by united dominion during 2001 and 2002 provided 196 million of property operating income in addition united dominion’s development communities which included 1238 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2001 provided 67 million of property operating income during 2002 the 25 communities with 6990 apartment homes sold during 2002 provided 181 million of property operating income the two communities with 363 apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition provided 19 million of property operating income and other nonmature communities provided 46 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

2001vs2000 

same communities 

  

united dominion’s same communities those communities acquired developed or stabilized prior to january 1 2000 and held on january 1 2001 which consisted of 72997 apartment homes at december 31 2001 provided 95 of united dominion’s property operating income for the year ended december 31 2001 

  

in 2001 property operating income for the same communities increased 23 or 85 million compared to 2000 the growth in property operating income resulted from a 178 million or 31 increase in property rental income over the same period in the prior year the increase was driven by a 229 million or 39 increase in rental rates the increased rental rates were partially offset by higher concessions and an increase in bad debt expense physical occupancy decreased 02 to 940 in 2001 compared to 2000 

  

for 2001 property operating expenses at these same communities increased 93 million or 45 compared to 2000 the increase in property operating expenses resulted primarily from a 36 million or 111 increase in utility costs experienced by united dominion as a result of the increase in prices for natural gas and overall increases in electricity costs in addition united dominion experienced a 24 million or 73 increase in repairs and maintenance a 16 million or 31 increase in taxes and a 12 million or 21 increase in personnel costs compared to 2000 

  

as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by property rental income decreased 05 to 632 

  

nonmature communities 

  

the remaining 5 of united dominion’s property operating income during 2001 was generated from its nonmature communities those communities acquired or developed during 2000 and 2001 and sold properties the six communities with 1571 apartment homes acquired by united dominion during 2000 and 2001 provided an additional 38 million of property operating income during 2001 in addition united dominion’s development communities which included 2022 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2000 provided an additional 95 million of property operating income for the year ended december 31 2001 and the nine communities with 1889 apartment homes sold in 2001 provided 25 million of property operating income during 2001 

  

real estate depreciation 

  

during the year ended december 31 2002 real estate depreciation on both continuing and discontinued operations increased 73 million or 48 compared to 2001 the increase in depreciation expense was attributable to the overall increase in the weighted average number of apartment homes as well as the impact of completed development communities acquisitions and capital expenditures 

  

  

during the year ended december 31 2001 real estate depreciation on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 11 million or 08 compared to 2000 the decrease in depreciation expense was attributable to the overall decrease in the weighted average number of apartment homes partially offset by the impact of completed development communities acquisitions and capital expenditures 

  

interest expense 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 interest expense on both continuing and discontinued operations decreased 114 million or 79 from 2001 primarily due to debt refinancings and decreasing interest rates that were partially offset by the overall increase in the weighted average level of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2002 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding increased 20 or 404 million from 2001 levels and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 71 to 61 for 2002 the weighted average amount of debt employed during 2002 is higher than 2001 as we borrowed additional funds to acquire apartment communities the decrease in the average interest rate during 2002 reflects the ability of united dominion to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt 

  

for the year ended december 31 2001 interest expense decreased 117 million from the corresponding amount in 2000 primarily due to decreasing interest rates and to a lesser extent the overall decrease in the level of debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2001 the weighted average amount of debt outstanding decreased 29 or 602 million from 2000 levels and the weighted average interest rate decreased from 76 in 2000 to 71 in 2001 the weighted average amount of debt employed during 2001 is lower as a portion of disposition proceeds was used to repay outstanding debt the decrease in the average interest rate during 2001 reflects the ability of united dominion to take advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization of variable rate debt 

  

restructuring charge 

  

in 2001 management undertook a comprehensive review of the organizational structure of united dominion and its operations subsequent to the appointment of a new senior management team and ceo as a result we recorded 45 million of expense related to the termination of approximately 10 of united dominion’s workforce in operations and at the corporate headquarters in addition united dominion recognized expense in the aggregate of 09 million related to relocation costs associated with the new executive offices in colorado and other miscellaneous costs 

  

impairment loss on real estate and investments 

  

in 2002 united dominion pursued its strategy of exiting markets where longterm growth prospects are limited and the redeployment of capital would enhance future growth rates and economies of scale during 2002 united dominion sold 25 apartment communities with a total of 6990 apartment homes one commercial property and one parcel of land with an aggregate net book value of approximately 285 million although these sales resulted in an aggregate net gain of 315 million certain of these assets were sold at net selling prices below their net book values as a result united dominion recorded an aggregate 23 million impairment loss during 2002 for the write down of a portfolio of apartment communities in memphis tennessee 

  

in 2001 in connection with the evaluation of united dominion’s real estate assets and operations senior management determined that it was in our best interest to dispose of a majority of united dominion’s undeveloped tracts of land at an accelerated pace and redeploy the proceeds elsewhere this represented a change from prior management in the holding period of these assets and their respective values prior management had purchased these tracts of land in 1999 and 2000 with the intent to build apartment communities on them to accelerate the disposition of these undeveloped land sites we recorded an aggregate 28 million impairment loss during the first quarter of 2001 for the write down of seven undeveloped sites in selected markets the 28 million charge represented the discount necessary to dispose of these assets in a short time frame coupled with decreases in market value in 2001 for these properties in addition united dominion recognized a 04 million charge for the write down of its investment in an online apartment leasing company 

  

  

during the fourth quarter of 2001 realeum inc a property management software venture in which united dominion made significant investments prior to 2001 successfully completed an equity offering in which it raised approximately 15 million of new capital in exchange for a 456 ownership stake as a result of the equity offering the market value of united dominion’s ownership stake was established at approximately 13 million and its 35 million aggregate investment was adjusted to 13 million 

  

general and administrative 

  

for the year ended december 31 2002 general and administrative expenses decreased 24 million or 110 compared to 2001 the decrease was primarily due to reduced personnel costs and state and local taxes that were partially offset by increased thirdparty consulting expenses 

  

for the year ended december 31 2001 general and administrative expenses increased 60 million or 382 compared to 2000 the increase was primarily due to an increase in costs related to incentive compensation employee benefits and state and local taxes 

  

gains on sales of land and depreciable property 

  

for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 united dominion recognized gains for financial reporting purposes of 327 million and 247 million respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of united dominion’s divestiture activity from period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold 

  

inflation 

  

united dominion believes that the direct effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial substantially all of united dominion’s leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation

     or 1367 per share

    we acquired five communities with 1304 apartment homes and one parcel of
     land at a total cost of approximately 926 million which included the
     use of tax free exchange funds

    we hired thomas w toomey as our chief executive officer to succeed john
     p mccann who had served in this role for more than 26 years upon

     structure we hired several new senior executives opened a new executive
     office near denver colorado and streamlined our workforce

business objectives and operating strategies

   our principal business objective is to maximize the economic returns of our
apartment communities to provide our shareholders with the greatest possible
total return and value to achieve this objective we intend to continue to
pursue the following goals and strategies

    own and operate middle market apartments across a national platform thus
     enhancing stability and predictability of returns to our shareholders

    manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying
     selling and building apartment communities

    empower site associates to manage our communities efficiently and
     effectively

    measure and reward associates based on specific performance targets and

    manage the capital structure to ensure predictability of earnings and
     dividends

   to further our goal of being one of the largest apartment reits we have
continued to focus on upgrading our portfolio and improving our operations in
an effort to sustain aboveaverage net operating income growth steadily
increase cash flow per apartment home and strengthen our capital structure

acquisitions and mergers

   acquisitions  during the past five years we have increased our property
portfolio by nearly 40000 apartment homes by acquiring other reits private
portfolios and individual communities as part of our strategy to enhance our
geographic diversification during the past three years our dispositions have
exceeded acquisitions with acquisitions mostly utilizing disposition proceeds
to complete section 1031 taxdeferred exchanges during 2001 using the
proceeds from our disposition program and our equity offering we acquired five
communities with 1304 apartment homes and one parcel of land at a total cost
of 926 million including the assumption of debt and the use of tax free
exchange funds

   when evaluating potential acquisitions we consider

    population growth cost of alternative housing overall potential for
     economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in
     which the property is located

    geographic location and type of community including proximity to our
     existing communities which can deliver significant economies of scale

    construction quality condition and design of the community

    current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to
     increase cash flow

    potential for capital appreciation of the property

                                      3

    ability to increase the value and profitability of the property through
     upgrades and repositioning

    terms of resident leases including the potential for rent increases

    occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the
     vicinity

    prospects for liquidity through sale financing or refinancing of the
     property and

    competition from existing multifamily communities and the potential for
     the construction of new multifamily properties in the area

   mergers  the apartment sector of the real estate industry has undergone
modest but steady consolidation over the past decade some apartment reits and
privately owned portfolios may seek to be acquired by large well capitalized
reits that have superior access to the capital markets we have participated in
this consolidation process by completing the following mergers

    on december 31 1996 we acquired southwest property trust inc in a
     statutory merger southwest was a publicly traded multifamily reit that
     owned 44 communities with 14320 apartment homes primarily located in
     texas the merger provided us with diversification beyond our traditional
     southeast and midatlantic markets and into the southwestern markets

    on march 27 1998 we acquired asr investments corporation in a statutory
     merger asr was a publicly traded multifamily reit that owned 39
     communities with 7550 apartment homes located in arizona texas new
     mexico and the state of washington the merger furthered our investment in
     southwestern markets provided an initial presence in the pacific
     northwest and added communities in houston and phoenix

    on december 7 1998 we acquired american apartment communities ii inc
     or aac in a statutory merger in connection with this acquisition we
     acquired 53 communities with 14001 apartment homes located primarily in
     california the pacific northwest the midwest and florida the merger
     enabled us to enter new major markets many of which are strong growth
     markets through the merger we entered portland san francisco
     sacramento san jose monterey los angeles denver indianapolis and
     detroit in addition aac added communities to our portfolios in columbus
     tampa south florida and seattle

   the following table summarizes our apartment acquisitions including
acquisitions through mergers during the last five years dollars in thousands

dispositions

   we regularly monitor and adjust our assets to increase portfolio
profitability during the past three years we sold more than 15000 of our
slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets in an
effort to increase the quality and performance of our portfolio proceeds from
the disposition program were used to strengthen our capitalization structure by
paying down debt as well as to fund development projects acquire replacement
communities and to selectively repurchase shares of our preferred and common
stock

   factors we consider in deciding whether to dispose of a property include

    current market pricing for an asset compared to projected economics for
     that asset

    potential increases in new construction in the market area

    areas where the economy is not expected to grow substantially and

    markets where we do not intend to establish longterm concentration

   at december 31 2001 there were four parcels of land in lowperforming
markets classified as real estate held for disposition in addition we were
actively marketing 33 apartment communities for sale in similar markets we are
in the market for replacement properties that will correspond with our expected
sales activity to prevent dilution to earnings

development and upgrading activities

   during 2001 we continued to reposition properties in targeted markets where
there was a perceived opportunity to add value and achieve greater than
inflationary increases in rents over the long term in 2001 we spent 515
million to finish 776 apartment homes in two new communities and a phase three
to an existing community in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures
including water submetering gating and access systems the addition of
microwaves washerdryers interior upgrades and new business and fitness
centers totaled 216 million or 286 per home for the year ended december 31
2001

   we will continue to seek out development opportunities in our core markets
and seek to raise equity with potential joint venture partners to start a new
development program in 2002 we anticipate that any potential starts would
occur towards the end of 2002 until then we will strive to create value for
the portfolio through rehabilitation of existing properties and phase ii
opportunities within the existing portfolio

financing activities

   as part of our plan to strengthen our capital structure we used a majority
of our disposition proceeds in 2001 to reduce debt and repurchase shares of our
outstanding common and preferred stock the following is a list of our major
financing activities in 2001

    we redeemed all of our 925 series a cumulative redeemable preferred
     shares at 25 per share plus accrued interest

    we negotiated a 200 million secured credit facility with arcs commercial
     mortgage co lp or arcs a fannie mae dus lender

    we negotiated a 400 million secured credit facility through arcs with the
     funds earmarked to refinance existing debt on over 30 properties

    we repurchased 17600 share of our series b preferred stock at an average
     price of 2442 per share and 3768704 shares of our common stock and
     operating partnership units at an average price of 1321 for a total cost
     of 502 million

    we sold 41 million shares of our common stock in a public offering and
     received net proceeds of approximately 56 million from the offering

markets

   at december 31 2001 we owned apartment communities in 62 markets in 21
states of those markets 45 markets or 73 generated positive same community
net operating income growth we have a geographically diverse portfolio and we
believe this diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the
risk associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby
increasing the stability and predictability of our earnings

                                      5

page

   in 2001 new supply continued to come into the market as demand was slowing
the excess supply exerted pressure on occupancy in some of our key markets
particularly in charlotte raleigh atlanta and orlando offsetting this some
of our markets experienced aboveaverage net operating income growth for the
year including seattle dallasfort worth baltimore norfolk and metropolitan
dc our west coast markets including our markets in california and the pacific
northwest were exceptionally strong throughout the year

   we believe changing demographics will have a significant impact on the
apartment industry over the next two decades in particular we believe the
annual number of young people entering the workforce and creating households
will be significantly higher over the next 15 years as compared to the number
who entered the workforce over the past 10 years the number of single people
and single parent households continues to grow significantly there is also
higher growth in immigration than had been expected each of these population
segments has a high propensity to rent

   many economists believe the united states economy is currently in recession
the weakness in the overall united states economy was exacerbated by the events
of september 11 2001 the recession has adversely affected employment and
other significant elements of the economy that drive productivity and the
financial strength of business to maintain our occupancy levels during these
economic conditions we have provided certain concessions to our residents and
we have increased our bad debt allowance

   moving forward we will continue to emphasize aggressive lease management
expense control increased resident retention efforts and the realignment of
employee incentive plans tied to our bottom line performance we believe this
plan of operations coupled with the portfolios strengths in targeting the
middle market of renters across a geographically diverse platform should
position us for continued operational improvement

communities

   at december 31 2001 our apartment portfolio included 274 communities
having a total of 77567 completed apartment homes in addition we had 462
apartment homes under development at two additional phases to existing owned
communities the overall quality of our portfolio has significantly improved
since 1997 with the disposition of noncore apartment homes and the upgrading
of most of our communities the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key
benefits related to portfolio profitability it enables us to raise rents more
significantly and to attract residents with higher levels of disposable income
who are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses such as water and sewer
costs from the landlord to the resident in addition it potentially reduces
recurring capital expenditures per apartment and therefore increases cash flow

same communities

   our primary earnings driver is same apartment community operations during
2001 our same communities provided 95 of our property operating income
rental growth was 31 and resulted primarily from a 39 increase in rental
rates offset by a 02 decrease in physical occupancy higher concessions and
an increase in bad debt expense operating expenses also grew by 44 much of
which resulted from a 106 increase in electricity costs and a 94 increase
in repair and maintenance

   average physical occupancy rental rates and operating margins at our same
communities during the past three years are set forth below



                                            2001   2000   1999

customers

   we focus on the broad middlemarket segment of the apartment market that
generally consists of rentersbynecessity this group includes young
professionals bluecollar families single parent households older singles
immigrants nonrelated parties and families renting while waiting to purchase
a home we believe this segment provides the highest profit potential in terms
of rent growth stability of occupancy and investment opportunities

   we believe there will be a significant increase in the number of younger
renters over the next decade and a half accordingly we plan to target some of
our incremental investments to communities that will be attractive to younger
households these communities will often be located close to where young people
work shop and play

tax matters

   we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to
continue to qualify as a reit we must continue to meet certain tests which
among other things generally require that our assets consist primarily of real
estate our income be derived primarily from real estate and that we distribute
at least 90 of our taxable income other than our net capital gain to our
shareholders provided we maintain our qualification as a reit we will
generally not be subject to federal income taxes at the corporate level on our
net income to the extent net income is distributed to our shareholders

   the reit modernization act or rma which took effect in 2001 contains
several provisions that allow reits to compete more effectively in the real
estate industry by allowing reits to offer the same types of services as
nonreit competitors in the marketplace the most important feature of the rma
is the allowance for reits to create taxable reit subsidiaries or trs that
can provide services to residents and others without disqualifying the rents
that a reit receives from its residents

   prior to the rma reits were not allowed to provide noncustomary or tenant
specific services to their residents such as concierge services beyond a de
minimus amount as the apartment industry has become a competitive
customerfocused business these constraints inhibited reits from maintaining a
competitive edge in attracting and maintaining residents therefore the rma
has several significant benefits for the reit industry reits will be allowed
through a trs to provide a wide range of increasingly important services that
residents have come to expect generating new sources of income for reit
shareholders

   effective january 1 2001 reits can own 100 of the stock of a trs
however the legislation contains a number of safeguards that would limit the
size of a trs to ensure that reits remain focused on their core business of
owning and operating real estate assets the rma provides another significant
change to the existing law the rma changes the minimum distribution
requirement from 95 to 90 of the reits taxable income this allows reits to
retain a greater level of capital that can be used to invest in expenditures to
maintain the quality of their real estate assets as well as repay outstanding
debt

   we do not currently have any trss however we are evaluating opportunities
to take advantage of this legislation

competitive conditions

   in most of our markets competition for new residents is intense some
competing communities offer features that our communities do not have some
competing communities may use concessions or lower rents to obtain competitive
advantages also some competing communities are larger or newer than our
communities the competitive position of each community is different depending
upon many factors including submarket supply and demand in addition other
real estate investors compete with us to acquire existing properties and to
develop new properties these competitors include insurance companies pension
and investment funds

                                      7

page

developer partnerships investment companies and other apartment reits this
competition could increase prices for properties of the type that we would
likely pursue and our competitors may have greater resources than we do

   management believes that in general we are wellpositioned to compete
effectively for residents and investments we believe our competitive
advantages include

    a fully integrated organization with property management development
     acquisition marketing and financing expertise

    scalable operating and support systems

    purchasing power

    geographic diversification with a presence in more than 62 markets across
     the country and

    local presence in many of our major markets which allows us to be a local
     operating expert

inflation

   substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less which
may enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the
beginning of new leases such shortterm leases generally minimize the risk to
us of the adverse effects of inflation although as a general rule these leases
permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty
shortterm leases and relatively consistent demand allow rents and therefore
cash flow from the portfolio to provide an attractive hedge against inflation

environmental matters

   to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection
regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings
or competitive position however over the past 15 years the issue has been
raised regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous materials in
existing real estate properties and within the past year there has been an
increase in the number of claims of potential healthrelated issues allegedly
caused by the presence of mold in confined spaces we have a property
management plan for hazardous materials as part of the plan phase i
environmental site investigations and reports have been completed for each
property we own in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to
acquisition the inspections are conducted by qualified environmental
consultants and we review the issued report prior to the purchase or
development of any property nevertheless it is possible that our
environmental assessments will not reveal all environmental liabilities or
that some material environmental liabilities exist of which we are unaware in
some cases we have abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions
because the costs of removal or control of hazardous materials have been
prohibitive or we have been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved
we do not believe we will be required to engage in any largescale abatement at
any of our properties management believes that through professional
environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and other
hazardous materials coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting known
risk we can minimize our exposure to potential liability associated with
environmental hazards

   federal legislation requires owners and landlords of residential housing
constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers of
the communities any known lead paint hazards and imposes treble damages for
failure to provide such notification in addition lead based paint in any of
the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that
community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and we
may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused by ingestion
of lead based paint by children living at the communities

   we are unaware of any environmental hazards at any of our properties which
individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on our
operations or financial position we have not been notified

                                      8

page

by any governmental authority and we are not otherwise aware of any material
noncompliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
connection with any of our properties we do not believe that the cost of
continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations will
have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition or results of
operations we cannot assure you however that future environmental laws
regulations or ordinances will not require additional remediation of existing
conditions that are not currently actionable also if more stringent
requirements are imposed on us in the future the costs of compliance could
have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition to the best
of our knowledge we are in compliance with all applicable environmental rules
and regulations

insurance

   we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities with
limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability
claims and related defense costs we are also insured in all material
respects against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to
reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or
rebuild each property including loss of rental income during the
reconstruction period

factors affecting our business and prospects

   there are many factors that affect our business and our results of
operations some of which are beyond our control the following is a
description of some of the important factors that may cause our actual results
of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently
expected or desired

   unfavorable changes in apartment market and economic conditions could
adversely affect occupancy levels and rental rates  market and economic
conditions in the metropolitan areas in which we operate may significantly
affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our profitability
factors that may adversely affect these conditions include the following

    a reduction in jobs and other local economic downturns

    declines in mortgage interest rates making alternative housing more
     affordable

    oversupply of or reduced demand for apartment homes

    declines in household formation and

    rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating rental
     housing which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in
     operating costs

   the weakness in the united states economy has been exacerbated by the events
of september 11 2001 as well as by the united states war on terrorism the
weak economy has adversely affected employment and other significant elements
of the economy that drive productivity and the financial strength of
businesses any continuation or worsening of current economic conditions
generally and in our principal market areas could have a material adverse
effect on our occupancy levels our rental rates and our ability to
strategically acquire and dispose of apartment communities this may impair our
ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to our
shareholders

   acquisitions or new development may not achieve anticipated results  we
intend to continue to selectively acquire apartment communities that meet our
investment criteria our acquisition activities and their success are subject
to the following risks

    an acquired community may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our
     investment or a significant exposure related to the acquired property may
     go undetected during our due diligence procedures

                                      9

page

    when we acquire an apartment community we often invest additional amounts
     in it with the intention of increasing profitability these additional
     investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability

    new developments may not achieve pro forma rents or occupancy levels or
     problems with construction or local building codes may delay initial
     occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community

   possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit operational
and financial flexibility   we periodically dispose of apartment communities
that no longer meet our strategic objectives but market conditions could
change and purchasers would not be willing to pay prices acceptable to us a
weak market may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response
to changing economic conditions furthermore a significant portion of the
proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order
for some sales to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the
internal revenue code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for
federal income tax purposes as a result we may not have immediate access to
all of the cash flow generated from our property sales in addition federal
tax laws limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities that we have
owned for fewer than four years and this limitation may prevent us from
selling communities when market conditions are favorable

   increased competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or
increase or maintain rents  our apartment communities compete with numerous
housing alternatives in attracting residents including other apartment
communities and singlefamily rental homes as well as owner occupied single
and multifamily homes competitive housing in a particular area could
adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and increase or maintain
rents

   insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create
refinancing risk   we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt
financing including the risk that our operating income and cash flow will be
insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or could
restrict our borrowing capacity under our line of credit due to debt covenant
restraints we cannot assure you that sufficient cash flow will be available to
make all required principal payments and still satisfy our distribution
requirements to maintain our status as a reit nor can we assure you that the
full limits of our line of credit will be available to us if our operating
performance falls outside the constraints of our debt covenants additionally
we are likely to need to refinance substantially all of our outstanding debt as
it matures we may not be able to refinance existing debt or the terms of any
refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt which
could create pressures to sell assets or to issue additional equity when we
would otherwise not choose to do so

   failure to generate sufficient revenue could impair debt service payments
and distributions to shareholders  if our apartment communities do not
generate sufficient net rental income to meet rental expenses our ability to
make required payments of interest and principal on our debt securities and to
pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected the following
factors among others may affect the net rental income generated by our
apartment communities

    the national and local economies

    local real estate market conditions such as an oversupply of apartment
     homes

    tenants perceptions of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our
     communities and the neighborhoods where they are located

    our ability to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance and

    rental expenses including real estate taxes and utilities

                                      10

page

   expenses associated with our investment in a community such as debt
service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not
reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from that
community if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are
unable to make the mortgage payments we could sustain a loss as a result of
foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagee

   debt level may be increased  our current debt policy does not contain any
limitations on the level of debt that we may incur although our ability to
incur debt is limited by covenants in our bank and other credit agreements we
manage our debt to be in compliance with these debt covenants but subject to
compliance with these covenants we may increase the amount of our debt at any
time without a concurrent improvement in our ability to service the additional
debt

   financing may not be available and could be dilutive  our ability to
execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of
debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured
and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred
equity debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or
on favorable terms or at all if we issue additional equity securities to
finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt the interests
of our existing shareholders could be diluted

   development and construction risks could impact our profitability  we
intend to continue to develop and construct apartment communities development
activities may be conducted through whollyowned affiliated companies or
through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties our development and
construction activities may be exposed to the following risks

    we may be unable to obtain or face delays in obtaining necessary zoning
     landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and
     authorizations which could result in increased development costs and
     could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a
     project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations

    if we are unable to find joint venture partners to help fund the
     development of a community or otherwise obtain acceptable financing for
     the developments our development potential may be limited

    we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to
     explore and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in
     connection with exploring them

    we may be unable to complete construction and leaseup of a community on
     schedule or incur development or construction costs that exceed our
     original estimates and we may be unable to charge rents that would
     compensate for any increase in such costs

    occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate
     depending on a number of factors including market and economic
     conditions preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that
     community

   construction costs have been increasing in our existing markets and the
costs of upgrading acquired communities have in some cases exceeded our
original estimates we may experience similar cost increases in the future our
inability to charge rents that will be sufficient to offset the effects of any
increases in these costs may impair our profitability

   failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth  we may from time to
time make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate
opportunities arise we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to
enter new markets and we may not be able to operate successfully in new
markets these risks include among others

    inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and
     local economies

                                      11

page

    inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate
     acquisition opportunities

    inability to hire and retain key personnel and

    lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures

   changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the
market price of our securities   we currently have and expect to incur in the
future debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates
therefore if interest rates increase our interest costs will rise to the
extent our variable rate debt is not hedged effectively in addition an
increase in market interest rates may lead our security holders to demand a
higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our
common and preferred stock and debt securities

   limited investment opportunities could adversely affect our growth  we
expect that other real estate investors will compete with us to acquire
existing properties and to develop new properties these competitors include
insurance companies pension and investment funds developer partnerships
investment companies and other apartment reits this competition could increase
prices for properties of the type that we would likely pursue and our
competitors may have greater resources than we do as a result we may not be
able to make attractive investments on favorable terms which could adversely
affect our growth

   failure to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create
inefficiencies  to grow successfully we must be able to apply our experience
in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number
of properties in addition we must be able to integrate new management and
operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity failures
in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our
expected return on our investments and our overall profitability

   interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in
material charges  from time to time when we anticipate issuing debt
securities we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into
interest rate hedging contracts we may do this to increase the predictability
of our financing costs also from time to time we may rely on interest rate
hedging contracts to limit our exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable
changes in market interest rates if the pricing of new debt securities is not
within the parameters of or market interest rates produce a lower interest
cost than that which we incur under a particular interest rate hedging
contract the contract is ineffective furthermore the settlement of interest
rate hedging contracts has involved and may in the future involve material
charges

   potential liability for environmental contamination could result in
substantial costs  under various federal state and local environmental laws
as a current or former owner or operator of real estate we could be required
to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or
formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances often regardless
of our knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by
virtue of our current or former ownership or operation of the real estate in
addition we could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third
parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred
in connection with the contamination these costs could be substantial and in
many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities
to secure their payment the presence of such substances or a failure to
properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely
affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property

   compliance with reit share ownership limit may prevent takeovers beneficial
to shareholders  one of the requirements for maintenance of our qualification
as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than 50 in value of
our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals
including entities specified in the internal revenue code during the last half
of any taxable year our charter includes provisions allowing us to stop
transfers of and redeem our shares that are intended to assist us in complying
with

                                      12

page

this requirement these provisions may have the effect of delaying deferring
or preventing someone from taking control of us even though a change of
control might involve a premium price for our shareholders or might otherwise
be in our shareholders best interests

   we are subject to certain tax risks  we have elected to be taxed as a reit
under the internal revenue code to qualify as a reit we must satisfy numerous
requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly
technical and complex internal revenue code provisions only limited judicial
or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the
determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative
interpretations or court decisions may apply to us potentially with
retroactive effect and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit we
may receive significant nonqualifying income or acquire nonqualifying assets
which as a result may cause us to approach the income and assets test limits
imposed by the internal revenue code there is a risk that we may not satisfy
these tests if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be
subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we may
also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years
following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net
earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of
the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will
continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income
and property

   the ability of our shareholders to control our policies and effect a change
of control of our company is limited which may not be in our shareholders
best interests  under the terms of our shareholder rights plan our board of
directors can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than 15
of the outstanding shares of our common stock unless our board of directors
approves the persons purchase after that person acquires more than 15 of our
outstanding common stock all other shareholders will have the right to
purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market
value purchases by other shareholders would substantially reduce the value and
influence of the shares of our common stock owned by the acquiring person our
board of directors however can prevent the shareholder rights plan from
operating in this manner this gives our board of directors significant
discretion to approve or disapprove a persons efforts to acquire a large
interest in us

liquidity and capital resources

   liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations
either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of
additional funds through working capital management both the coordination of
asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are
important to the maintenance of liquidity united dominions primary source of
liquidity is its cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates
occupancy levels and operating expenses related to its portfolio of apartment
homes united dominion routinely uses its unsecured bank credit facility to
temporarily fund certain investing and financing activities prior to arranging
for longerterm financing during the past several years proceeds from the
sales of real estate have been used for both investing and financing activities

   united dominion expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements
generally through its net cash provided by operations and borrowings under
credit arrangements the company expects to meet certain longterm liquidity
requirements such as scheduled debt maturities the repayment of financing on
development activities and potential property acquisitions through longterm
secured and unsecured borrowings the disposition of properties and the
issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities of the company the
company believes that its net cash provided by operations will continue to be
adequate to meet both operating requirements and the payment of dividends by
the company in accordance with reit requirements in both the short and
longterm the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations of
certain properties are expected to be funded from property operations

   united dominion filed a shelf registration statement in december 1999
providing for the issuance of up to 700 million in common shares preferred
shares and debt securities to facilitate future financing activities in the
public capital markets in march 2000 united dominion utilized this shelf
registration statement to sell 100 million of senior unsecured notes due march
2003 at an interest rate of 8625 in december 2001 united dominion completed
an offering to the public of 41 million shares of common stock at a price of
1440 per share as of december 31 2001 541 million of equity and debt
securities remain available for use under the shelf registration although
access to capital markets is dependent on market conditions at the time of
issuance subsequent to december 31 2001 the underwriters who sold the
companys stock in december 2001 exercised their overallotment option for
166800 shares of common stock at a price of 1440 per share

   in september 2001 moodys investors service lowered its rating on the
securities of the company to baa3 from baa2 placing its rating on par with
that of standard  poors which had lowered its rating in 2000 this revision
did not trigger a material increase in the borrowing rate under the companys
375 million threeyear unsecured revolving bank credit facility or the
companys secured revolving fannie mae credit facilities see discussion under
credit facilities and united dominions debt rating remains investment
grade management does not anticipate that this revision will prevent the
company from accessing the public or private markets for either unsecured or
secured financing

future capital needs

   future development expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through
joint ventures or with proceeds from the sale of property and to a lesser
extent cash flows provided by operating activities acquisition activity in
strategic markets is expected to be largely financed by the reinvestment of
proceeds from the sale of property in nonstrategic markets

   during 2002 united dominion has approximately 1086 million of maturing
debt which the company anticipates repaying using proceeds from mortgage
refinancing activity or borrowings under unsecured or secured credit facilities

critical accounting policies

  capital expenditures

   united dominion capitalizes those expenditures related to acquiring new
assets materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially
extending the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to

expenditures for all of united dominions communities excluding development and
commercial properties these capital improvements included turnover related
expenditures for floor coverings and appliances other recurring capital
expenditures such as hvac equipment roofs landscaping siding parking lots
and other nonrevenue enhancing capital expenditures which aggregated 315
million or 418 per home in addition revenue enhancing capital expenditures
including water submetering gating and access systems the addition of
microwaves washerdryers interior upgrades and new business and fitness
centers totaled 216 million or 286 per home for the year ended december 31

   total capital improvements increased 116 million or 183 per home in 2001
compared to the same period in 2000 united dominion will continue to
selectively add revenue enhancing improvements that the company believes will
provide a return on investment substantially in excess of united dominions
cost of capital capital expenditures during 2002 are currently expected to be
at approximately the same level as those experienced in 2001

  revenue recognition

   united dominions apartment homes are leased under operating leases with
terms generally of one year or less the companys revenue recognition policy
approximates a straightline rent policy however united dominions revenue
recognition policy results in slightly lower revenues in periods of increasing
concessions and slightly higher revenues during periods of decreasing
concessions rental concessions are recognized when incurred rather than using
the straightline rent methodology during 2001 2000 and 1999 the company has
experienced increased rental concessions

  derivatives and hedging activities

   united dominion uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course
of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as of
december 31 2001 united dominion had 16 interest rate swap

                                      24

page

agreements with a notional value aggregating 282 million that are used to fix
the interest rate on a portion of the companys variable rate debt these
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements while we intend to continue to meet the
conditions for hedge accounting if a particular interest rate swap does not
qualify as highly effective the change in the fair value of the derivatives
used as hedges would be reflected in earnings

   interest rate swaps where the company effectively makes fixed rate payments
and receives variable rate payments to eliminate its variable rate exposure
are entered into to manage the interest rate risk in the companys existing
balance sheet mix these instruments are valued using the market standard
methodology of netting the discounted future variable cash receipts and the
discounted expected fixed cash payments the variable cash flow streams are
based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market
interest rate curves we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair
values or developing the underlying assumptions the values of these
derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as
market conditions change information about the fair values notional amounts
and contractual terms of the companys interest rate swaps can be found in note
7 to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled interest
rate risk that follows

   potential losses are limited to counterparty risk in situations where united
dominion is owed money that is when united dominion holds contracts with
positive fair values the company does not expect any losses from
counterparties failing to meet their obligations as the counterparties are
highly rated credit quality us financial institutions and management believes
that the likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty
nonperformance is remote at december 31 2001 the company had unrealized
losses totaling 149 million on derivative transactions which if terminated
would require a cash outlay united dominion presently has no intention to
terminate these contracts there are no credit concerns related to the
companys obligations and it expects to meet those obligations without default
see note 7financial instruments

   the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by
operating activities and net cash used in investing and financing activities
which are presented in united dominions consolidated statements of cash flows

operating activities

   for the year ended december 31 2001 united dominions cash flow from
operating activities was 2244 million compared to 2242 million for 2000
during 2001 cash flow from operating activities resulted primarily from a
change in the level of operating assets as a result of collections on escrow
accounts and joint venture receivables offset by a decline in revenues
generated from a smaller portfolio of assets

investing activities

   for the year ended december 31 2001 net cash used in investing activities
was 641 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of
587 million for 2000 changes in the level of investing activities from
period to period reflects united dominions strategy as it relates to its
acquisition capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well
as the impact of the capital market environment on these activities

real estate under development

   development activity is focused in core markets that have strong operations
managers in place for the year ended december 31 2001 united dominion
invested approximately 536 million in real estate projects down 308
million from its 2000 level of 844 million

company expects to pay prepayment penalties of approximately 23 million the
company estimates based upon certain assumptions as to the timing of the
refinancings and underlying interest rates that the positive net present value
of the refinancings will range from approximately 17 million to 20 million

   also in december 2001 united dominion completed an offering to the public
of 41 million shares of common stock at a price of 1440 per share the
proceeds were used to purchase apartment communities

   for the year ended december 31 2001 the company repaid 1073 million of
secured debt and 213 million of unsecured debt assumed 182 million of
secured debt in connection with the acquisition of properties and was relieved
of 283 million of secured debt in connection with the disposition of
properties

credit facilities

   united dominion has four secured revolving credit facilities with the
federal national mortgage association the fnma credit facilities with an
aggregate commitment of 860 million as of december 31 2001 4227 million
was outstanding under the fnma credit facilities leaving 4373 million of
unused capacity the fnma credit facilities are for an initial term of five or
ten years bear interest at a floating rate and can be extended for an
additional five years at united dominions discretion see note 4secured
debt

   united dominion has a 375 million threeyear unsecured revolving credit
facility the bank credit facility that matures august 2003 as of december
31 2001 2302 million was outstanding under the bank credit facility leaving
1448 million of unused capacity under the bank credit facility the company
may borrow at a rate of libor plus 110 basis points for liborbased borrowings
and pays a facility fee which is equal to 025 of the commitment see note
5unsecured debt

   the fnma credit facilities and the bank credit facility are subject to
customary financial covenants and limitations

derivative instruments

   as part of united dominions overall interest rate risk management strategy
the company uses derivatives as a means to fix the interest rates of variable
rate debt obligations or to hedge anticipated financing transactions the
companys derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management
include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of
specific financial instruments of united dominion the company believes that it
has appropriately controlled its interest rate risk through the use of its
derivative instruments due to the decline in interest rates in 2001 the fair
value of the companys derivative instruments has declined from an unfavorable
value position of 38 million at december 31 2000 to an unfavorable value
position of 149 million at december 31 2001 see note 7financial
instruments

interest rate risk

   united dominion is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable
rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced united dominion
does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real
estate assets united dominions interest rate sensitivity position is managed
by the companys finance department interest rate sensitivity is the
relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of
market rate sensitive assets and liabilities united dominions earnings are
affected as changes in shortterm interest rates impact its cost of variable
rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt a large portion of united dominions
market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from variable rate
borrowings outstanding under the unhedged portion of its fnma credit facilities
and its bank credit facility which totaled 4057 million and 752 million
respectively at december 31 2001 the impact on united dominions financial
statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2001 was not
material as permitted by the terms of the companys fnma credit facilities
management intends to convert a significant portion of those borrowings from
variable rates to fixed rates in 2002

   at december 31 2001 the notional value of united dominions derivative
products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was 282 million
representing interest rate swaps under which united dominion pays a fixed rate
of interest and receives a variable rate these agreements effectively fix 282
million of united dominions variable rate notes payable to a weighted average
fixed rate of 720 at december 31 2001 the fair market value of the
interest rate swaps in an unfavorable value position to united dominion was
149 million if interest rates were 100 basis points more or less at december
31 2001 the fair market value of the interest rate swaps would have increased
or decreased approximately 49 million and 50 million respectively

   if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points
more in 2002 than they did during 2001 united dominions interest expense
after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements would
increase and income before taxes would decrease by 52 million
comparatively if market interest rates for variable rate debt had averaged 100
basis points more in 2001 than in 2000 united dominions interest expense
after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements would have
increased and income before taxes would have decreased by 38 million if
market rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31
2001 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from 132 billion
to 128 billion if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis
points lower at december 31 2001 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have
increased from 132 billion to 138 billion

   these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical
interest rates on united dominions borrowing cost and interest rate swap
agreements these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of
overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment further in
the event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions
to further mitigate its exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty
of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the
sensitivity analysis assumes no change in united dominions financial structure

results of operations

  net income available to common shareholders
  2001vs2000

   net income available to common shareholders was 271 million 27 per
share for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 427 million 41 per
share for 2000 representing a decrease of 156 million 14 per share
excluding nonrecurring charges see discussion that follows under
restructuring charges and impairment loss on real estate and investments
and extraordinary items net income available to common shareholders was 415
million 41 per share for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 455
million 44 per share for 2000 representing a decrease of 40 million
04 per share excluding nonrecurring charges and extraordinary items the
decrease for the period was primarily due to the overall decrease in the
companys portfolio of assets that generated rental income of 6186 million
representing a decrease of

                                      29

80 million from 2000 in addition the company recognized lower gains on the
sale of investments during 2001 and incurred the writeoff of unamortized
original issuance costs associated with the companys 925 series a cumulative
redeemable preferred shares during the second quarter of 2001 this decrease
was moderated in part by a decrease in rental expenses of 42 million to
2462 million and lower interest costs of 1444 million during 2001 compared
to 1560 million in 2000

  2000vs1999

   net income available to common shareholders was 427 million 41 per
share for the year ended december 31 2000 compared to 559 million 54 per
share for 1999 representing a decrease of 132 million 13 per share the
decrease was primarily due to the following factors i property operating
income growth generated from the performance of the portfolio during 2000 was
offset by the decrease in the size of the portfolio due to the disposition
program ii united dominion recognized 315 million 31 per share of
gains on the sales of investments in 2000 compared to 380 million 37 per
share for the comparable period in 1999 and iii real estate depreciation
increased significantly in 2000 as a result of the recognition of catchup
depreciation expense on communities transferred from real estate held for
disposition to real estate held for investment during the second quarter of
2000 and to a lesser extent the impact of completed development communities
acquisitions and capital expenditures see note 2real estate owned

apartment community operations

   united dominions net income is primarily generated from the operations of
its apartment communities the following table summarizes the operating

   the decrease in property operating income provided by the companys
apartment community operations is due to the disposition of 7724 apartment
homes during 2000 and 2001 as a result of these dispositions the weighted
average number of apartment homes declined 47 from 2000 to 2001

  2001vs2000
  same communities

   united dominions same communities those communities acquired developed or
stabilized prior to january 1 2000 and held on january 1 2001 which consisted
of 72997 weighted average apartment homes provided 95 of the companys
property operating income for the year ended december 31 2001

   in 2001 property operating income for the same communities increased 23
or 85 million compared to the same period in 2000 the growth in property
operating income resulted from a 175 million or 31 increase in property
rental income over the same period in the prior year the increase was driven
by a 229 million or 39 increase in rental rates the increased rental rates
were partially offset by higher concessions and an increase in bad debt
expense physical occupancy decreased 02 to 940 in 2001 compared to 2000

                                      30

page

   for 2001 property operating expenses at these same communities increased
90 million or 44 the increase in property operating expenses resulted
primarily from a 33 million or 106 increase in utility costs experienced by
the company as a result of the increase in prices for natural gas and overall
increases in electricity costs in addition the company experienced a 30
million or 94 increase in repair and maintenance a 16 million or 31
increase in taxes and a 12 million or 21 increase in personnel costs

   as a result of the percentage changes in property rental income and property
operating expenses the operating margin property operating income divided by
property rental income decreased 05 to 632

  nonmature communities

   the remaining 5 of united dominions property operating income during 2001
was generated from its nonmature communities those communities acquired or
developed during 2000 and 2001 united dominions development communities
which included 2022 apartment homes constructed since january 1 2000
provided an additional 95 million of property operating income for the year
ended december 31 2001 in addition the six communities with 1571 apartment
homes acquired by united dominion during 2000 and 2001 provided an additional
38 million of property operating income during 2001

  2000vs1999
  same communities

   united dominions same communities those communities acquired developed or
stabilized prior to january 1 1999 and held on january 1 2000 which consisted
of 76267 weighted average apartment homes provided 94 of its property
operating income for the year ended december 31 2000

   in 2000 property operating income for the same communities increased 42
or 152 million compared to 1999 the growth in property operating income
resulted from a 268 million or 48 increase in property rental income which
was driven by a 171 million or 29 increase in rental rates coupled with a
58 million or 12 increase in physical occupancy the increase in rental
rates and occupancy was partially offset by higher concessions and bad debt
expense

   for 2000 property operating expenses at these same communities increased
116 million or 56 the increase in property operating expenses was due to
i a 26 million or 53 increase in real estate taxes related to the 14
billion of real estate acquired in 1998 which had undergone reassessment ii
a 41 million or 763 increase in property insurance costs attributable to a
combination of the companys loss history plus overall increases in market
rates iii a 31 million or 53 increase in personnel costs due to higher
salaries and benefit costs and iv a 19 million or 61 increase in
utilities expense these increases were offset by a 13 million or 37
decrease in repair and maintenance expense

   as a result of the increase in property rental income and increase in
property operating expenses the operating margin decreased 04 to 631

  nonmature communities

   the remaining 6 of united dominions property operating income during 2000
was generated from its nonmature communities those communities acquired or
developed during 1999 and 2000 united dominions development communities
which included 2470 apartment homes constructed since january 1 1999
provided an additional 123 million of property operating income for the year
ended december 31 2000 in addition the six communities with 1497 apartment
homes acquired by united dominion during 1999 and 2000 provided an additional
76 million of property operating income during 2000

real estate depreciation

   during the year ended december 31 2001 real estate depreciation decreased
11 million or 08 compared to 2000 the decrease in depreciation expense is
attributable to the overall decrease in the weighted average number of
apartment homes partially offset by the impact of completed development
communities acquisitions and capital expenditures

   during the year ended december 31 2000 real estate depreciation increased
313 million or 257 over 1999 this increase was primarily attributable to
i the recapture of approximately 10 million in depreciation expense on
communities transferred from real estate held for disposition to real estate
held for investment during the second quarter of 2000 and approximately 5
million of additional depreciation expense recognized on these assets during
2000 after they were reclassified into real estate held for investment ii
over 150 million in development completions in late 1999 and 2000 and iii
the effect of approximately 200 million in acquisitions and capital
improvements in 1999 and 2000 see note 2real estate owned

interest expense

   during 2001 interest expense decreased 117 million from the corresponding
amount in 2000 primarily due to decreasing interest rates and to a lesser
extent the overall decrease in the weighted average level of debt outstanding
for the year ended december 31 2001 the weighted average amount of debt
outstanding decreased 29 or 602 million from 2000 levels and the weighted
average interest rate decreased from 76 in 2000 to 71 in 2001 the weighted
average amount of debt employed during 2001 is lower as a portion of
disposition proceeds was used to repay outstanding debt the decrease in the
average interest rate during 2001 reflects the ability of the company to take
advantage of declining interest rates through refinancing and the utilization
of variable rate debt

   during 2000 interest expense increased 23 million over 1999 as the
weighted average amount of debt outstanding decreased 60 or 1247 million
from 1999 levels 21 billion in 2000 versus 22 billion in 1999 and the
weighted average interest rate increased from 74 in 1999 to 76 in 2000 the
weighted average amount of debt employed during 2000 was lower as disposition
proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt the increase in the average
interest rate during 2000 reflects the reliance on shortterm bank borrowings
that had higher interest rates when compared to the prior year for 2001 2000
and 1999 total interest capitalized was 29 million 36 million and 52
million respectively

restructuring charge

   during the quarter ended march 31 2001 united dominion undertook a
comprehensive review of the organizational structure of the company and its
operations subsequent to the appointment of a new senior management team and
ceo as a result the company recorded 45 million of expense related to the
termination of approximately 10 of united dominions workforce ultimately
approximately 230 fulltime equivalent positions in operations and at the
corporate headquarters these reductions will impact both personnel and general
and administrative expenses as of december 31 2001 all of the accrued charge
has been paid in addition united dominion recognized expense in the aggregate
of 09 million related to relocation costs associated with the new executive
offices in denver and other miscellaneous costs all charges came under
consideration subsequent to the appointment of the companys new ceo in
february 2001 and were approved by management and the board of directors in
march 2001 see note 9restructuring charges

impairment loss on real estate and investments

   in connection with the evaluation of the companys real estate assets and
operations during the first quarter of 2001 senior management determined that
it was in the companys best interest to dispose of a majority of its

                                      32

undeveloped tracts of land at an accelerated pace and redeploy the proceeds
elsewhere this represented a change from prior management in the holding
period of these assets and their respective values prior management had
purchased these tracts of land in 1999 and 2000 with the intent to build
apartment communities on them in order to accelerate the disposition of these
undeveloped land sites the company recorded an aggregate 28 million
impairment loss during the first quarter for the writedown of seven
undeveloped sites in selected markets the 28 million charge represents the
discount necessary to dispose of these assets in a short time frame coupled
with decreases in market value in 2001 for these properties see note 2real
estate owned in addition the company recognized a 04 million charge for
the writedown of united dominions investment in an online apartment leasing
company

   during the fourth quarter of 2001 realeum inc a technology venture
through which the company and two other multifamily reit entities have been
codeveloping a webbased property management system successfully completed a
secondary equity offering in which it raised approximately 15 million of new
capital in exchange for a 456 ownership stake the additional capital
provides realeum more flexibility as it rolls the product out for beta testing
and continues its marketing and system enhancement processes as a result of
the equity offering the market value of the companys ownership stake was
established at approximately 13 million although management believes the
potential revenue enhancements and cost efficiencies to be derived from an
implementation of the system would enable united dominion to recover its full
investment in realeum a more conservative accounting treatment that requires a
writedown of this investment to market value is appropriate as a result the
companys 35 million aggregate investment was adjusted to 13 million

general and administrative

   for the year ended december 31 2001 general and administrative expenses
increased 60 million or 382 over 2000 the increase was primarily due to an
increase in incentive compensation expense and adjustments to the companys
accruals for various employee benefits and state and local taxes

   during the year ended december 31 2000 general and administrative expenses
increased 19 million or 135 over 1999 reflecting a full years impact of
united dominions investment in professional staff technology and scaleable
accounting and information systems and the effect of additional franchise taxes
in tennessee as a result of a change in the state law regarding franchise taxes

gains on sales of investments

   for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 united dominion recognized
gains for financial reporting purposes of 247 million and 315 million
respectively changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period
reflect the changing level of united dominions divestiture activity from
period to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties
sold

inflation

   united dominion believes that the direct effects of inflation on the
companys operations have been inconsequential substantially all of the
companys leases are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes
united dominions risk from the adverse effects of inflation

income taxes

   united dominion is operated as and elects to be taxed as a real estate
investment trust reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended
the code generally a reit complies with the provisions of the code if it
distributes at least 90 95 prior to 2001 of its reit taxable income to its
shareholders and will not be subject to us federal income taxes if it
distributes at least 100 of its income accordingly no provision has been
made for federal income taxes however united dominion is subject to certain
state and local excise or franchise taxes for which provision has been made

   the differences between net income available to common shareholders for
financial reporting purposes and taxable income before dividend deductions
relate primarily to temporary differences principally real estate depreciation
and the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales the temporary
differences in depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis
of certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods of
depreciation and lives of the real estate assets

   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those
estimates

reclassifications

   certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior years
financial statements to conform with current year presentation

cash and cash equivalents

   cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased

investments in unconsolidated joint venture

   the company accounts for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using
the equity method when major business decisions require approval by the other
partners and the company does not have control of the assets investments are
recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income loss and
cash contributions and distributions united dominion eliminates intercompany
profits on sales of services that are provided to the venture differences
between the carrying value of investments and the underlying equity in net
assets of the investee are due to capitalized interest on the investment
balance and capitalized development and leasing costs that are recovered by the
company through fees during construction see note 3investment in
unconsolidated joint venture

real estate

   real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment losses

   expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to
expense as incurred expenditures for improvements renovations and
replacements related to the acquisition and improvement of real estate assets
are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if
the value of the existing asset will be materially enhanced or the life of the
related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life
expectancy

   united dominion recognizes impairment losses on longlived assets used in
operations when there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an
impairment in the value of an asset and the undiscounted future cash flows are
not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value if such indicators of
impairment are present an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of
the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value

   for longlived assets to be disposed of impairment losses are recognized
when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the
carrying value of the asset prior to 2000 properties were classified as real
estate held for disposition when management had committed to sell and was
actively marketing the property and united dominion expected to dispose of
these properties within the next twelve months beginning in 2000 properties
classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties
that are under contract for sale real estate held for disposition is carried
at the lower of cost net of accumulated depreciation or fair value less the
cost to dispose determined on an asset by asset basis expenditures for
ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are
charged to expense as incurred expenditures for improvements renovations and
replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at
cost depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition and
gains losses from initial and subsequent adjustments to the carrying value of
the assets if any are recorded as a separate component of income from
continuing operations

   depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets which is 35 years for buildings 10 to 35 years for
major improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture fixtures equipment and
other assets

   all development projects and related carrying costs are capitalized and
reported on the consolidated balance sheet as real estate under development
until such time as the development project is completed upon completion the
total cost of the building and associated land is transferred to real estate
held for investment and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives the cost of development projects includes interest real estate taxes
insurance and allocated development overhead during the construction period

                               december 31 2001


   interest real estate taxes and incremental labor and support costs for
personnel working directly on the development site are capitalized as part of
the real estate under development to the extent that such charges do not cause
the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net realizable value during
2001 2000 and 1999 total interest capitalized was 29 million 36 million
and 52 million respectively

revenue recognition

   united dominions apartment homes are leased under operating leases with
terms generally of one year or less rental income is recognized after it is
earned and collectibility is reasonably assured

restricted cash

   restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate
taxes insurance and replacement reserves and security deposits

deferred financing costs

   deferred financing costs include fees and other external costs incurred to
obtain debt financings and are generally amortized on a straightline basis
which approximates the effective interest method over a period not to exceed
the term of the related debt unamortized financing costs are writtenoff when
debt is retired before its maturity date during 2001 2000 and 1999
amortization expense was 36 million 50 million and 40 million
respectively

advertising costs

   all costs are expensed as incurred during 2001 2000 and 1999 total
advertising expense was 96 million 93 million and 97 million
respectively

interest rate swap agreements

   statements of financial accounting standards no 133 and 138 accounting
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities became effective on
january 1 2001 the accounting standards require companies to carry all
derivative instruments including certain embedded derivatives in the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value the accounting for changes in the
fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated
and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging
relationship for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify
as hedging instruments a company must designate the hedging instrument based
on the exposure being hedged as either a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or
a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation at december 31 2001 all
of the companys derivative financial instruments are interest rate swap
agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges of debt with variable
interest rate features and are qualifying hedges for financial reporting
purposes for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported
as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings
during the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of
the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged
item if any is recognized in current earnings during the period of change
the adoption of statements 133 and 138 on january 1 2001 resulted in a
cumulative effect of an accounting change of a 38 million loss all of which
was recorded directly to other comprehensive income

   as part of united dominions overall interest rate risk management strategy
the company uses derivative financial instruments as a means to artificially
fix variable rate debt or to hedge anticipated financing transactions the
companys derivative transactions used for interest rate risk management
include various interest rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of
specific financial instruments of united dominion because of the close
correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying cash flow
exposure being hedged fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments
are generally offset by changes in the cash flow of the underlying exposures
as a result united dominion believes that it has appropriately controlled the
risk so that derivatives used for interest rate risk management will not have a
material unintended effect on consolidated earnings the company does not enter
into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

   the fair value of the companys derivative instruments is reported on
balance sheet at their current fair value estimated fair values for interest
rate swaps rely on prevailing market interest rates these fair value amounts
should not be viewed in isolation but rather in relation to the values of the
underlying hedged transactions and investments and to the overall reduction in
exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates each interest rate swap
agreement is designated with all or a portion of the principal balance and term
of a specific debt obligation the interest rate swaps involve the periodic
exchange of payments over the life of the related agreements amounts received
or paid on the interest rate swaps are recorded on an accrual basis as an
adjustment to the related interest expense of the outstanding debt based on the
accrual method of accounting the related amounts payable to and receivable
from counterparties are included in other liabilities and other assets
respectively

   prior to the adoption of statements 133 and 138 on january 1 2001 united
dominion also used interest rate swap contracts for hedging purposes for
interest rate swaps the net amounts paid or received and net amounts accrued
through the end of the accounting period were included in interest expense the
fair value of the interest rate swap contracts were not recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet and unrealized gains or losses were not recognized
in the consolidated statements of operations gains and losses on any contracts
terminated early were deferred and amortized to income over the remaining
average life of the terminated contract

comprehensive income

   comprehensive income which is defined as all changes in equity during each
period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to
shareholders is displayed in the accompanying statements of shareholders
equity other comprehensive income consists of gains or losses from derivative
financial instruments

earnings per share

   basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year diluted earnings per
common share is computed based upon common shares outstanding plus the effect
of dilutive stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents the dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock method
based on united dominions average stock price

   the effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units and
convertible preferred stock is not dilutive and is therefore not included as a
dilutive security in the earnings per share computation the weighted average
effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units for the years ended
december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 was 7281835 shares 7489435 shares and
8180409 shares respectively the weighted average effect of the conversion
of the convertible preferred stock for the years ended december 31 2001 2000
and 1999 was 12307692 shares

impact of recently issued accounting standards

   in august 2001 the fasb issued statement 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 the statement
supercedes statement 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets
and for longlived assets to be disposed of sfas no 121 and accounting
principles board opinion no 30 reporting the results of
operationsreporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and
extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions
apb 30 for segments of a business to be disposed of sfas no 144 retains
the requirements of sfas no 121 relating to the recognition and measurement of
an impairment loss and resolves certain implementation issues resulting from
sfas no 121 the company does not anticipate that sfas no 144 will materially
change the way it accounts for longlived assets this statement is effective
for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 in february 2002 the fasb
rescinded statement 4 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt
sfas no 4 the rescission of sfas no 4 will be applied in accordance with
the guidance of the fasb but once applied united dominion will be required to
reclassify prior period items that do not meet the extraordinary classification
criteria in apb 30 the company from time to time incurs such charges and is
currently assessing the impact that these statements will have on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of united dominion

   the management of united dominion periodically reviews its divestiture
program which is designed to better position the company for achieving more
consistent earnings growth and increasing shareholder value over the longterm
the factors considered in these reviews include the age quality and projected
operating income of communities that might be sold the expected market value
for the communities the estimated timing for completion of sales and the pro
forma effect of sales upon united dominions earnings and financial position
during the first quarter of 2001 management performed an analysis of the
carrying value of all undeveloped land parcels in connection with the companys
plans to accelerate the disposition of these sites as a result an aggregate
28 million impairment loss was recognized on seven undeveloped sites in
selected markets an impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book
value of the assets being greater than the estimated fair market value less the
cost of disposal

   during the second quarter of 2000 management transferred approximately 197
million of assets from real estate held for disposition to real estate held for
investment and as a result approximately 10 million in depreciation expense
was recognized on the communities transferred in order to reflect depreciation
on these properties while they were classified in real estate held for
disposition furthermore approximately 5 million of additional depreciation
expense was recognized on these assets during 2000 subsequent to their transfer
to real estate held for investment depreciation expense in 2000 was further
inflated by the impact of over 150 million in development completions in late
1999 and 2000 and approximately 200 million in acquisitions and capital
improvements in 1999 and 2000

   for the year ended december 31 1999 united dominion recognized 183
million in impairment losses on its real estate owned through the review and
analysis of communities targeted for strategic disposition an aggregate 148
million impairment loss was recognized on assets held for disposition an
impairment loss was indicated as a result of the net book value of the assets
held for disposition being greater than the estimated fair market value less
the cost of disposal in addition united dominion recorded a 35 million
impairment loss on three communities acquired in the asr merger in 1998 which
were classified in real estate held for investment an impairment loss was
indicated as the sum of the estimated future cash flows from the assets were
deemed to be less than the carrying amounts

item 1   business


general
united dominion realty trust inc united dominion a virginia corporation
is a selfadministered equity real estate investment trust that owns acquires
renovates develops and manages middle market apartment communities nationwide

formed in 1972 united dominion is headquartered in richmond virginia with
regional offices in richmond dallas and atlanta the regional offices are
responsible for the operation and management of the companys 277 apartment
communities in their respective geographic regions united dominion which owns
over 77000 apartment homes had approximately 2400 employees as of january 31
2001

the company operates as a real estate investment trust under the applicable
provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended  to qualify the
company must meet certain tests which among other things require that its
assets consist primarily of real estate its income be derived primarily from
real estate and at least 95 of its taxable income be distributed to its
preferred and common shareholders  because the company qualifies as a reit it
is generally not subject to federal income taxes

business
overview
with an objective to be a national company and one of the largest apartment
reits from 1996 through 1998 united dominion acquired other reits private
portfolios and individual communities growing its apartment portfolio from
34000 to over 87000 apartment homes by the end of 1998 following this
significant acquisition period the company has spent the last two years
building infrastructure to catch up with the rapid growth upgrading its
portfolio and focusing on operational issues the goals have been to strengthen
and better position the company to sustain aboveaverage net operating income
growth steadily increase cash flow per apartment home generate more
predictable earnings and strengthen the capital structure

in 2000 united dominion upgraded its portfolio increased its financial
flexibility and refined its strategy during the year the company sold 215
million of noncore properties that included 26 communities with 5835 apartment
homes these divestitures were designed to increase the longterm profitability
of the portfolio the properties sold included slower growing communities in
several of the companys core markets as well as properties located within
markets which united dominion exited such as galveston texas montgomery
alabama and roanoke virginia the majority of the proceeds were used to reduce
debt strengthen the capital structure and increase financial flexibility a
lesser part of the proceeds were used to buyback equity securities both common
and preferred stock

changing demographics will have a significant impact on the apartment industry
over the next two decades the number of young people entering the workforce and
creating households will be significantly higher over the next 17 years as
compared to the number who entered the workforce over the past 12 years the
number of single people and single parent households continues to grow
significantly there is also higher growth in immigration than had been
expected each of the abovementioned population segments has a high propensity
to rent for the first time in more than a decade the growth in demand for
rental housing will exceed the growth in demand for owner occupied housing

customers
united dominion focuses on the broad middlemarket segment of the apartment
market which generally consists of rentersbynecessity  this group includes
young professionals blue collar families single parent households older
singles nonrelated parties and families renting while waiting to purchase a
home the company believes that this segment provides the highest profit
potential in terms of rent growth stability of occupancy desired level of
service and amenities and investment opportunities

recognizing the significant increase in younger renters over the next decade and
a half the company plans to target some of its incremental investments to
communities that will be attractive to young households these communities will
often be located close to where young people work shop and play

                                       3

markets
at the end of 2000 united dominion owned apartments in more than 60 msas but
derived 70 of its net operating income in 2000 from its 20 largest markets the
company has a geographically diverse portfolio both by region and market this
diversification increases investment opportunity and decreases the risk
associated with cyclical local real estate markets and economies thereby
increasing the stability and predictability of united dominions earnings   in
any given year the company will have some markets that are strong some that
are balanced and some that are weak

in 2000 new supply continued to come into the market as demand was slowing the
excess supply exerted pressure on occupancy and rents in some of the companys
key markets particularly raleigh charlotte and wilmington in north carolina
and columbus ohio offsetting this some of the companys markets experienced
aboveaverage noi growth for the year including richmond dallasfort worth
atlanta greensboro and baltimore the companys west coast markets including
its markets in california and the pacific northwest were exceptionally strong
throughout the year

communities
at december 31 2000 united dominions apartment portfolio included 277
communities having a total of 77219 completed apartment homes see item 2
properties  in addition united dominion had 1238 apartment homes under
development at two new communities and three additional phases to existing
owned communities

the overall quality of the portfolio has significantly improved since 1997 with
the disposition of more than 21000 apartment homes and the upgrading of most of
the core communities the upgrading of the portfolio provides several key
benefits related to portfolio profitability it reduces capital expenditures per
apartment and therefore increases cash flow it enables the company to attract
residents with higher levels of disposable income and these are customers that
are more likely to accept the transfer of expenses from the landlord to the
resident such as water and sewer costs and will generally want additional
services from the landlord that will generate additional revenue

during the past four years united dominions same community noi growth averaged
above 5 the company grew rental and other income and increased occupancy while
controlling operating expenses this is a direct result of the overall
improvement to the quality of the portfolio for 2001 the company expects same
community net operating income growth in a majority of its markets noi growth
is the companys primary earnings driver

new ceo
with the companys repositioning substantially complete united dominion began a
search for a new ceo in the fourth quarter this search culminated with the
hiring of thomas w toomey on february 13 2001 to replace john p mccann who
served in this role for more than 26 years mr toomey has begun a review of the
organizational structure and strategy of the company this review could result
in changes that may require the company to incur expenses for severance and
termination benefits additionally the review may result in a change of intent
with regard to anticipated holding periods of certain assets which could require
the write down of these assets

technology
primarily over the past two years united dominion has invested in technology to
improve business processes communications with constituencies and to become a
better marketer the company believes that technology can provide competitive
advantages in the future key technology initiatives over the past year have
included a redeveloped corporate web site an etraining initiative to take
training out of the classroom and directly to associates at their workstations
and the codevelopment of a webbased property management system

2000 accomplishments
   net operating income property operating income less property operating
   expenses from same communities those acquired developed or stabilized
   prior to january 1 1999 and held on january 1 2000 increased 41 in 2000
   compared to 1999

   completed four development projects aggregating 681 million with 992
   apartment homes in five different markets leaseups were ahead of projected
   absorption at two of these communities

prior to 1990 united dominion was the only major publicly held reit focusing
predominantly on apartment investments  since then a number of multifamily
reits have been formed the apartment sector of the real estate industry has
undergone modest but steady consolidation over the past decade some apartment
reits and privately owned portfolios may seek to be acquired by large well
capitalized reits that have superior access to the capital markets united
dominion has been a participant in this consolidation process completing the
following mergers

     on december 31 1996 united dominion completed the acquisition of
     southwest property trust inc southwest in a statutory merger the
     southwest merger  southwest was a publicly traded multifamily reit that
     owned 44 communities with 14320 apartment homes primarily located in
     texas the southwest merger provided the company with diversification
     beyond its traditional southeast and midatlantic markets expanding the
     company into the southwestern markets

     on march 27 1998 united dominion completed the acquisition of asr
     investments corporation asr in a statutory merger the asr merger
     asr was a publicly traded multifamily reit that owned 39 communities with
     7550 apartment homes located in arizona texas new mexico and the state
     of washington the asr merger furthered the companys investment in
     southwestern markets provided an initial presence in the pacific
     northwest and added communities in houston and phoenix

     on december 7 1998 united dominion completed the acquisition of american
     apartment communities ii inc aac in a statutory merger  the aac
     merger  in connection with the acquisition of aac the company acquired
     53 communities with 14001 apartment homes located primarily in california
     the pacific northwest the midwest and florida the aac merger allowed
     united dominion to enter into new major markets many of which are strong
     growth markets through the aac merger the company entered portland san
     francisco sacramento san jose monterey los angeles denver
     indianapolis and detroit  in addition aac added communities to the
     companys portfolios in columbus tampa south florida and seattle

developmentupgrading activity
during 2000 united dominion continued to reposition properties in targeted
markets where there was a perceived opportunity to add value and achieve greater
than inflationary increases in rents over the long term over the past three
years the company has shifted capital into development that could provide
returns on investment property operating income less property operating
expenses and a capital expenditure allowance divided by the average investment
in excess of 95 and away from lower yielding acquisitions in 2000 united
dominion spent over 90 million on direct development projects this included
681 million to finish 992 apartment homes in one new community and three
second phases and 268 million to start 1238 apartment homes in two new
communities and three second phases

during 2000 united dominion completed the formation of a development joint
venture with an institutional partner  the joint venture allows the company to
reduce its development capital commitment and generate fee income as the
developer general contractor and project manager  united dominion expects to
further reduce the capital committed to development in 2001 and to do most new
development in joint ventures where the company can generate fee income and
increased participation based on performance

in 2001 the company will reduce its development activity in suburban low
barrier to entry submarkets and sell off several suburban development sites
in determining whether to develop in a certain market united dominion analyzes
demographic and market data such as income levels occupancy rates household
formation employment growth and supply demand ratios  united dominion will
spend less on development in 2001 than it spent in either 1999 or 2000

same communities
united dominions primary earnings driver is same apartment community
operations  during 2000 the companys same communities provided 94 of the
companys property operating income  rental growth was 42 and resulted
primarily from a 29 increase in rental rates and a 12 increase in physical
occupancy operating expenses also grew by 42 much of which resulted from a
634 increase in property insurance costs and a 53 increase in real estate
taxes  average physical occupancy rental rates and operating margins at united
dominions same communities during the past three years as set forth below

while the company continues to add features to its apartment communities united
dominion completed most of its same community upgrade program in 1999 as part
of its plan to improve the quality of the portfolio   during 2000 the
companys investment in revenue enhancing and recurring capital expenditures
significantly decreased as a result of the portfolio upgrade recurring and
overall capital expenditures declined in 2000 for the mature apartments
recurring capital expenditures were 311 versus 386 per mature apartment in
1999 the company in 2000 also spent 203 per mature apartment on revenue
enhancing capital expenditures mostly on communities acquired in 1998 where
the upgrade work was not completed in 1999 in 1999 the company spent 253 per
mature apartment on revenue enhancing capital expenditures revenue enhancing
improvements include submetering of water and sewer to residents gating and
fencing of communities installing intrusion alarms adding business and fitness
centers and constructing carports garages and self storage units

divestiture activity
during the past three years united dominion has sold more than 21000 of its
slower growing noncore apartment homes while exiting some markets these sales
were done to increase the performance of the portfolio they allowed united
dominion to exit slower growing markets and increase the quality of the
portfolio including reducing the average age of the portfolio  proceeds from
the disposition program were used to strengthen the companys capitalization
structure by paying down debt as well as to fund new development projects and
to selectively repurchase shares of united dominions preferred and common
stock

at december 31 2000 there was one community with 132 apartment homes three
commercial properties and one parcel of land classified as real estate held for
disposition the company regularly monitors and adjusts its assets in order to
increase portfolio profitability proceeds from the 2001 sales currently
planned to be lower than 2000 are expected to be used to reduce debt
repurchase common and preferred stock fund development and acquire communities
through 1031 exchanges the companys divestitures in 2001 are currently
expected to be substantially nondilutive to earnings

financing activity
as part of united dominions plan to strengthen its capital structure in 2000
the company used a majority of its disposition proceeds to reduce debt the
company anticipates using a significant portion of its 2001 disposition proceeds
to reduce debt and further increase its financial flexibility

during 2000 united dominions major financing activities consisted of i
issuing 100 million of unsecured notes with an interest rate of 8625 ii
refinancing 467 million of taxexempt notes at a blended rate of 632 iii
closing on a 60 million revolving credit facility with the federal national
mortgage association with an initial interest rate of 712 iv borrowing 100
million in the form of an unsecured term loan from a consortium of banks and
v repurchasing approximately 14 million of common shares and over 700000
shares of preferred stock

taxable reit subsidiary
in december 1999 the reit modernization act rma was signed into law the
rma contains several provisions that when effective in 2001 will allow reits
to compete more effectively in the real estate industry by allowing reits to
offer the same types of services as other competitors in the marketplace the
most important feature of the rma is the allowance for reits to create a
taxable reit subsidiary trs that can provide services to residents and
others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its
residents

under the prior law reits were not allowed to provide noncustomary or tenant
specific services to its residents such as concierge services beyond a de
minimus amount as the apartment industry has become a competitive customer
focused business these constraints inhibited reits from maintaining a
competitive edge in attracting and maintaining residents as such the rma has
several significant benefits for the reit industry reits will be allowed
through a trs to provide a wide range of increasingly important services that
residents have come to expect in addition the trs will allow reits to
generate new sources of income for reit shareholders

effective january 1 2001 a reit can own 100 of the stock of a trs however
the legislation contains a number of safeguards that would limit the size of a
trs to ensure that reits remain focused on their core business of owning and
operating real estate assets the rma provides another significant change to
the existing law the rma changes the minimum distribution requirement from 95
to 90 of the reits taxable income this will allow reits to retain a greater
level of capital that can be used to invest back into expenditures to maintain
the quality of their real estate assets as well as repay outstanding debt

united dominion will determine the best uses of the trs in order to be in a
position to take full advantage of the opportunities the new legislation has to
offer in 2001

competition
in most of united dominions markets the competition for new residents is
intense some competing communities offer features that united dominions
communities do not have some competing communities may use concessions or lower
rents to obtain competitive advantages  also some competing communities are
larger or newer than united dominions communities  the competitive position of
each community is different depending upon many factors including submarket
supply and demand

management believes that united dominion in general is well positioned in
terms of economic and other resources to compete effectively for residents and
investments

                                       7

united dominion believes it has certain competitive advantages that include

         a fully integrated organization with property management development
          acquisition redevelopment marketing and financing expertise

         geographic diversification with presence in more than 32 major markets
          across the country and

         local presence in many of its major markets which allows it to be a
          local operating expert

environmental regulations
to date compliance with federal state and local environmental protection
regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures earnings
or competitive position of united dominion  however over the past 15 years
the issue has been raised regarding the presence of asbestos and other hazardous
materials in existing real estate properties united dominion has a property
management plan for hazardous materials  as part of the plan phase i
environmental site investigation and reports have been completed for each
property owned  in addition all proposed acquisitions are inspected prior to
acquisition acquisitions through merger are inspected on a case by case basis
given historical information available the inspections are conducted by
qualified environmental consultants and the report issued is reviewed by united
dominion prior to the purchase or development of any property  nevertheless it
is possible that united dominions environmental assessments will not reveal all
environmental liabilities or that some material environmental liabilities exist
of which united dominion is unaware in some cases united dominion has
abandoned otherwise economically attractive acquisitions because the costs of
removal or control of hazardous materials have been prohibitive or united
dominion has been unwilling to accept the potential risks involved  united
dominion does not believe it will be required to engage in any largescale
abatement at any of its properties  management believes that through
professional environmental inspections and testing for asbestos lead paint and
other hazardous materials coupled with a conservative posture toward accepting
known risk united dominion can minimize its exposure to potential liability
associated with environmental hazards

recently enacted federal legislation requires owners and landlords of
residential housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents
or purchasers of the communities any known lead paint hazards and will impose
treble damages for failure to so notify  in addition lead based paint in any
of the communities may result in lead poisoning in children residing in that
community if chips or particles of such lead based paint are ingested and
united dominion may be held liable under state laws for any such injuries caused
by ingestion of lead based paint by children living at the communities

united dominion is unaware of any environmental hazards at any of its properties
which individually or in the aggregate may have a material adverse impact on its
operations or financial position  united dominion has not been notified by any
governmental authority and is not otherwise aware of any material non
compliance liability or claim relating to environmental liabilities in
connection with any of its properties  united dominion does not believe that
the cost of continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and
regulations will have a material adverse effect on the company or its financial
condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance however that
future environmental laws regulations or ordinances will not require additional
remediation of existing conditions that are not currently actionable  also if
more stringent requirements are imposed on united dominion in the future the
costs of compliance could have a material adverse effect on united dominion or
its financial condition  to the best of its knowledge united dominion is in
compliance with all applicable environmental rules and regulations

liquidity and capital resources
united dominions primary source of liquidity is its cash flow from operations
as determined by rental rates occupancy levels and operating expenses related
to its portfolio of apartment homes united dominion routinely uses its
unsecured bank credit facility to temporarily fund certain investing and
financing activities prior to arranging for longerterm financing during the
past several years proceeds from the sales of real estate have been used for
both investing and financing activities

united dominion regularly reviews its short and longterm liquidity requirements
and considers the adequacy of its cash flow from operations as well as other
liquidity sources to meet these requirements  united dominion believes that it
can fund its shortterm liquidity needs such as normal recurring operating
expenses debt service payments recurring capital expenditures and
distributions to common and preferred shareholders through cash provided by
operating activities and borrowings from the companys unsecured bank credit
facility as needed see discussion that follows under financing activities

to facilitate future financing activities in the public capital markets
management believes that it is prudent to maintain shelf registration statement
capacity  in this regard united dominion filed a shelf registration statement
in december 1999 providing for the issuance of up to 700 million in common
shares preferred shares and debt securities  in march 2000 united dominion
utilized this shelf registration statement to sell 100 million of senior
unsecured notes due march 2003 at an interest rate of 8625  the proceeds from
the offering were used to repay certain mortgage debt and repay revolving bank
debt

future capital needs
future development expenditures are expected to be funded through joint ventures
or with proceeds from the sale of property  acquisition activity is expected to
be primarily limited to the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of property
in order to defer large tax gains and reinvested in targeted markets and sub
markets

during 2001 united dominion has approximately 63 million of maturing debt
which the company anticipates repaying using proceeds from the sale of apartment
communities mortgage refinancing activity or borrowings under the companys
unsecured credit facility

the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating
and investing activities and net cash used in financing activities which are
presented in united dominions consolidated statements of cash flows

operating activities
for the year ended december 31 2000 united dominions cash flow from operating
activities was 2242 million compared to 1906 million for 1999 an increase
of 336 million the increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted
primarily from a change in the level of operating assets as a result of
collections on escrow accounts and property insurance receivables during 2000

investing activities
for the year ended december 31 2000 net cash provided by investing activities
was 1038 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of 340
million for 1999  changes in the level of investing activities from period to
period reflects united dominions strategy as it relates to its acquisition
capital expenditure development and disposition programs as well as the impact
of the capital market environment on these activities

real estate under development
during 2000 development activity was focused in core markets that have strong
operations managers in place   for the year ended december 31 2000 united
dominion invested approximately 801 million on real estate projects down
339 million from its 1999 level of 1140 million

disposition of investments
for the year ended december 31 2000 united dominion sold 26 communities with
5835 apartment homes one commercial property and a parcel of land for an
aggregate sales price of approximately 2145 million and recognized gains for
financial reporting purposes of 315 million   these sales allowed the company
to dispose of older noncore communities to exit certain markets that had
limited growth opportunities and to improve the average age of the apartment
portfolio  during 1999 united dominion sold 36 communities with 7443
apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of 2412 million which resulted
in gains for financial reporting purposes of 380 million

during 2001 united dominion plans to sell noncore communities at levels
somewhat below that of 2000  proceeds from the 2001 dispositions are currently
planned to be used to improve the companys financial flexibility and
opportunistically reinvest a portion of the proceeds in acquisitions and the
repurchase of equity securities

acquisitions
during the year ended december 31 2000 united dominion acquired one community
with 267 apartment homes at a total cost including closing costs of 148
million which included the assumption of debt and the use of tax free exchange
funds as the company further curtailed its acquisition activity from 1999 and
1998 levels

during 2001 in order to complete 1031 exchange requirements united dominion
expects to invest 25 to 30 of the companys disposition proceeds in targeted
markets and submarkets  these acquisitions will focus on communities where
there is the opportunity to add value by repositioning the property to be
attractive to the companys middlemarket customer

capital expenditures
united dominion capitalizes those expenditures related to acquiring new assets
materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending
the useful life of an existing asset expenditures necessary to maintain an
existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred

during 2000 392 million or 514 per home was spent on capital expenditures
for united dominions same communities those acquired or developed prior to
january 1 1999  these capital improvements included recurring capital
expenditures including floor coverings hvac equipment roofs appliances
landscaping siding parking lots and other nonrevenue enhancing capital
expenditures which aggregated 237 million or 311 per home  in addition
nonrecurring revenue enhancing capital expenditures including water sub
metering gating and access systems the addition of microwaves washerdryers
interior upgrades and new business and fitness centers totaled 155 million or
203 per home for the year ended december 31 2000 united dominion will
continue to selectively add revenueenhancing improvements which are budgeted to
provide a high return on investment  capital expenditures during 2001 are
currently expected to be at levels somewhat higher than those experienced in
2000

financing activities
net cash used in financing activities during 2000 was 3253 million compared to
1750 million for 1999 an increase of 1503 million during 2000 as part of
the plan to improve its balance sheet position united dominion used 77 of the
net proceeds from its disposition program to pay down secured and unsecured debt
and 14 to repurchase shares of common and preferred stock  the remaining 9 of
the net proceeds were used to complete an acquisition

during 2000 using the net proceeds from its disposition program united
dominion repurchased 647 million of certain of its higher rate outstanding
unsecured debt with a weighted average yield of 839  in addition the company
repaid 709 million of mortgage debt and 224 million of revolving bank debt

during the first quarter of 2000 united dominion issued 100 million of 8625
unsecured notes due 2003  net proceeds of 995 million were used to repay
outstanding bank debt  in addition united dominion completed the refinancing
of taxexempt notes aggregating 467 million at a blended rate of 632 and
with a final maturity of august 2008  in conjunction with this refinancing the
company removed the liens on 86 million of real estate which had previously
secured the taxexempt notes

in september 2000 united dominion closed on the first part of a 60 million
revolving credit facility the fnma credit facility with the federal national
mortgage association  the 383 million initially borrowed under the terms of
the fnma credit facility has an initial interest rate of 712 which is fixed
through april 1 2001 the fnma credit facility is for an initial term of five
years bears interest at a floating rate which can be fixed for periods of up to
270 days and can be extended for an additional five or ten years at united
dominions discretion  the proceeds from the fnma credit facility were used to
repay a 286 million remic financing that matured during the third quarter and
the remaining proceeds were used to repay revolving bank debt

in november 2000 united dominion borrowed 100 million in the form of an
unsecured term loan from a consortium of banks  the term loan will initially
mature in may 2003 but may be extended at the companys option for two
additional twelvemonth periods  proceeds from the term loan were used to
partially repay a 1409 million unsecured note payable that matured in the
fourth quarter of 2000 with the remaining balance repaid from borrowings under
united dominions existing unsecured credit facility  also during the fourth
quarter of 2000 a 239 million secured note payable matured and was repaid
using proceeds from additional borrowings under an existing revolving credit
facility with the federal national mortgage association and borrowings under the
companys unsecured credit facility

as of december 31 2000 approximately 145 million of united dominions
preferred shares have been repurchased under the 25 million preferred share
repurchase program   for the year ended december 31 2000 united dominion
repurchased 199440 series a preferred shares at an average price of 2322 per
share and 507191 series b preferred shares at an average price of 1946 per
share

                                       27
page

for the year ended december 31 2000 the company repurchased 1398659 common
shares at an average price of  1003 and repurchased 10097 operating
partnership units  as of december 31 2000 approximately seven million common
shares remained available for purchase under the common share repurchase
program   repurchases of shares will be made from time to time in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions  the timing volume and purchase
price will be at the discretion of the company

credit facilities
in june 2000 united dominion closed on a  375 million threeyear unsecured
revolving credit facility the credit facility with a consortium of banks
the credit facility which extends until august 2003 replaces two lines of
credit that allowed the company to borrow in aggregate up to 310 million  at
december 31 2000 2444 million was outstanding under the credit facility
leaving 1306 million available for use

under the credit facility the company may borrow at a rate of libor plus 100
basis points for liborbased borrowings  this rate is equal to the rate the
company was able to borrow under a 110 million line of credit arranged in 1999
that was replaced by the new expanded and longerterm credit facility  under
the credit facility the company pays a facility fee which is equal to 020 of
the commitment the credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants
and limitations

derivative instruments
as part of united dominions overall interest rate risk management strategy the
company uses offbalance sheet derivatives as a means to modify the interest
rate characteristics of onbalance sheet debt obligations or to hedge
anticipated financing transactions  the companys offbalance sheet derivative
transactions used for interest rate risk management include various interest
rate swaps with indices that relate to the pricing of specific financial
instruments of united dominion  the company believes that it has appropriately
controlled the risk so that derivatives used for interest rate risk management
will not have any material unintended effect on consolidated earnings
derivative contracts did not have a material impact on the results of operations
during 2000 see note 6  financial instruments

effective january 1 2001 united dominion will be required to adopt the
provisions of statements of financial accounting standards no 133 and 138
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all of the
companys derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions of the
statements see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies

market risk
united dominion is exposed to market risk principally from interest rate risk
associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be
refinanced  united dominion does not hold financial instruments for trading or
other speculative purposes but rather issues these financial instruments to
finance its portfolio of real estate assets united dominions interest rate
sensitivity position is managed by the companys finance department  interest
rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates
and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities  united
dominions earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates on its
variable rate debt and the refinancing of fixed rate debt a large portion of
united dominions market risk is exposure to shortterm interest rates from
variable rate borrowings outstanding under its credit facility which totaled
2444 million at december 31 2000 the impact on united dominions financial
statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during 2000 was not
material

at december 31 2000 the notional value of united dominions derivative
products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was 247 million of
interest rate swaps under which united dominion pays a fixed rate of interest
and receives a variable rate  these agreements effectively fix 247 million of
united dominions variable rate notes payable to a weighted average fixed rate
of 738  at december 31 2000 the fair market value of the interest rate
swaps in an unfavorable value position to united dominion was 38 million see
note 6  financial instruments  if interest rates were 100 basis points more
or less at december 31 2000 the fair market value of the interest rate swaps
would have increased or decreased approximately 59 million and 61 million
respectively

                                       28
page

if market interest rates for variable rate debt average 100 basis points more in
2001 than they did during 2000 united dominions interest expense after
considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements would increase
and income before taxes would decrease by 38 million  comparatively if
market interest rates for variable rate debt averaged 100 basis points more in
2000 than it did in 1999 united dominions interest expense after considering
the effects of its interest rate swap agreements would increase and income
before taxes would decrease by 40 million  if market rates for fixed rate
debt were 100 basis points higher at december 31 2000 the fair value of fixed
rate debt would have decreased from 139 billion to 133 billion  if market
interest rates for fixed rate debt were 100 basis points lower at december 31
2000 the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from 139 billion
to 145 billion

these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest
rates on united dominions borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall
economic activity that could exist in such an environment  further in the
event of a change of such magnitude management would likely take actions to
further mitigate its exposure to the change  however due to the uncertainty of
the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects the
sensitivity analysis assumes no change in united dominions financial structure

results of operations
2000vs1999
net income available to common shareholders was 427 million 41 per share
for the year ended december 31 2000 compared to 559 million 54 per share
for 1999 representing a decrease of 132 million 13 per share  the
decrease was primarily due to the following factors i property operating
income growth generated from the performance of the portfolio during 2000 was
offset by the decrease in the size of the portfolio due to the disposition
program ii united dominion recognized 315 million 31 per share of gains
on the sales of investments in 2000 compared to 380 million 37 per share
for the comparable period in 1999 and iii real estate depreciation increased
significantly in 2000 as a result of the recognition of catchup depreciation
expense on communities transferred from real estate held for disposition to real
estate held for investment during the second quarter of 2000 and to a lesser
extent the impact of completed development communities and capital expenditures
see note 2  real estate owned

1999vs1998
for 1999 net income available to common shareholders increased 72 million
with a corresponding increase of 05 for both basic and diluted earnings per
share compared to 1998  the increase per share was primarily attributable to
aggregate gains on the sales of investments of 380 million 37 per share
for the year ended december 31 1999 compared to 267 million 27 per share
in 1998  however the increases associated with the gain on sales of
investments were moderated in part due to the 193 million of impairment losses
recorded during 1999 united dominions nonmature communities with 31454
apartment homes at december 31 1999 provided a substantial portion of the
increase in united dominions operating income during 1999

the increase in property operating income provided by the same communities
development communities and acquisition communities since december 31 1999 was
partially offset by the loss of property operating income due to the disposition
of 13278 apartment homes during 1999 and 2000  as a result of united
dominions disposition program the weighted average number of apartment homes
declined 66 during 2000

2000vs1999
same communities
united dominions same communities those communities acquired developed or
stabilized prior to january 1 1999 and held on january 1 2000 which consisted
of 76267 weighted average apartment homes provided 94 of its property
operating income for the year ended december 31 2000

in 2000 property operating income for the same communities increased 41 or
141 million compared to 1999  the growth in property operating income
resulted from a 233 million or 42 increase in property rental income which
was driven by a  171 million or 29 increase in rental rates coupled with a
58 million or 12 increase in physical occupancy  the increase in rental
rates and occupancy was partially offset by higher concessions and bad debt
expense

for 2000 property operating expenses at these same communities increased 92
million or 42  the increase in property operating expenses was due to i a
26 million or 53 increase in real estate taxes related to the portion of the
14 billion of real estate acquired in 1998 that has undergone reassessment
ii a 45 million or 634 increase in property insurance costs attributable
to a combination of the companys loss history plus overall increases in market
rates  iii a 31 million or 53 increase in personnel costs due to higher
salaries and benefit costs and iv a 11 million or 65 increase in property
management as a result of added infrastructure costs in areas such as
information technology human resources and training  these increases were
offset by a 16 million or 60 decrease in utilities expense due to the
continued transfer of water and sewer costs to residents and a 14 million or
38 decrease in repair and maintenance expense as the company continues to
benefit from the upgrade program and centralized purchasing initiatives

as a result of the percentage changes in total property operating income
and total property operating expenses the operating margin property operating
income divided by property rental income declined 01 to 612

nonmature communities
the remaining 6 of united dominions property operating income during 2000 was
generated from its nonmature communities those communities acquired or
developed during 1999 and 2000 united dominions development communities which
included 2470 apartment homes constructed since january 1 1999 provided an
additional 123 million of property operating income for the year ended
december 31 2000 in addition the six communities with 1497 apartment homes
acquired by united dominion during 1999 and 2000 provided an additional 76
million of property operating income during 2000

1999vs1998
same communities
united dominions same communities those communities acquired developed or
stabilized prior to january 1 1998 and held on january 1 1999 which consisted
of 51316 weighted average apartment homes provided 60 of its property
operating income for the year ended december 31 1999

in 1999 property operating income increased 56 or 120 million compared to
1998  the growth in property operating income resulted primarily from a 111
million or 31 increase in property rental income reflecting an increase in
average monthly rental rates of 34 while physical occupancy remained constant
at 931  for 1999 property operating expenses at these same communities
decreased 06 or 827 thousand compared to 1998  utility expense decreased due
to the continued transfer of water and sewer costs to residents repair and
maintenance expense decreased as a result of the upgrade program and taking more
turnover work inhouse and property management expenses decreased due to better
economies of scale  however these decreases were offset by an increase in
personnel costs due to higher salaries and

                                       30
page

benefit costs an increase in real estate taxes the addition of monitored
alarms in more communities and higher technology costs

as a result of the increase in property rental income and the decrease in
property operating expenses the operating margin improved 15 to 613

nonmature communities
the remaining 40 of united dominions property operating income during 1999 was
generated from its nonmature communities those communities acquired or
developed during 1998 and 1999   united dominions nonmature apartment
portfolio consisted of i american apartment communities ii inc consisting
of 13728 homes net of sales which provided a first year return on investment
property rental income less property operating expenses divided by the average
capital investment in real estate of 91 on an average investment of 761
million and achieved an operating margin of 627 ii 13577 homes net of
sales acquired in 1998 which provided an 84 return on investment on an
average investment of 611 million with an operating margin of 578 iii five
communities with 1230 apartment homes acquired by united dominion during 1999
on an initial investment of 74 million that did not have a material impact on
1999 results of operation iv 12761 apartment homes sold for an aggregate
sales price of 398 million as part of united dominions strategic repositioning
since january 1 1998 and v 2404 homes developed at various times since
january 1 1998 which included the completion of six new communities and one
additional phase to an existing community during 1999

interest expense
during 2000 interest expense increased 23 million over the corresponding
amount in 1999 as the weighted average interest rate increased from 74 in 1999
to 76 in 2000 which more than offset the decrease of 1247 million in the
weighted average amount of debt outstanding  21 billion in 2000 versus 22
billion in 1999  the weighted average amount of debt employed during 2000 was
lower as disposition proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt the increase
in the average interest rate during 2000 reflects shortterm bank borrowings
that had higher interest rates when compared to the prior year  for 2000 1999
and 1998 total interest capitalized was 36 million 52 million and 34
million respectively

during 1999 interest expense increased 475 million over the corresponding
amount in 1998 as the weighted average amount of debt employed during 1999 was
higher than it was in 1998 21 billion in 1999 versus 15 billion in 1998
the increase in the weighted average amount of debt employed in 1999 was
primarily due to debt assumed during 1998 to fund united dominions investment
activities  the weighted average interest rate on this debt was 74 in both
1999 and 1998

real estate depreciation
during the year ended december 31 2000 real estate depreciation increased
313 million or 257 over 1999  this increase was primarily attributable to
the recognition of catchup depreciation expense on communities transferred from
real estate held for disposition to real estate held for investment during the
second quarter of 2000 and to a lesser extent the impact of completed
development communities see note 2  real estate owned and capital
expenditures

during the year ended december 31 1999 real estate depreciation increased
221 million or 222 over 1998  the increase was primarily due to the
recognition of a full year of depreciation on united dominions 1998 acquired
properties and to a lesser extent the recognition of depreciation on the
companys 1999 acquisitions

general and administrative
during the year ended december 31 2000 general and administrative expenses
increased 19 million or 135 over 1999 excluding a 27 million charge
recognized in the third quarter of 2000 related to the settlement of a class
action lawsuit concerning water usage billing in texas see note 10 
contingencies and a 10 million charge to recognize expenses under employment
agreements for certain executives of united dominion as a result of planned
organizational changes the 19 million increase was primarily due to a 08
million increase in franchise taxes in tennessee as a result of a change in the
state law

                                       31
page

regarding franchise taxes with the remaining increase due to recruiting and
tuition costs and consulting costs incurred throughout the strategic planning
process

during the year ended december 31 1999 general and administrative expenses
increased  37 million or 366 over 1998 primarily due to the expanded
operations of united dominion and its continued investment in professional
staff technology and scaleable accounting and information systems

impairment loss
united dominion did not recognize any impairment loss on its real estate
portfolio for the year ended december 31 2000

for the year ended december 31 1999 united dominion recognized 183 million
in impairment losses on its real estate portfolio  as a result of the review of
its real estate apartment portfolio 21 properties included in real estate held
for investment were moved to real estate held for disposition during the second
quarter  through the review and analysis of communities targeted for strategic
disposition an aggregate 71 million impairment loss was recognized on five
communities in the second quarter and an additional 112 million impairment
loss was recognized in the fourth quarter of 1999 related principally to
communities acquired in the asr merger in 1998

gains on sales of investments
for the years ended december 31 2000 and 1999 united dominion recognized gains
for financial reporting purposes of 315 million and 380 million
respectively  changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period
reflect the changing level of united dominions divestiture activity from period
to period as well as the extent of gains related to specific properties sold

distributions to preferred shareholders
distributions to preferred shareholders totaled 369 million for the year ended
december 31 2000 compared to 377 million for 1999  the decrease was due to
the repurchase of 199440 series a preferred shares and 507191 series b
preferred shares during 2000

distributions to preferred shareholders totaled 377 million for 1999 compared
to 236 million for 1998  the increase was a result of the issuance of eight
million shares of series d 750 cumulative convertible redeemable preferred
stock in december 1998

discount on preferred share repurchases
for the year ended december 31 2000 united dominion recognized 29 million of
discount on preferred share repurchases  the discount on preferred share
repurchases represents the difference between the carrying value and the
purchase price of the preferred shares

inflation
united dominion believes that the direct effects of inflation on the companys
operations have been inconsequential  substantially all of the companys leases
are for a term of one year or less which generally minimizes united dominions
risk from the adverse effects of inflation

technology initiatives
united dominion is committed to technology initiatives that will allow the
company to improve its operating efficiencies gain marketing advantages and
provide the electronic services its customers demand  among the key technology
initiatives underway are

     united dominion is developing a comprehensive ecommerce plan as part of
     this plan the company has created a new corporate home page and is in the
     process of creating home pages for each of its communities and community
     portals for residents the resident portals will allow united dominion to

search for a new ceo in the fourth quarter this search culminated with the
hiring of thomas w toomey on february 13 2001 to replace john p mccann who
served in this role for more than 26 years mr toomey has begun a review of the
organizational structure and strategy of the company this review could result

income taxes  united dominion is operated as and elects to be taxed as a real
estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as
amended the code generally a reit complies with the provisions of the code
if it distributes at least 95 of its taxable income and will avoid and will not
be subject to us federal income taxes if it distributes 100 of its income
accordingly no provision has been made for federal income taxes however
united dominion is subject to certain state and local excise or franchise taxes

the differences between net income available to common shareholders for
financial reporting purposes and taxable income before dividend deductions
relate primarily to temporary differences principally real estate depreciation
and the tax deferral of certain gains on property sales the temporary
differences in depreciation result from differences in the book and tax basis of
certain real estate assets and the differences in the methods of depreciation
and lives of the real estate assets

for income tax purposes distributions paid to common shareholders consist of
ordinary income capital gains return of capital or a combination thereof  for
the three years ended december 31 2000 distributions paid per common share
were taxable as follows

use of estimates   the preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in

investee are due to capitalized interest on the investment balance and
capitalized development and leasing costs that are recovered by the company
through fees during construction such differences are amortized on a straight
line basis over the estimated useful life of the investment during 2000 united
dominion recognized development and general contractor fees from its venture of
approximately 30 million

real estate   real estate assets held for investment are carried at historical
cost less accumulated depreciation and any recorded impairment losses

expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as
incurred significant expenditures for improvements renovations and
replacements related to the acquisition and improvement of real estate assets
are capitalized at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives

united dominion recognizes impairment losses on longlived assets used in
operations when there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an
impairment in the value of an asset and the undiscounted future cash flows are
not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value  if such indicators of
impairment are present an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of
the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value

for longlived assets to be disposed of impairment losses are recognized when
the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the
carrying value of the asset  prior to 2000 properties were classified as real
estate held for disposition when management had committed to sell and was
actively marketing the property and united dominion expected to dispose of
these properties within the next twelve months  beginning in 2000 properties
classified as real estate held for disposition represent properties that are
under contract  real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of
cost net of accumulated depreciation or fair value less the cost to dispose
determined on an asset by asset basis  depreciation is not recorded on real
estate held for disposition and gains losses from initial and subsequent
adjustments to the carrying value of the assets if any are recorded as a
separate component of income from continuing operations

depreciation is computed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets which is 35 years for buildings 10 to 35 years for
major improvements and 3 to 20 years for furniture fixtures equipment and
other assets

all development projects and related carrying costs are capitalized and reported
on the balance sheet as real estate under development until such time as the
development project is completed  upon completion the total cost of the
building and associated land is transferred to real estate held for investment
and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  the cost of
development projects includes interest real estate taxes insurance and
allocated development overhead during the construction period

interest and real estate taxes incurred during the development period are
capitalized as part of the real estate under development to the extent that such
charges do not cause the carrying value of the asset to exceed its net
realizable value during 2000 1999 and 1998 total interest capitalized was
36 million 52 million and 34 million respectively

revenue recognition   united dominions apartment homes are leased under
operating leases with terms generally of one year or less  rental income is
recognized after it is earned and collectibility is reasonably assured

restricted cash   restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders
for real estate taxes insurance and replacement reserves and security deposits

deferred financing costs   deferred financing costs include fees and other
external costs incurred to obtain debt financings and are generally amortized on
a straightline basis which approximates the effective interest method over a
period not to exceed the term of the related debt   unamortized financing costs
are writtenoff when debt is retired before its maturity date

advertising costs    all costs are expensed as incurred

interest rate swap agreements   united dominion enters into interest rate swap
agreements to alter the interest rate characteristics of outstanding debt
instruments each interest rate swap agreement is designated with all or a
portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation the
interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments over the life of
the related agreements amounts received or paid on the interest rate swaps are
recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to the related interest expense of
the outstanding debt based on the accrual method of accounting the related
amounts payable to and receivable from counterparties are included in other
liabilities and other assets respectively the fair value of and changes in the
fair value as a result of changes in market interest rates for the interest rate
swap agreements are not reflected in the basic financial statements

gains and losses on terminations of interest rate swap agreements are deferred
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the outstanding debt and amortized
into interest expense over the remaining term of the original contract life of
the terminated swap agreement  in the event of early extinguishment of a
designated debt obligation any realized or unrealized gain or loss from the
swap would be recognized in income coincident with the extinguishment gain or
loss  there were no gains or losses on terminations of interest rate swap
agreements recognized by united dominion for the periods presented

any interest rate swap agreements that are not designated with outstanding debt
or notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements in excess of the original
amounts of the underlying debt obligations are recorded as an asset or liability
at fair value with the changes in the fair value recorded in other income or
expense fair value method

interest rate risk management agreements   united dominion enters into interest
rate futures contracts to hedge interest rate risk associated with anticipated
debt transactions united dominion follows sfas no 80 accounting for futures
contracts which permits hedge accounting for anticipatory transactions meeting
certain criteria gains and losses if any on these transactions are deferred
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the outstanding debt and amortized
over the term of the related debt as an adjustment to interest expense the fair
values of interest rate risk management agreements are not recognized in the
financial statements at the time the anticipated transaction is no longer
likely to occur united dominion would record the derivative instrument at its
market value and would recognize any adjustment in the consolidated statement of
operations

earnings per share   basic earnings per common share is computed based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year  diluted

the effect of dilutive stock options and other potentially dilutive common stock
equivalents the dilutive effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive
common stock equivalents is determined using the treasury stock method based on
united dominions average stock price the early extinguishment of debt does not

the effect of the conversion of the operating partnership units and convertible
preferred stock is not dilutive and is therefore not included as a dilutive
security in the earnings per share computation the weighted average effect of
the conversion of the operating partnership units for the years ended december
31 2000 1999 and 1998 was 7489435 units 8180409 units and 2963427
units respectively the weighted average effect of the conversion of the
convertible preferred stock for the years ended december 31 2000 and 1999 was
12307692 shares and 809273 shares at december 31 1998

minority interests in operating partnerships   interests in operating
partnerships held by limited partners are represented by operating partnership
units op units the operating partnerships income is allocated to holders of
op units based upon net income available to common shareholders and the weighted
average number of op units outstanding to total common shares plus op units
outstanding during the period capital contributions distributions and profits
and losses are allocated to minority interests in accordance with the terms of
the individual partnership agreements op units can be exchanged for cash or
shares of united dominions common stock on a oneforone basis at the option
of united dominion op units as a percentage of total op units and shares
outstanding were 68 at december 31 2000 and 1999 and 77 at december 31
1998

minority interest in other partnerships   united dominion has limited partners
in certain real estate partnerships acquired as part of the acquisition of
american apartment communities ii on december 7 1998 net income for these
partnerships is allocated based on the percentage interest owned by these
limited partners in each respective real estate partnership

stock based compensation   united dominion has elected to follow accounting
principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees
apb 25 in accounting for its employee stock options because the alternative
fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 123 accounting for stock
based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options under apb 25 because the
exercise price of united dominions employee stock options equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant no compensation cost has
been recognized

impact of recently issued accounting standards   united dominion will adopt
statements of financial accounting standards no 133 and 138 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities on january 1 2001  the new
accounting standards require companies to carry all derivative instruments
including certain embedded derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at
fair value  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a
hedging relationship and if so on the reason for holding it  if certain
conditions are met companies might elect to designate a derivative instrument
as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values or cash flows  if the hedged
exposure is a cash flow exposure the effective portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument is reported as a component of equity and reclassified
into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  if the hedged
exposure is a fair value exposure the gain or loss on the derivative is
recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss
or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged  a gain or
loss is recognized in earnings when a derivative is not designated as a hedge
or when any ineffectiveness is measured in the derivative when compared to the
hedged item or anticipated transaction

united dominion estimates that upon adoption of statements 133 and 138 in
january 2001 the company will record a 38 million net transition loss
adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income equity adoption of the
standards also will result in the company recognizing 1340 thousand of
derivative instrument assets and 39 million of derivative instrument
liabilities in general the amount of volatility will vary with the level of
derivative activities during any period
