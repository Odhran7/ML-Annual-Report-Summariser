reportable segments

during the fourth quarter of 2021 certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments as a result of these changes we plan to combine our united states and canada zones to form the north america zone and expect to have two reportable segments north america and international we expect that any change to our reportable segments will be effective in the second quarter of 2022 

see note 21 segment reporting  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our geographic financial information by segment 

covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing spread of covid19 throughout the united states and internationally as well as measures implemented by governmental authorities and private businesses in an attempt to minimize transmission of the virus including social distancing mandates shelterinplace orders vaccine mandates and business restrictions and shutdowns and consumer responses to such measures and the pandemic have had and continue to have negative and positive implications for portions of our business though many areas have relaxed restrictions varying levels remain throughout the world are continuously evolving and may be increased including as a result of further outbreaks resurgences or the emergence of new variants 

we have been actively monitoring the impact of covid19 on our business in 2020 particularly in march and april we experienced consolidated net sales growth as higher demand for our retail products more than offset declines in our foodservice business in 2021 we continued to experience strong retail demand compared to prepandemic periods however retail consumption declined when compared to the comparable 2020 period based on the strong consumer demand early on in the covid19 pandemic particularly in march and april 2020 beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing through year end our foodservice business experienced increased consumer demand compared to the comparable 2020 periods which were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic however we continue to see decreased foodservice demand in certain parts of our global business including the united states and canada compared to prepandemic periods covid19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving and the longterm impacts to our financial condition and results of operations are still uncertain 

resources 

trademarks and intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2021 were 



  used under license 

we sell certain products under brands we license from third parties in 2021 brands used under licenses from third parties included capri sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the united states in addition in our agreements with mondelēz international inc “mondelēz” following the spinoff of kraft from mondelēz in 2012 we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time in 2021 in our agreements with an affiliate of groupe lactalis “lactalis” related to the sale of certain assets in our global cheese business we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in perpetuity including perpetual licenses for the kraft and velveeta brands for certain cheese products 

we also own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

raw materials and packaging 

we manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners tomatoes potatoes corn products wheat products nuts and cocoa products to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins fiberboard metals and cardboard to package our products and we use electricity diesel fuel and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our products for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change pandemics consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade tariffs alternative energy and agricultural programs in 2021 we experienced higher than expected commodity costs and supply chain costs including logistics procurement and manufacturing costs largely due to inflationary pressures we expect this cost inflation to remain elevated through at least 2022 

our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures 

research and development 

our research and development efforts focus on achieving the following four objectives 

• product innovations renovations and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs and drive growth 

• worldclass and uncompromising food safety quality and consistency 

• superior customerpreferred product and package performance and 

• continuous process improvement and product optimization in pursuit of cost reductions 

competition 

our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of ecommerce retailers largeformat retailers and discounters our competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers wholesalers and cooperatives we compete on the basis of product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

sales 

sales and customers 

our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers agents and distributors to chain wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies our products are also sold online through various ecommerce platforms and retailers our largest customer walmart inc represented approximately 22 of our net sales in both 2021 and 2020 and approximately 21 of our net sales in 2019 

additionally we have key customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers are individually significant to our consolidated business in 2021 the five largest customers in our united states segment accounted for approximately 50 of united states segment net sales the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for approximately 17 of international segment net sales and the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 74 of canada segment net sales 

we manage our sales portfolio through six consumerdriven product platforms a platform is a lens created for the portfolio based on a grouping of real consumer needs and includes the following for kraft heinz taste elevation fast fresh meals easy meals made better real food snacking flavorful hydration and easy indulgent desserts the platforms are modular and configurable by reportable segment and market further each platform is assigned a role within our business to help inform our resource allocation and investment decisions which are made at the reportable segment level these roles include grow energize and stabilize the role of a platform may also vary by reportable segment and market the platform approach helps us to manage our business efficiently including the oversight of our various product categories and brands and transforms the way we plan for our growth 

net sales by platform 

in 2021 following the divestiture of certain of our global cheese businesses we reorganized certain products within our platforms to reflect how we plan to manage our business going forward including the role assigned to these products and platforms within our business we have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented net sales by platform as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the periods presented were 



net sales by product category 

the product categories that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were 



seasonality 

although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis the majority of our products are produced throughout the year 

seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products including holidays changes in seasons or other annual events while these factors influence our quarterly net sales operating incomeloss and cash flows at the product level unless the timing of such events shift periodoverperiod eg a shift in easter timing this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results 

government regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated our business operations including the production transportation storage distribution sale display advertising marketing labeling quality and safety of our products and their ingredients and our occupational safety health and privacy practices are subject to various laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by federal state and local government agencies in the united states as well as government entities and agencies outside the united states in markets where our products are manufactured distributed or sold in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations outside of the united states including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety health and safety anticorruption and data privacy in our business dealings we are also required to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act the us trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act and various other anticorruption regulations in the regions in which we operate we rely on legal and operational compliance programs as well as inhouse and outside counsel to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business in addition regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts 

environmental regulation 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters various laws concerning the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations 

in the united states where a significant portion of our business operates these laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions under similar legislation related to certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability 

as of december 25 2021 we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves 

human capital management

our global livewell program addresses physical emotional financial and social health and wellbeing we have continued to champion the livewell program’s holistic approach to wellbeing in response to covid19 with enhanced programs including healthcare benefits disability and employee assistance initiatives 

diversity inclusion and belonging 

we live our value of we demand diversity by focusing on three strategic areas hiring and growing talent from diverse backgrounds and perspectives developing inclusive leaders and tracking and reporting our progress in 2021 we shared our 2025 diversity inclusion and belonging aspirations which include that 50 of our global management positions be filled by women and 30 of our salaried us employee population identify as people of color as of december 25 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered when evaluating kraft heinz although the risks are organized and described separately many of the risks are interrelated while we believe we have identified and discussed the material risks affecting our business below there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

industry risks 

the continuously changing and uncertain covid19 pandemic and government and consumer responses could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

the ongoing spread of covid19 throughout the united states and internationally as well as measures implemented by governmental authorities and private businesses in an attempt to minimize transmission of the virus including social distancing mandates shelterinplace orders vaccine mandates and business restrictions and shutdowns and consumer responses have had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business although certain portions of our business have benefited the impact of and associated government business and consumer responses to covid19 could negatively impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways which may be difficult to accurately estimate or forecast including but not limited to the following 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities due to illness could significantly disrupt our production capabilities 

• a significant portion of our workforce could become unable to work including as a result of illness or government restrictions 

• a decrease in demand for awayfromhome establishments has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our foodservice operations 

• a change in demand resulting from restrictions on or changes in social interactions has affected and could continue to affect customers’ and consumers’ plans to purchase our products 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers distributors or carriers modifying their restocking fulfillment or shipping practices 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower margin products 

• a slowdown or stoppage in our supply chain or the failure of our suppliers vendors distributors or thirdparty manufacturers to meet their obligations to us or experience disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a strain on our supply chain resulting from increased consumer demand at our retail customers such as grocery stores club stores and value stores 

• a change in trade promotion and marketing activities eg in response to changes in consumer viewing and shopping habits resulting from the cancellation of major events travel restrictions and instore shopping practices could adversely affect our current and future product sales 

• an impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets or a change in the useful life of definitelived intangible assets has occurred and may again occur if there are sustained changes in government restrictions consumer purchasing behaviors or our financial results particularly in our canada foodservice reporting unit as there may be a heightened risk of impairment if there is a sustained decrease in demand in awayfromhome establishments 

• a change in our fiveyear operating plan which could cause a change in the allocation of investments among our reporting units our growth expectations and our fair value estimates each of which could result in an impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets and 

• an increase in working capital needs andor an increase in trade receivables writeoffs as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers 

additionally should any key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work the attention of the management team and resources could be diverted 

the potential effects of covid19 could also heighten the risks we face related to each of the risk factors disclosed below as covid19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving the potential impacts to these risk factors remain uncertain as a result covid19 may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present material risks to our operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products we compete based on product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including pressures related to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices these pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases including those related to inflationary pressures failure to effectively assess timely change and properly set pricing promotions or trade incentives may negatively impact our ability to achieve our objectives 

the rapid emergence of new distribution channels particularly ecommerce may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases including those related to inflationary pressures we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product platform or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may decline 

our success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovation 

consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness moreover weak economic conditions recessions inflation or other factors such as global or local pandemics and severe or unusual weather events could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we must distinguish between shortterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfies a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or platforms or if we do not rapidly develop products in fastergrowing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products including as they relate to obesity or other health concerns could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may continue to consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels these larger customers may seek to leverage their positions to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing more favorable terms increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding adverse effect on us which could be material for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets if we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers or in other business relationships could adversely impact us 

we derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers see sales and customers within item 1 business  some or all of our significant customers may not continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results in addition terminations of relationships with other significant contractual counterparties including licensors could adversely affect our portfolio product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition the financial condition of such customers suppliers and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers or suppliers or in other business relationships could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition across the globe our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation negative perceptions of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of our marketing practices moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us our quality and safety our environmental or social impacts our products becoming unavailable to consumers or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ or our consumers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations furthermore existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our 

advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation in addition we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts anticipate consumer preferences or invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation or brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as private label products which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or inflation consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive such a change if consumers prefer private label products then we could lose market share or sales volumes or our product mix could shift to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms increase our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories 

our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms as well as growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories or platforms and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories or platforms our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or platforms or develop innovative products for new and existing categories or platforms could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we have decided and could in the future decide to and have been or could in the future be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration product mislabeling or misbranding tampering undeclared allergens or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued to conclusion the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

climate change and legal or regulatory responses may have a longterm adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

global average temperatures are gradually increasing due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which may contribute to significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of natural resources and commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners tomatoes potatoes corn products wheat products nuts cocoa products cucumbers onions other fruits and vegetables spices and flour used to 

manufacture our products and could further decrease food security for communities around the world climate change could also affect our ability to procure necessary commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures increasing concern over climate change may also adversely impact demand for our products or increase operating costs due to changes in consumer preferences that cause consumers to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have a high climate change impact 

additionally there is an increased focus by foreign federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions energy policies and sustainability increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to the impacts of climate change and additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change or designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment could be costly and may cause disruptions in or an increase in the costs associated with the running of our manufacturing and processing facilities and our business as well as increase distribution and supply chain costs moreover compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations and strategy which will likely incur substantial time attention and costs even if we make changes to align ourselves with such legal or regulatory requirements we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices the effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a longterm adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

finally we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media stockholders activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters such failure or the perception that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional regulatory requirements regarding climate change whether or not valid could result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business and reputation moreover from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments including to reduce our impact on the environment our ability to achieve any stated goal target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions many of which are outside of our control examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or imposing different requirements the pace of changes in technology the availability of requisite financing and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards if we fail to achieve or are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving or improperly report on our progress toward achieving these goals and commitments it could negatively affect consumer preference for our products or investor confidence in our stock as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation 

business risks 

we may not successfully identify complete or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures joint ventures or other investments 

from time to time we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates alliances joint ventures or other investments that may strategically fit our business objectives and as a result of some of these evaluations we have acquired businesses or assets that we deem to be a strategic fit we have also divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states canada the european union the united kingdom and other jurisdictions we have in the past and may in the future be required to obtain approval of these transactions by competition authorities or to satisfy other legal requirements and we may be unable to obtain such approvals or satisfy such requirements each of which may result in additional costs time delays or our inability to complete such transactions 

to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances joint ventures investments or other developments outside our established regions or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the fcpa foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

to the extent we undertake divestitures we may face additional risks related to such activities for example risks related to our ability to find appropriate buyers execute transactions on favorable terms separate divested business operations with minimal impact to our remaining operations and effectively manage any transitional service arrangements further our divestiture activities have in the past required and may in the future require us to recognize impairment charges any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives 

we plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets consumer demands behaviors tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and as a result our sales strategies may not be successful and our product sales may not meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations additionally we may not successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives including achieving any previously announced productivity efficiencies and financial targets any new business may not be profitable or meet our expectations or any divestiture may not be completed without disruption any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

we are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets approximately 29 of our 2021 net sales were generated outside of the united states as a result we are subject to risks inherent in global operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include 

• compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states including antibribery laws such as the fcpa 

• changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications 

• the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or imports trade agreements regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales or costs 

• foreign currency devaluations or fluctuations in foreign currency values including risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in foreign currency exchange markets and the decisions made and positions taken to hedge such volatility 

• compliance with antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions 

• discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions 

• changes in capital controls including foreign currency exchange controls governmental foreign currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the united states 

• challenges associated with crossborder product distribution 

• changes in local regulations and laws the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources 

• risks and costs associated with political and economic instability corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate 

• the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations 

• greater risk of uncollectible accounts or trade receivables and longer collection cycles and 

• design implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our various operations and employee base 

slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets trade dress copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to develop or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition we also license certain intellectual property most notably trademarks from third parties to the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future 

as of december 25 2021 the sponsors own approximately 42 of our common stock two of 11 members of our board are partners andor board members of 3g capital and two members of our board are officers andor directors of berkshire hathaway andor its affiliates in addition paulo basilio our global chief financial officer is a partner of 3g capital as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over board decisions including those affecting our capital structure such as the issuance of additional capital stock the incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the declaration and amount of dividends the sponsors also have substantial control over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors were to collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take stockholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock furthermore the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness 

we have implemented a number of initiatives including development of an operations center and strategic longterm collaboration with suppliers that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure and operations to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any costsaving efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production profitability financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

our level of indebtedness as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt our existing debt together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences including but not limited to 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures research and development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes 

• resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating which could adversely affect our cost of funds including our commercial paper programs liquidity and access to capital markets 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged 

• making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations payments of dividends capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

• exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of foreign currencies and the majority of our debt is denominated in us dollars and 

• in the case of any additional indebtedness exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage 

in addition we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future debt or equity financings may not be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our indebtedness instruments contain customary representations warranties and covenants including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “senior credit facility” to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses the creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines or if we are unable to comply with any covenant such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the sec we have in the past needed and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default 

if we breach any covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors or we may not be able to remedy compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments and unable to access our senior credit facility in addition certain creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

additional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 25 2021 we maintain 14 reporting units nine of which comprise our goodwill balance our indefinitelived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands  we test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections disposals of significant brands or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster pandemic or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate changes in income tax rates changes in interest rates or changes in management strategy we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions these assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates royalty rates contributory asset charges and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates income tax rates foreign currency exchange rates or any factors that could be 

affected by covid19 change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including updates to our longterm operating plans then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth additionally any decisions to divest certain nonstrategic assets has led and could in the future lead to goodwill or intangible asset impairments 

further certain organizational changes have previously impacted and could in the future impact our internal reporting and reportable segments these changes may also affect our reporting unit structure and require an interim impairment test or transition test we expect the organizational changes we announced in the fourth quarter of 2021 to impact our future internal reporting reportable segments and reporting unit structure and to require an interim impairment test in the second quarter of 2022 once the changes are effective additionally any future plans to change reporting units including as a result of integrating a new acquisition into an existing reporting unit that has a fair value below carrying amount of goodwill has led and could in the future lead to an impairment of goodwill 

as a result of our annual and interim impairment tests and impairment tests related to assets held for sale we recognized goodwill impairment losses of 318 million and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 13 billion in 2021 goodwill impairment losses of 23 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 11 billion in 2020 and goodwill impairment losses of 12 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 702 million in 2019 our reporting units and brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates accordingly these and other reporting units and brands that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the latest 2021 impairment testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future reporting units with 20 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 283 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date and included enhancers specialty and away from home esa kids snacks and beverages ksb meal foundations and coffee mfc canada retail canada foodservice and puerto rico reporting units with between 2050 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 22 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date and included northern europe and asia the continental europe reporting unit had a fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50 and a goodwill carrying amount of 961 million as of its latest 2021 impairment testing date brands with 20 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of 213 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date and included kraft  oscar mayer  velveeta  miracle whip  lunchables oreida maxwell house  classico cool whip  jet puffed  plasmon  and wattie’s the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 65 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date although the remaining brands with a carrying value of 118 billion have more than 50 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date these amounts are also associated with the 2013 heinz acquisition and the 2015 merger and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values therefore if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future these amounts are also susceptible to impairments 

our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

we derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the canadian dollar british pound sterling euro australian dollar chinese renminbi indonesian rupiah new zealand dollar brazilian real and russian ruble since our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented foreign currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 

commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners tomatoes potatoes corn products wheat products nuts cocoa products cucumbers onions other fruits and vegetables spices and flour to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins fiberboard metals cardboard glass paper plastic and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as electricity natural gas and water to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices including diesel fuel which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources foreign currency fluctuations severe weather natural disasters global climate change water risk health pandemics crop failures crop shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade tariffs alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and 

agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations furthermore the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

although we monitor our exposure to commodity and other input prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as liquid as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer pressures if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

in 2021 we experienced higher than expected commodity costs and supply chain costs including logistics procurement and manufacturing costs largely due to inflationary pressures we expect this cost inflation to remain elevated through at least 2022 although we take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains if these measures are not effective our financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected even if such measures are effective we expect that there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred additionally the pricing actions we take could result in a decrease in market share 

volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income 

we use commodity futures options and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs including vegetable oils diesel fuel corn products packaging products sugar coffee beans wheat products meat products natural gas dairy products and cocoa products we recognize gains and losses based on changes in the values of these commodity derivatives we recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we recognize the unrealized gains and losses on these commodity derivatives in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results accordingly changes in the values of our commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income 

regulatory risks 

our compliance with laws and regulations and related legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation 

as a large global food and beverage company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks various laws and regulations govern our practices including but not limited to those related to advertising and marketing product claims and labeling the environment intellectual property consumer protection and product liability commercial disputes trade and export controls antitrust data privacy labor and employment workplace health and safety and tax as a consequence we face a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions in the ordinary course of business in addition the imposition of new laws changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made manufactured distributed and sold have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs capital expenditures and higher production costs adversely impacting our product sales financial condition and results of operations furthermore actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make in response to the covid19 pandemic may result in investigations legal claims or litigation against us 

as a result of any such legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions we could be subject to monetary judgments settlements and civil and criminal actions including fines injunctions product recalls penalties disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions which could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows we evaluate these legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate if possible the amount of potential losses based on these assessments and estimates we establish reserves and disclose relevant material litigation claims legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions as appropriate and in accordance with sec rules and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” 

our assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of judgment actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates in addition even if a claim is unsuccessful without merit or not pursued to completion the cost of defending against or responding to such a claim including expenses and management time could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results which could negatively impact our business investor confidence and the price of our common stock 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 28 2019 we identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control over financial reporting as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of misstatement due to changes in our business environment this material weakness resulted in misstatements that were corrected in the restatement included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 29 2018 this material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to a material weakness arising from supplier contracts and related arrangements we completed remediation measures related to the material weaknesses and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 27 2020 completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly or remain adequate 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected which could subject us to litigation investigations or penalties negatively affect our liquidity our access to capital markets perceptions of our creditworthiness our ability to complete acquisitions our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports or investor confidence in our financial reporting or cause defaults accelerations or crossaccelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or to cure any breaches any of which may require management resources or cause our stock price to decline 

a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings 

our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm credit ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these credit ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in february 2020 moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” affirmed our longterm credit rating of baa3 with a negative outlook and fitch ratings “fitch” and sp global ratings “sp” downgraded our longterm credit rating from bbb to bb with a stable outlook from fitch and a negative outlook from sp the downgrades by fitch and sp reduce our senior debt below investment grade potentially resulting in higher borrowing costs on future financings and limiting access to our commercial paper program and other sources of funding which may result in us having to use more expensive sources of liquidity such as our senior credit facility these downgrades do not constitute a default or event of default under our debt instruments as of the date of this filing we maintain a positive outlook from fitch and sp and a stable outlook from moody’s 

registered securities risks 

sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market sales of our common stock by the sponsors or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities a sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened which was a contributing factor to our decision to perform interim impairment tests for certain reporting units and brands in 2019 for which we ultimately recorded impairment losses and could in the future happen which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets which could increase the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

kraft heinz 3g global food holdings and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g global food holdings and berkshire hathaway which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of december 25 2021 registrable shares represented approximately 42 of all outstanding shares of our common stock although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a “lockup” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly offers and sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement sales of our common stock by the sponsors to other persons would likely result in an 

increase in the number of shares being traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the board and may be limited by our financial condition debt agreements or limitations under delaware law 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof will be at the discretion of the board and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law debt agreements and other factors the board deems relevant the board has previously decided and may in the future decide in its sole discretion to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons stockholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

general risk factors 

unanticipated business disruptions and natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers distributors or regulators operate could adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers or our results of operations 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned and leased manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather or other geological events or natural disasters including hurricanes earthquakes floods tsunamis or wild fires raw material shortages fires or explosions political unrest geopolitical conflicts terrorism civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation generalized labor unrest or labor shortages or health pandemics including covid19 could damage or disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers comanufacturers distributors or regulators these factors include but are not limited to 

• natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ or distributors’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products and 

• influenza or other pandemics such as covid19 could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the awayfromhome or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations 

these or other disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network while we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to manage business continuity planning such insurance may not compensate us for any losses incurred and our business continuity plans may not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner to the extent we are unable to respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems or to financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage them if they occur we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers or to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do business 

our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets changes to major international trade arrangements and the imposition of tariffs by certain foreign governments could negatively impact our operations and sales for example in 2020 the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and subsequently entered into a trade agreement with the european union and we continue to monitor economic and political developments related to brexit including the potential for supply chain disruptions other factors impacting our operations in the united states and in international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions and our responses to them could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel and a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business unplanned turnover failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions including the chief executive officer position could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees any such loss failure or limitation could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyberattacks and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions reputational damage transaction errors processing inefficiencies the leakage of confidential information and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations damage to our reputation and credibility loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of our ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or consumers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving and developing regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data such laws and regulations as well as their interpretation and application may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction which can result in inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 adds a broad array of requirements with respect to personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective in january 2020 among other things imposes additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of california residents the ccpa provides civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches gdpr ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of noncompliance which could result in substantial penalties 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures shortages in the labor market increased employee turnover and changes in the availability of our workers could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements 

furthermore we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with unionrepresented employees both in and outside of the united states 

we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market increased employee turnover changes in the availability of our workers including as a result of covid19related absences and labor shortages in our supply chain have resulted in and could continue to result in increased costs and have and could again impact our ability to meet consumer demand both of which could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed additionally the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate a number of factors influence our effective tax rate including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules federal state and local governments and administrative bodies within the united states which represents the majority of our operations and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented or are considering a variety of broad tax trade and other regulatory reforms that may impact us moreover under the current us presidential administration comprehensive changes to us federal income tax laws have been proposed including among others a proposal to increase the federal tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” additionally the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd a global coalition of member countries proposed a twopillar plan to reform international taxation the proposals aim to ensure a fairer distribution of profits among countries and impose a floor on tax competition through the introduction of a global minimum tax it is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes but these changes could have a material impact on our effective tax rate financial condition and business 

significant judgment knowledge and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in geographic mix of income increases in expenses not deductible for tax including impairment of goodwill and changes in available tax credits in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult the results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt our us dollar variable rate debt uses london interbank offered rate “libor” as a benchmark for determining interest rates and the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom intends to phase out the libor rates associated with our outstanding variable rate debt by the end of june 2023 based on our review of our debt securities credit facilities including our uncommitted revolving credit line derivative instruments and certain of our significant commercial contracts that may utilize libor as the reference rate we do not currently expect that the transition from libor including any legal or regulatory changes made in response to its future phase out or the risks related to its discontinuance will have a material effect on our financing costs however we continue to evaluate the potential impact which remains subject to uncertainty 

some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable increasing our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

objective 

the following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations from managements perspective and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k our objective is to also provide discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition and to offer information that provides an understanding of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

see below for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020 see item 7 management’s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 26 2020 for a detailed discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 

description of the company 

we manufacture and market food and beverage products including condiments and sauces cheese and dairy meals meats refreshment beverages coffee and other grocery products throughout the world 

we manage and report our operating results through three reportable segments defined by geographic region united states international and canada 

during the fourth quarter of 2021 certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments as a result of these changes we plan to combine our united states and canada zones to form the north america zone and expect to have two reportable segments north america and international we expect that any change to our reportable segments will be effective in the second quarter of 2022 

see note 21 segment reporting  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our financial information by segment 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in 2021 we completed the sale of certain assets in our global nuts business the “nuts transaction” as well as the sale of certain assets in our global cheese businesses the “cheese transaction” the nuts transaction and the cheese transaction are not individually or in the aggregate considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results therefore the results of these businesses are included in continuing operations through the date of each sale additionally in 2021 we completed the acquisition of assan gıda sanayi ve ticaret aŞ the “assan foods acquisition” and br spices indústria e comércio de alimentos ltda the “br spices acquisition” both of which are in our international segment see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information 

items affecting comparability of financial results 

impairment losses 

our results of operations reflect goodwill impairment losses of 318 million and intangible asset impairment losses of 13 billion in 2021 compared to goodwill impairment losses of 23 billion and intangible asset impairment losses of 11 billion in 2020 see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  and note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on these impairment losses 

covid19 impacts 

we have been actively monitoring the impact of covid19 on our business in 2020 particularly in march and april we experienced consolidated net sales growth as higher demand for our retail products more than offset declines in our foodservice business in 2021 we continued to experience strong retail demand compared to prepandemic periods however retail consumption declined when compared to the comparable 2020 period based on the strong consumer demand early on in the covid19 pandemic particularly in march and april 2020 beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and continuing through year end our foodservice business experienced increased consumer demand compared to the comparable 2020 periods which were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic however we continue to see decreased foodservice demand in certain parts of our global business including the united states and canada compared to prepandemic periods covid19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving and the longterm impacts to our financial condition and results of operations are still uncertain 

see liquidity and capital resources for additional information related to the impact of covid19 on our overall results for information related to the impact of covid19 on our segment results see results of operations by segment  

inflation and supply chain impacts 

in 2021 we experienced higher than expected commodity costs and supply chain costs including logistics procurement and manufacturing costs largely due to inflationary pressures we expect this cost inflation to remain elevated through at least 2022 while these costs have a negative impact on our results of operations we are currently taking measures to mitigate and expect to continue to take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation through pricing actions and efficiency gains however we expect that there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred additionally the pricing actions we take could result in a decrease in market share 

additionally given the increased demand for our products combined with industrywide supply chain issues we have experienced capacity constraints for certain products when demand has exceeded our current manufacturing capacity as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  we are working to expand capacity through increased capital investments however until these capacity constraints are alleviated these constraints have the potential to impact our service levels market share financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we have observed an increasingly competitive labor market increased employee turnover changes in the availability of our workers including as a result of covid19related absences and labor shortages in our supply chain have resulted in and could continue to result in increased costs and have and could again impact our ability to meet consumer demand both of which could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 

operating incomeloss increased to 35 billion in 2021 compared to 21 billion in 2020 primarily driven by lower noncash impairment losses in the current year noncash impairment losses were 16 billion in 2021 compared to 34 billion in 2020 the remaining change in operating incomeloss was a decrease of 447 million primarily due to higher supply chain costs reflecting inflationary pressure in logistics procurement and manufacturing costs higher commodity costs including key commodity which we define as dairy meat and coffee and packaging costs the unfavorable impact of divestitures higher restructuring expenses in the current period and costs relating to the settlement of the previously disclosed sec investigation these decreases to operating incomeloss more than offset efficiency gains higher organic net sales the favorable impact of foreign currency lower general corporate expenses and lower depreciation and amortization expense 

net incomeloss increased 1837 to 10 billion in 2021 compared to 361 million in 2020 this increase was driven by the operating incomeloss factors discussed above primarily lower noncash impairment losses in the current year period which more than offset higher interest expense and higher tax expense other expenseincome was flat year over year 

• interest expense was 20 billion in 2021 compared to 14 billion in 2020 this increase was primarily driven by a 917 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in the current year period related to the 60 billion reduction in our aggregate principal amount of senior notes from our tender offers debt redemptions and openmarket debt repurchases in 2021 compared to a 124 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in the prior year in connection with our tender offer and debt redemptions in 2020 the 2020 period also included 22 million of interest expense related to the 40 billion drawn on our senior credit facility in the first quarter of 2020 and repaid in the second quarter of 2020 the remaining change in interest expense was a decrease of approximately 118 million compared to the prior year period as our longterm debt balance and associated interest expense were reduced through tender offers debt redemptions debt repurchases and repayments 

• our effective tax rate was 401 in 2021 compared to 650 in 2020 our 2021 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items primarily the tax impacts related to acquisitions and divestitures which mainly reflect the impacts of the nuts transaction and cheese transaction partially offset by current year capital losses the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international and state tax rates mainly an increase in uk tax rates the impact of the federal tax on gilti and nondeductible goodwill impairments these impacts were partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of pretax income in various nonus jurisdictions our 2020 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items primarily related to nondeductible goodwill impairments the impact of the federal tax on gilti and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international tax laws these impacts were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pretax income in various nonus jurisdictions and the favorable impact of establishing certain deferred tax assets for state tax deductions 

• other expenseincome was 295 million of income in 2021 compared to 296 million of income in 2020 this change was primarily driven by an 86 million net loss on derivative activities in 2021 compared to a 154 million net gain on derivative activities in 2020 and a 115 million decrease in noncash amortization of postemployment benefit plans prior service credits as compared to the prior year period these impacts were partially offset by a 101 million net foreign exchange gain in 2021 compared to a 162 million net foreign exchange loss in 2020 a 44 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2021 compared to a 2 million net loss on sales of businesses in 2020 and a 26 million loss on the dissolution of a joint venture in 2020

results of operations by segment 

management evaluates segment performance based on several factors including net sales organic net sales and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome provision forbenefit from income taxes and depreciation and amortization excluding restructuring activities in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of divestiturerelated license income eg income related to the sale of licenses in connection with the cheese transaction restructuring activities deal costs unrealized gainslosses on commodity hedges the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results impairment losses certain nonordinary course legal and regulatory matters and equity award compensation expense excluding restructuring activities segment adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in other expenseincome on our consolidated statement of income as nonmonetary currency devaluation rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on our consolidated balance sheet until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary see note 2 significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities and senior credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs repayments of longterm debt future contractual obligations payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends planned capital expenditures restructuring expenditures and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans for the next 12 months and to fund our announced acquisitions an additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets we intend to use our cash on hand for daily funding requirements 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in the second quarter of 2021 we received approximately 34 billion of cash consideration following the closing of the nuts transaction in connection with the nuts transaction we paid approximately 700 million of cash taxes in the second half of 2021 primarily to us federal and state tax authorities we primarily utilized the posttax transaction proceeds along with cash on hand to fund opportunistic repayments of longterm debt including our tender offers in the second quarter of 2021 and our debt redemption and open market debt repurchases in the third quarter of 2021

cash flow activity for 2021 compared to 2020 

net cash provided byused for operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 54 billion for the year ended december 25 2021 compared to 49 billion for the year ended december 26 2020 this increase was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of licenses in connection with the cheese transaction favorable changes in accounts payable compared to the prior year largely due to favorable payment terms and lower cash outflows for inventories these impacts were partially offset by higher cash tax payments on divestitures in 2021 related to the nuts transaction higher cash outflows for variable compensation in 2021 compared to 2020 higher cash outflows from increased promotional activity versus the prior year period and lower adjusted ebitda 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 40 billion for the year ended december 25 2021 compared to net cash used for investing activities of 522 million for the year ended december 26 2020 this change was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of net assets in connection with the nuts transaction and the cheese transaction in the current year partially offset by higher capital expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020 and the payments for the assan foods acquisition and the br spices acquisition in 2021 we had 2021 capital expenditures of 905 million compared to 2020 capital expenditures of 596 million this increase is primarily due to increased capital investments largely for capacity expansion and the covid19 pandemic which caused delays in our planned 2020 projects and spend we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately 10 billion primarily driven by increased capital investments largely for capacity expansion and cost improvement projects maintenance and technology 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 93 billion for the year ended december 25 2021 compared to 33 billion for the year ended december 26 2020 this change was primarily due to prior year proceeds from longterm debt issuances higher repayments of longterm debt and debt prepayment and extinguishment costs in 2021 compared to 2020 and higher cash outflows related to equity awards in 2021 compared to 2020 see note 17 debt  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our longterm debt activity 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

of the 34 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at december 25 2021 867 million was held by international subsidiaries 

subsequent to january 1 2018 we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested for those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our us cash requirements the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our 2018 through 2021 accumulated earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately 50 million 

our undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through december 30 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested related to these undistributed historic earnings we had recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 10 million on approximately 135 million of historic earnings at december 25 2021 and a deferred tax liability of approximately 20 million on approximately 300 million of historic earnings at december 26 2020 the deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed 

trade payables programs 

in order to manage our cash flow and related liquidity we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable generally range from 0 to 200 days we also maintain agreements with third party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us and at the sole discretion of the supplier sell one or more of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary we estimate that the amounts outstanding under these programs were 820 million at december 25 2021 and 740 million at december 26 2020 

borrowing arrangements 

in february 2020 fitch and sp downgraded our longterm credit rating from bbb to bb these downgrades adversely affect our ability to access the commercial paper market in addition we could experience an increase in interest costs as a result of the downgrades these downgrades do not constitute a default or event of default under any of our debt instruments limitations on or elimination of our ability to access the commercial paper program may require us to borrow under the senior credit facility if necessary to meet liquidity needs our ability to borrow under the senior credit facility is not affected by the downgrades as of the date of this filing our longterm debt is rated bb by both fitch and sp and baa3 by moody’s with a positive outlook from fitch and sp and a stable outlook from moody’s 

we have historically obtained funding through our us and european commercial paper programs we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 25 2021 at december 26 2020 or during the years ended december 25 2021 or december 26 2020 

we maintain our senior credit facility which following the execution of a commitment increase amendment to the credit agreement in october 2020 and the extension letter agreement in april 2021 provides for a revolving commitment of 41 billion through july 6 2023 and 40 billion through july 6 2025 subject to certain conditions we may increase the amount of revolving commitments andor add tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to 900 million 

in the first quarter of 2020 as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global economy resulting from the covid19 pandemic we borrowed 40 billion under our senior credit facility we repaid the full 40 billion during the second quarter of 2020 no amounts were drawn on our senior credit facility at december 25 2021 at december 26 2020 or during the years ended december 25 2021 and december 28 2019 

the credit agreement contains representations warranties and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could upon the occurrence of certain events of default restrict our ability to access our senior credit facility we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 25 2021 

longterm debt 

our longterm debt including the current portion was 218 billion at december 25 2021 and 283 billion at december 26 2020 this decrease was primarily driven by the approximately 41 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were settled in connection with tender offers in 2021 the approximately 12 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes redeemed in 2021 the approximately 738 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased under rule 10b51 plans in 2021 the 111 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in february 2021 and the 34 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in september 2021 we used cash on hand and proceeds from the nuts transaction to fund our tender offers in the second quarter of 2021 and our debt redemption and open market debt repurchases in the third quarter of 2021 and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith we used proceeds from the cheese transaction to fund our open market repurchases and tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2021 and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith 

we have aggregate principal amounts of senior notes of approximately 6 million maturing in march 2022 approximately 381 million maturing in june 2022 and approximately 315 million maturing in august 2022 

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions tender offers cash purchases prepayments refinancing exchange offers open market or privatelynegotiated transactions rule 10b51 plans or otherwise 

our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default we were in compliance with all financial covenants during the year ended december 25 2021 

see note 17 debt  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our longterm debt activity see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on the nuts transaction and cheese transaction 

equity and dividends 

we paid common stock dividends of 20 billion in 2021 2020 and 2019 additionally in the first quarter of 2022 our board declared a cash dividend of 040 per share of common stock which is payable on march 25 2022 to stockholders of record on march 11 2022 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

aggregate contractual obligations 

related to our current and longterm material cash requirements the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at december 25 2021 which we expect to primarily fund with cash from operating activities in millions 



a amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt including interest on variable and fixed rate longterm debt interest on variable rate longterm debt is calculated based on interest rates at december 25 2021 

b amounts represent the expected cash payments of our finance leases including expected cash payments of interest expense 

c operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases net of sublease income 

d we have purchase obligations for materials supplies property plant and equipment and copacking storage and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction several of these obligations are longterm and are based on minimum purchase requirements certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations we do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations 

e other longterm liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the onetime toll charge related to 2017 us tax reform as well as postretirement benefit commitments certain other longterm liabilities related to income taxes insurance accruals and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items 

pension plan contributions were 15 million in 2021 we estimate that 2022 pension plan contributions will be approximately 12 million postretirement benefit plan contributions were 12 million in 2021 we estimate that 2022 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately 13 million estimated future contributions take into consideration current economic conditions which at this time are expected to have minimal impact on expected contributions for 2022 beyond 2022 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension or postretirement plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension or postretirement asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated pension and postretirement plan contributions for 2022 have been excluded from the above table 

at december 25 2021 the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 521 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners tomatoes potatoes corn products wheat products nuts and cocoa products to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins fiberboard metals and cardboard to package our products and we use electricity diesel fuel and natural gas in the manufacturing and distribution of our products we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities 

following the closing of the nuts transaction in the second quarter of 2021 our purchase and use of nuts has significantly decreased as such we no longer consider nuts to be one of our key commodities in the united states and canada 

we define our key commodities in the united states and canada as dairy meat and coffee in 2021 we experienced cost increases for meat and coffee while costs for dairy decreased we also experienced cost increases for packaging materials due to market demand we anticipate higher commodity costs to continue through at least 2022 due to inflationary pressures we manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies as a result of these risk management strategies our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends 

in 2021 dairy commodities primarily milk and cheese were the most significant cost components of our cheese products following the closing of the cheese transaction we expect dairy commodities primarily milk cream and cheese to be the most significant components of our cheese products in 2022 we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components of our meat products include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on global markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices 

critical accounting estimates 

note 2 significant accounting policies  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products we recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers we record revenues net of variable consideration including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions excluding taxes and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs we also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors we recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year 

advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates performancebased instore display activities and volumebased incentives variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization redemption rates andor current period experience factors we review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information 

advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information in 2021 we updated our definition of advertising expenses to reflect a more comprehensive view of costs that promote our brands to create or stimulate a desire to buy our products our definition of advertising expenses now includes advertising production costs instore advertising costs agency fees brand promotions and events and sponsorships in addition to costs to obtain advertising in television radio print digital and social channels we have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented we recorded advertising expenses of 1039 million in 2021 1070 million in 2020 and 976 million in 2019 we also incur market research costs which are recorded in sga but are excluded from advertising expenses 

goodwill and intangible assets 

as of december 25 2021 we maintain 14 reporting units nine of which comprise our goodwill balance these nine reporting units had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 313 billion at december 25 2021 our indefinitelived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands which had an aggregate carrying amount of 394 billion as of december 25 2021 

we test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections disposals of significant brands or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster pandemic or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate changes in income tax rates changes in interest rates or changes in management strategy we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions these assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates royalty rates contributory asset charges and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates income tax rates foreign currency exchange rates or any factors that could be affected by covid19 change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including updates to our longterm operating plans then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future additionally any decisions to divest certain nonstrategic assets has led and could in the future lead to goodwill or intangible asset impairments 

in 2020 and 2021 the covid19 pandemic has produced a shortterm beneficial financial impact to our consolidated results retail sales have increased compared to prepandemic periods due to higher than anticipated consumer demand for our products the foodservice channel however has experienced a negative impact from prolonged social distancing mandates limiting access to and capacity at awayfromhome establishments for a longer period of time than was expected when they were originally put in place our canada foodservice reporting unit is the most exposed of our reporting units to the longterm 

impacts to awayfromhome establishments as it is our only standalone foodservice reporting unit while our other reporting units have varying levels of exposure to the foodservice channel they also have exposure to the retail channel which offsets some of the risk associated with the potential longterm impacts of shifts in net sales between retail and awayfromhome establishments our canada foodservice reporting unit was impaired during our 2020 annual impairment test reflecting our best estimate at that time of the future outlook and risks of this business the canada foodservice reporting unit maintains an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of approximately 154 million as of december 25 2021 a number of factors could result in further future impairments of our foodservice businesses including but not limited to mandates around closures of dining rooms in restaurants distancing of people within establishments resulting in fewer customers the total number of restaurant closures changes in consumer preferences or regulatory requirements over product formats eg table top packaging vs single serve packaging and consumer trends of diningin versus diningout given the evolving nature of and uncertainty driven by the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the impact on our reporting units as adverse changes to these assumptions could result in future impairments 

as we consider the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic with regard to our indefinitelived intangible assets a number of factors could have a future adverse impact on our brands including changes in consumer and consumption trends in both the short and long term the extent of government mandates to shelter in place total number of restaurant closures economic declines and reductions in consumer discretionary income we have seen an increase in our retail business as compared to prepandemic levels in the short term that has more than offset declines in our foodservice business over the same period our brands are generally common across both the retail and foodservice businesses and the fair value of our brands are subject to a similar mix of positive and negative factors given the evolving nature and uncertainty driven by the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the impact on our brands 

as detailed in note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we recorded impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our reporting units and brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates accordingly these and other reporting units and brands that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future 

reporting units with 20 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 283 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date and included enhancers specialty and away from home esa kids snacks and beverages ksb meal foundations and coffee mfc canada retail canada foodservice and puerto rico reporting units with between 2050 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 22 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date and included northern europe and asia the continental europe reporting unit had a fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50 and a goodwill carrying amount of 961 million as of its latest 2021 impairment testing date our reporting units that have less than 3 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date are considered at a heightened risk of future impairments and include our canada retail and puerto rico reporting units which had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 14 billion additionally our reporting units with no goodwill carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date are at risk of future impairment to the extent there is newly acquired goodwill assigned to the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit including the acquisition fair value does not exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit including the acquired net assets 

brands with 20 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of 213 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date and included kraft  oscar mayer  velveeta  miracle whip  lunchables oreida maxwell house  classico cool whip  jet puffed  plasmon  and wattie’s the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 65 billion as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date although the remaining brands with a carrying amount of 118 billion have more than 50 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date these amounts are also associated with the 2013 heinz acquisition and the 2015 merger and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values therefore if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future these amounts are also susceptible to impairments our brands that have less than 3 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date are considered at a heightened risk of future impairments and include our kraft  miracle whip  oreida  maxwell house  classico  and plasmon brands which had an aggregate carrying amount of 142 billion 

we generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit including net sales cost of products sold sga depreciation and amortization working capital and capital expenditures income tax rates longterm growth rates and a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

we utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand including net sales cost of products sold and sga contributory asset charges income tax considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

we utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand royalty rates as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee income tax considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

as detailed in note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  the cheese transaction closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 we received total consideration of approximately 334 billion which included approximately 159 billion primarily attributed to the kraft and velveeta licenses that we granted to lactalis and approximately 141 million attributed to the cracker barrel license that lactalis granted to us the amounts of which were based on the estimated fair values of the licensed portion of each brand as of the closing date of the cheese transaction we utilized the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the licensed portion of the kraft brand and the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the licensed portions of the velveeta brand and the cracker barrel brand some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating these fair values include the estimated future annual net sales and net cash flows for each brand contributory asset charges royalty rates as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee income tax considerations longterm growth rates and a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to each brand we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates and guideline companies 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 at the time the licensed rights were granted we reassessed the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the kraft and velveeta brands and recorded a noncash intangible asset impairment loss related to the kraft brand of approximately 124 billion which was recognized in sga 

the discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and our brands with 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand were as follows 



assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment therefore they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date additionally these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation however as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur as a sensitivity measure we have presented the estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates on the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount these estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline 

if we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2021 impairment testing date for each of these reporting units and brands these isolated changes which are reasonably possible to occur would have led to the following increasedecrease in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands in billions 



definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated periods benefited we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate currentperiod operating or cash flow losses significant declines in forecasted operations or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of definitelived intangible assets held for use we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on definitelived intangible assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

see note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our impairment testing results 

postemployment benefit plans 

we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on among other things the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses these net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses and amortized within other expenseincome in future periods using the corridor approach the corridor is 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation any actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive 

for our postretirement benefit plans our 2022 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 59 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 48 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2022 and 2030 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 

our 2022 discount rate assumption will be 30 for service cost and 22 for interest cost for our postretirement plans our 2022 discount rate assumption will be 32 for service cost and 26 for interest cost for our us pension plans and 24 for service cost and 18 for interest cost for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2022 expected return on plan assets will be 50 net of applicable taxes for our postretirement plans our 2022 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 46 for our us pension plans and 26 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2022 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basispoint change in our discount rate or a 100basispoint change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost in millions 



income taxes 

we compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with us gaap 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap we have presented organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps which are considered nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way these measures are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as net sales net incomeloss diluted eps or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

management uses these nongaap financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures ie organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices foreign exchange rates and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results we maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments the derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments see note 2 significant accounting policies  and note 13 financial instruments  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures 

when we use financial instruments we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement by policy we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

effect of hypothetical 10 fluctuation in market prices   

the potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts and crosscurrency swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates would have been in millions 



it should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items in relation to foreign currency contracts this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations debt repayments and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

effect of hypothetical 1 fluctuation in libor   

based on our current variable rate debt balance as of december 25 2021 a hypothetical 1 increase in libor would have an insignificant impact on our annual interest expense the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom will be phasing out the libor rates associated with our outstanding variable rate debt by the end of june 2023 given our current variable rate debt outstanding we do not anticipate a significant impact to our annual interest expense as a result of the transition

therefore effective in the first quarter of 2020 we manage and report our operating results through three reportable segments defined by geographic region united states international and canada we have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented 

see note 22 segment reporting  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our geographic financial information by segment 

covid19 pandemic 

in 2020 and continuing into 2021 the covid19 pandemic along with government and consumer responses to the pandemic caused and continue to cause uncertainty in the us and global economies the ongoing spread of covid19 throughout the united states and internationally and measures implemented by governmental authorities in an attempt to contain the virus including social distancing restrictions shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns have had and continue to have negative and positive implications for portions of our business during 2020 covid19 produced a beneficial impact on our consolidated net sales results as increased demand for our retail products more than offset declines in our foodservice or awayfromhome business we incurred additional covid19related operating costs as we focused on meeting increased retail demand adding additional sanitation measures and providing personal protective equipment to our employees while we expect volatility in the demand for our products to continue through the first quarter of 2021 and potentially beyond particularly as it relates to our foodservice business covid19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving and the longterm impacts to our financial condition and results of operations are still uncertain 

resources 

trademarks and intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2020 were 



  used under license 

we sell certain products under brands we license from third parties in 2020 brands used under licenses from third parties included capri sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the united states tgi fridays frozen snacks and appetizers in the united states and canada  mccafé ground whole bean and ondemand single cup coffees in the united states and taco bell home originals mexicanstyle food products in us grocery stores our license to use the mccafé brand expired in the united states in july 2020 and in canada in december 2019 in addition in our agreements with mondelēz international inc “mondelēz international” following the spinoff of kraft from mondelēz international in 2012 we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time 

we also own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

raw materials and packaging 

we manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat products and cocoa products to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and we use natural gas electricity and diesel fuel in the manufacturing and distribution of our products for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change pandemics consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade tariffs alternative energy and agricultural programs 

our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures 

research and development 

our research and development efforts focus on achieving the following four objectives 

• product innovations renovations and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs and drive growth 

• worldclass and uncompromising food safety quality and consistency 

• superior customerpreferred product and package performance and 

• continuous process improvement and product optimization in pursuit of cost reductions 

competition 

our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of ecommerce retailers largeformat retailers and discounters our competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers wholesalers and cooperatives we compete on the basis of product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

sales 

sales and customers 

our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers agents and distributors to chain wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies our products are also sold online through various ecommerce platforms and retailers our largest customer walmart inc represented approximately 22 of our net sales in 2020 and approximately 21 of our net sales in both 2019 and 2018 

additionally we have key customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers are individually significant to our consolidated business in 2020 the five largest customers in our united states segment accounted for approximately 50 of united states segment net sales the five largest customers in our international segment accounted for approximately 18 of international segment net sales and the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 76 of canada segment net sales 

we manage our sales portfolio through six consumerdriven product platforms a platform is a lens created for the portfolio based on a grouping of real consumer needs and includes the following for kraft heinz taste elevation fast fresh meals easy meals made better real food snacking flavorful hydration and easy indulgent desserts the platforms are modular and configurable by reportable segment and market further each platform is assigned a role within our business to help inform our resource allocation and investment decisions which are made at the reportable segment level these roles include grow energize and stabilize the role of a platform may also vary by reportable segment and market the platform approach helps us to manage our business efficiently including the oversight of our various product categories and brands and transforms the way we plan for our growth 

net sales by platform 

net sales by platform as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the periods presented were 



net sales by product category 

the product categories that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were 



seasonality 

although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis the majority of our products are produced throughout the year 

seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products including holidays changes in seasons or other annual events while these factors influence our quarterly net sales operating incomeloss and cash flows at the product level unless the timing of such events shift periodoverperiod eg a shift in easter timing this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results 

government regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated our business operations including the production transportation storage distribution sale display advertising marketing labeling quality and safety of our products and their ingredients and our occupational safety health and privacy practices are subject to various laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by federal state and local government agencies in the united states as well as government entities and agencies outside the united states in markets where our products are manufactured distributed or sold in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration us department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of the united states including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety health and safety anticorruption and data privacy in our business dealings we are also required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act and various other anticorruption regulations in the regions in which we operate we rely on legal and operational compliance programs as well as inhouse and outside counsel to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business in addition regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts 

environmental regulation 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters various laws concerning the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations 

in the united states where a significant portion of our business operates these laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions under similar legislation related to our current operations and certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability 

as of december 26 2020 we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves

 item 1a risk factors 

industry risks 

the rapidly changing and uncertain covid19 pandemic and government and consumer responses could negatively impact our business and results of operations 

the continuing spread of covid19 throughout the united states and internationally and measures implemented by governmental authorities in an attempt to contain the virus including social distancing restrictions shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns have had and could continue to have a negative impact on financial markets economic conditions and portions of our business although certain portions of our business have benefited the impact of and associated government and consumer responses to covid19 could negatively impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways which may be difficult to accurately estimate or forecast including but not limited to the following 

• a shutdown of one or more of our manufacturing facilities due to illness could significantly disrupt our production capabilities 

• a significant portion of our workforce could become unable to work including as a result of illness or government restrictions 

• a decrease in demand for awayfromhome establishments has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our foodservice operations 

• a change in demand resulting from restrictions on social interactions has affected and could continue to affect customers’ and consumers’ plans to purchase our products 

• a change in demand for or availability of our products as a result of retailers distributors or carriers modifying their restocking fulfillment or shipping practices 

• a shift in consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn could result in consumers moving to private label or lower margin products 

• a slowdown or stoppage in our supply chain or the failure of our suppliers vendors distributors or thirdparty manufacturers to meet their obligations to us or experience disruptions in their ability to do so 

• a strain on our supply chain could result from increased consumer demand at our retail customers such as grocery stores club stores and value stores 

• a change in trade promotion and marketing activities eg in response to changes in consumer viewing and shopping habits resulting from the cancellation of major events travel restrictions and instore shopping practices could adversely affect our current and future product sales 

• an impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets or a change in the useful life of definitelived intangible assets has occurred and may again occur if there are sustained changes in government restrictions consumer purchasing behaviors or our financial results particularly in our canada foodservice reporting unit as there may be a heightened risk of impairment if there is a sustained decrease in demand in awayfromhome establishments 

• a change in our fiveyear operating plan which could cause a change in the allocation of investments among our reporting units our growth expectations and our fair value estimates each of which could result in an impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets 

• an increase in working capital needs andor an increase in trade receivables writeoffs as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers 

• an increase in commodity and other input costs could result from market volatility 

• a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could result from market uncertainties 

• an increase in the cost of or our difficulty in obtaining debt or equity financing or to refinance our debt in the future could affect our financial condition or our ability to fund operations or future investment opportunities and 

• an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities including acquisitions and divestitures 

additionally covid19 could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as a portion of our workforce is required to work from home and therefore new processes procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment further should any key employees become ill from covid19 and unable to work the attention of the management team and resources could be diverted 

the potential effects of covid19 could also heighten the risks we face related to each of the risk factors disclosed below as covid19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving the potential impacts to these risk factors remain uncertain as a result covid19 may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products we compete based on product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including pressures related to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices these pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively assess timely change and properly set pricing promotions or trade incentives may negatively impact our ability to achieve our objectives 

the rapid emergence of new distribution channels particularly ecommerce may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may decline 

our success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovation 

consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we must distinguish between shortterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfies a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or platforms or if we do not rapidly develop products in fastergrowing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products including as they relate to obesity or other health concerns could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may continue to consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels these larger customers may seek to leverage their positions to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing more favorable terms increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding adverse effect on us which could be material for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets if we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers or in other business relationships could adversely impact us 

we derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers see sales and customers within item 1 business  some or all of our significant customers may not continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results in addition terminations of relationships with other significant contractual counterparties including licensors could adversely affect our portfolio product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition the financial condition of such customers suppliers and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers or suppliers or in other business relationships could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition across the globe our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation negative perceptions of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of our marketing practices moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us our quality and safety our environmental or social impacts our products becoming unavailable to consumers or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations furthermore existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation in addition we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts anticipate consumer preferences or invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation or brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as private label products which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive such a change if consumers prefer private label products then we could lose market share or sales volumes or our product mix could shift to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms increase our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories 

our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories or platforms as well as growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we have decided and could in the future decide to and have been or could in the future be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration product mislabeling or misbranding tampering undeclared allergens or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time 

we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued to conclusion the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

business risks 

we may not successfully identify complete or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures joint ventures or other investments 

from time to time we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates alliances joint ventures or other investments that may strategically fit our business objectives and we have divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states canada the european union the united kingdom and other jurisdictions we may be required to obtain approval of these transactions by competition authorities or to satisfy other legal requirements and we may be unable to obtain such approvals or satisfy such requirements each of which may result in additional costs time delays or our inability to complete such transactions 

to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances joint ventures investments or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the fcpa foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

to the extent we undertake divestitures we may face additional risks related to such activities for example risks related to our ability to find appropriate buyers execute transactions on favorable terms separate divested business operations with minimal impact to our remaining operations and effectively manage any transitional service arrangements further our divestiture activities have in the past required and may in the future require us to recognize impairment charges any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives 

we plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets consumer demands behaviors tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations additionally we may not successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives including achieving any previously announced productivity efficiencies and financial targets any new business may not be profitable or meet our expectations or any divestiture may not be completed without disruption any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

we are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets approximately 27 of our 2020 net sales were generated outside of the united states as a result we are subject to risks inherent in global operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include 

• compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states including antibribery laws such as the fcpa 

• changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications 

• the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or imports trade agreements regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales or costs 

• foreign currency devaluations or fluctuations in foreign currency values 

• compliance with antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions 

• discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictions 

• changes in capital controls including foreign currency exchange controls governmental foreign currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the united states 

• challenges associated with crossborder product distribution 

• changes in local regulations and laws the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources 

• risks and costs associated with political and economic instability corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate 

• the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights 

• risks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in foreign currency exchange markets and the decisions made and positions taken to hedge such volatility 

• changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations 

• greater risk of uncollectible accounts or trade receivables and longer collection cycles and 

• design implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base 

slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets trade dress copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to develop or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition we also license certain intellectual property most notably trademarks from third parties to the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future 

as of december 26 2020 the sponsors own approximately 44 of our common stock three of 11 members of our board are partners andor board members of 3g capital and two members of our board are officers andor directors of berkshire hathaway andor its affiliates in addition paulo basilio our global chief financial officer is a partner of 3g capital as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over board decisions including those affecting our capital structure such as the issuance of additional capital stock the incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the declaration and amount of dividends the sponsors also have substantial control over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors were to collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take stockholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock furthermore the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness 

we have implemented a number of initiatives including development of an operations center and strategic longterm collaboration with suppliers that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure and operations to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any costsaving efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production profitability financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

our level of indebtedness as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt our existing debt together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences including but not limited to 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures research and development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes 

• resulting in a downgrade to our credit rating which could adversely affect our cost of funds including our commercial paper programs liquidity and access to capital markets 

• restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

• limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged 

• making it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness 

• requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations payments of dividends capital expenditures and future business opportunities 

• exposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of foreign currencies and the majority of our debt is denominated in us dollars and 

• in the case of any additional indebtedness exacerbating the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage 

in addition we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future debt or equity financings may not be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our indebtedness instruments contain customary representations warranties and covenants including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “senior credit facility” to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses the creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines or if we are unable to comply with any covenant such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the sec we have in the past needed and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default 

if we breach any covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors or we may not be able to remedy compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments and unable to access our senior credit facility in addition certain creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

additional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 26 2020 we maintain 15 reporting units nine of which comprise our goodwill balance our indefinitelived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands  we test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes disposals of significant brands or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster pandemic or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate or changes in management strategy we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions these assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates royalty rates contributory asset charges and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates income tax rates foreign currency exchange rates or any factors that could be affected by covid19 change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including updates to our longterm operating plans then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth additionally any decisions to divest certain nonstrategic assets could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units or brands in the future 

as a result of our annual and interim impairment tests we recognized goodwill impairment losses of 23 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 11 billion in 2020 goodwill impairment losses of 12 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 702 million in 2019 and goodwill impairment losses of 70 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 89 billion in 2018 our reporting units and brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates accordingly these and other reporting units and brands that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future reporting units with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 75 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included meal foundations and coffee “mfc” canada retail canada foodservice and puerto rico reporting units with between 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 125 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included kids snacks and beverages “ksb” and northern europe reporting units with between 2050 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 125 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included enhancers specialty and away from home “esa” and continental europe the asia reporting unit had a fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50 and a goodwill carrying amount of 326 million as of its latest 2020 impairment testing date brands with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of 218 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included kraft  oscar mayer  velveeta  miracle whip  planters  maxwell house  cool whip  classico  abc  plasmon  and wattie’s each of these brands had a fair value over carrying amount of less than 1 due to impairments recorded in the current and recent prior years brands with 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of 41 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included lunchables  a1  oreida  stove top  jet puffed  and quero  the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 66 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date although the remaining brands with a carrying value of 93 billion have more than 50 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date these amounts are also associated with the acquisition of h j heinz company by the sponsors in 2013 and the 2015 merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values therefore if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future these amounts are also susceptible to impairments 

our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

we derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah chinese renminbi and indian rupee since our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented foreign currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 

commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat products cocoa products cucumbers onions other fruits and vegetables spices and flour to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals cardboard glass plastic paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as natural gas electricity and water to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources foreign currency fluctuations severe weather natural disasters global climate change health pandemics crop failures crop shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade tariffs alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations furthermore the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer pressures if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income 

we use commodity futures options and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products meat products coffee beans sugar vegetable oils wheat products corn products cocoa products packaging products diesel fuel and natural gas we recognize gains and losses based on changes in the values of these commodity derivatives we recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we recognize the unrealized gains and losses on these commodity derivatives in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results accordingly changes in the values of our commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income 

regulatory risks 

compliance with laws regulations and related interpretations and related legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could impact our business and we face additional risks and uncertainties related to any potential actions resulting from the sec’s ongoing investigation as well as potential additional subpoenas litigation and regulatory proceedings 

as a large global food and beverage company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks various laws and regulations govern production storage distribution sales advertising labeling including onpack claims information or disclosures marketing licensing trade labor tax environmental matters privacy and health and safety and data protection practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations as a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate we are faced with a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions 

as previously disclosed on february 21 2019 we received a subpoena in october 2018 from the sec related to our procurement area specifically the accounting policies procedures and internal controls related to our procurement function including but not limited to agreements side agreements and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers following the receipt of this subpoena we together with external counsel and forensic accountants and subsequently under the oversight of the audit committee conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters the sec has issued additional subpoenas seeking information related to our financial reporting incentive plans debt issuances internal controls disclosures personnel our assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments our communications with certain stockholders and other related information and materials in connection with its investigation the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of illinois “usao” is also reviewing this matter the kraft heinz company and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit a class action lawsuit brought under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” a consolidated stockholder derivative action pending in federal court and a consolidated stockholder derivative action pending in the delaware court of chancery 

we are cooperating with the sec and usao and intend to vigorously defend the civil lawsuits we are unable at this time to estimate our potential liability in these matters in connection with the securities and erisa class action lawsuits and the stockholder derivative actions we may be required to pay judgments settlements or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses see item 3 legal proceedings  and note 17 commitments and contingencies  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information 

in connection with the sec and usao investigations we could be required to pay significant civil or criminal penalties and become subject to injunctions cease and desist orders and other equitable remedies the sec and usao investigations have not been resolved as of the filing of this annual report on form 10k we can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory investigation 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses related to legal accounting and other professional services in connection with the internal investigation the sec investigation and related legal and regulatory matters these expenses have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and cash flows 

as a result of matters associated with the internal investigation related to the sec investigation and various lawsuits we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results which could negatively impact our business investor confidence and the price of our common stock 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 28 2019 we identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control over financial reporting as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of misstatement due to changes in our business environment this material weakness resulted in misstatements that were corrected in the restatement included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 29 2018 this material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to a material weakness arising from supplier contracts and related arrangements we completed remediation measures related to the material weaknesses and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 27 2020 completion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly or remain adequate 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected which could subject us to litigation investigations or penalties negatively affect our liquidity our access to capital markets perceptions of our creditworthiness our ability to complete acquisitions our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports or investor confidence in our financial reporting or cause defaults accelerations or crossaccelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or to cure any breaches any of which may require management resources or cause our stock price to decline 

a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings 

our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm credit ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these credit ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in february 2020 moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” affirmed our longterm credit rating of baa3 with a negative outlook and fitch ratings “fitch” and sp global ratings “sp” downgraded our longterm credit rating from bbb to bb with a stable outlook from fitch and a negative outlook from sp the downgrades by fitch and sp reduce our senior debt below investment grade potentially resulting in higher borrowing costs on future financings and limiting access to our commercial paper program and other sources of funding which may result in us having to use more expensive sources of liquidity such as our senior credit facility these downgrades do not constitute a default or event of default under our debt instruments as of the date of this filing we maintain a positive outlook from fitch and a stable outlook from moody’s and sp 

registered securities risks 

sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market sales of our common stock by the sponsors or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities a sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened which was a contributing factor to our decision to perform interim impairment tests for certain reporting units and brands in 2018 and 2019 for which we ultimately recorded impairment losses and could in the future happen which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets which could increase the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

kraft heinz 3g global food holdings and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g global food holdings and berkshire hathaway which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of december 26 2020 registrable shares represented approximately 44 of all outstanding shares of our common stock although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a “lockup” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly offers and sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement sales of our common stock by the sponsors to other persons would likely result in an increase in the number of shares being traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our stockholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the board and may be limited by our financial condition debt agreements or limitations under delaware law 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof will be at the discretion of the board and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law debt agreements and other factors the board deems relevant the board has previously decided and may in the future decide in its sole discretion to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons stockholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

general risk factors 

unanticipated business disruptions and natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers distributors or regulators operate could adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers or our results of operations 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned and leased manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather or other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis raw material shortages natural disasters fires or explosions political unrest geopolitical conflicts terrorism civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation generalized labor unrest or health pandemics such as covid19 could damage or disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers comanufacturers distributors or regulators these factors include but are not limited to 

• natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ or distributors’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products and 

• influenza or other pandemics such as covid19 could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the awayfromhome or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations 

these or other disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network while we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to manage business continuity planning such insurance may not compensate us for any losses incurred and our business continuity plans may not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner to the extent we are unable to respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems or to financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage them if they occur we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers or to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do business 

our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets changes to major international trade arrangements and the imposition of tariffs by certain foreign governments could negatively impact our operations and sales though the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” on january 31 2020 some uncertainties remain around the current and future impacts of the provisional trade agreement signed on december 24 2020 as a result we continue to evaluate the risks associated with brexit including the potential for supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility other factors impacting our operations in the united states and in international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest certain of these factors may be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of or related to the recent change in the us presidential administration such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions and our responses to them could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results for further information on venezuela see note 15 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we rely on our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel and a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business unplanned turnover failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions including the chief executive officer position could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees any such loss failure or limitation could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyberattacks and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions reputational damage transaction errors processing inefficiencies the leakage of confidential information and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations damage to our reputation and credibility loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of our ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or consumers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving and developing regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data such laws and regulations as well as their interpretation and application may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction which can result in inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 adds a broad array of requirements with respect to personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective in january 2020 among other things imposes additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of california residents the ccpa provides civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches gdpr ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of noncompliance which could result in substantial penalties 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements 

furthermore we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with unionrepresented employees both in and outside of the united states 

changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed additionally the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate a number of factors influence our effective tax rate including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules federal state and local governments and administrative bodies within the united states which represents the majority of our operations and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented or are considering a variety of broad tax trade and other regulatory reforms that may impact us moreover the recent change in the us presidential administration may increase the likelihood of changes to the us federal income tax laws in addition changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit sharing “beps” could impact our effective tax rate it is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes but these changes could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 

significant judgment knowledge and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in geographic mix of income increases in expenses not deductible for tax including impairment of goodwill and changes in available tax credits in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult the results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt our us dollar variable rate debt uses libor as a benchmark for determining interest rates and the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom intends to phase out the libor rates associated with our outstanding variable rate debt by the end of june 2023 while we do not expect that the transition from libor including any legal or regulatory changes made in response to its future phase out or the risks related to its discontinuance will have a material effect on our financing costs the impact is uncertain at this time 

some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable increasing our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

description of the company 

we manufacture and market food and beverage products including condiments and sauces cheese and dairy meals meats refreshment beverages coffee and other grocery products throughout the world 

in the first quarter of 2020 our internal reporting and reportable segments changed we moved our puerto rico business from the latin america zone to the united states zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain we also combined our emea latin america and apac zones to form the international zone as a result of certain previously announced organizational changes 

therefore effective in the first quarter of 2020 we manage and report our operating results through three reportable segments defined by geographic region united states international and canada we have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented 

see note 22 segment reporting  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our financial information by segment

items affecting comparability of financial results 

impairment losses 

our results of operations reflect goodwill impairment losses of 23 billion and intangible asset impairment losses of 11 billion in 2020 compared to goodwill impairment losses of 12 billion and intangible asset impairment losses of 702 million in 2019 see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  and note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on these impairment losses 

covid19 impacts 

we have been actively monitoring the impact of covid19 on our business in 2020 we experienced consolidated net sales growth compared to the prior year as higher demand for our retail products more than offset declines in our foodservice business this increased demand for our retail products could reverse in the future if consumer purchasing behavior changes we expect volatility in the demand for awayfromhome establishments to continue through the first quarter of 2021 and potentially beyond which is expected to negatively impact our foodservice business however covid19 and its impacts are unprecedented and continuously evolving and the longterm impacts to our financial condition and results of operations are still uncertain

net incomeloss 



a adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure see the nongaap financial measures section at the end of this item 

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

operating incomeloss decreased 307 to income of 21 billion in 2020 compared to 31 billion in 2019 primarily driven by higher noncash impairment losses in the current year noncash impairment losses were 34 billion in 2020 compared to 19 billion in 2019 the remaining change in operating incomeloss was an increase of 572 million primarily driven by higher organic net sales in the current year which more than offset increased variable compensation expenses higher equity award compensation expense investments in marketing higher supply chain costs higher general corporate expenses unfavorable changes in key commodity costs which we define as dairy meat coffee and nuts and the unfavorable impact of divestitures see note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our noncash impairment losses 

net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders decreased 816 to income of 356 million in 2020 compared to 19 billion in 2019 this change was driven by the operating incomeloss factors described above primarily higher noncash impairment losses in the current year unfavorable changes in other expenseincome and higher interest expense partially offset by lower tax expense in the current year 

• other expenseincome was 296 million of income in 2020 compared to 952 million of income in 2019 this change was primarily driven by a 2 million net loss on sales of businesses in 2020 compared to a 420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 a 184 million decrease in noncash amortization of prior service credits as compared to the prior year period a 162 million net foreign exchange loss in 2020 compared to a 10 million net foreign exchange loss in 2019 and a 26 million loss on the dissolution of a joint venture these impacts were partially offset by a 154 million net gain on derivative activities in 2020 compared to a 33 million net gain on derivative activities in 2019 as we estimate the amortization of prior service credits to be insignificant in 2021 we are forecasting a negative impact to other expenseincome in 2021 compared to 2020 of approximately 114 million  

• interest expense was 14 billion in 2020 compared to 14 billion in 2019 our 2020 interest expense included a 124 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in connection with our tender offer and debt redemptions in 2020 as well as 22 million of interest expense related to the 40 billion drawn on our senior credit facility in the first quarter of 2020 and repaid by the end of the second quarter of 2020 our 2019 interest expense included a 98 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in connection with our tender offers and debt redemptions in 2019 

• our effective tax rate was 650 in 2020 compared to 274 in 2019 our 2020 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items primarily related to nondeductible goodwill impairments the impact of the federal tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” and the revaluation of our deferred tax balances due to changes in international tax laws these impacts were partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pretax income in various nonus jurisdictions and the favorable impact of establishing certain deferred tax assets for state tax deductions our 2019 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by rate reconciling items primarily related to nondeductible goodwill impairments the impact of the federal tax on gilti an increase in uncertain tax position reserves the establishment of certain state valuation allowance reserves and the tax impacts from the sale of heinz india private limited “heinz india transaction” and the sale of certain assets in our natural cheese business in canada “canada natural cheese transaction” these impacts were partially offset by the reversal of certain withholding tax obligations and changes in estimates of certain 2018 us income and deductions 

adjusted ebitda increased 100 to 67 billion in 2020 compared to 61 billion in 2019 despite the unfavorable impacts of divestitures 10 pp and foreign currency 05 pp as increases in the united states and international segments more than offset declines in canada and higher general corporate expenses adjusted ebitda growth was primarily driven by the continued growth of athome consumption due in part to the covid19 pandemic 

diluted eps 



a   adjusted eps is a nongaap financial measure see the nongaap financial measures section at the end of this item 

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

diluted eps decreased 816 to 029 in 2020 compared to 158 in 2019 primarily driven by the net incomeloss attributable to common shareholders factors discussed above 



a adjusted eps is a nongaap financial measure see the nongaap financial measures section at the end of this item 

adjusted eps increased 11 to 288 in 2020 compared to 285 in 2019 primarily due to higher adjusted ebitda which more than offset unfavorable changes in other expenseincome higher taxes on adjusted earnings in the current period and higher equity award compensation expense unfavorable changes in other expenseincome were primarily due to lower noncash amortization of prior service credits in the current year 

results of operations by segment 

management evaluates segment performance based on several factors including net sales organic net sales and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome provision forbenefit from income taxes and depreciation and amortization excluding integration and restructuring expenses in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses deal costs unrealized gainslosses on commodity hedges the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results impairment losses and equity award compensation expense excluding integration and restructuring expenses segment adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net incomeloss rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary the exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are recorded in current net incomeloss and are classified within other expenseincome as nonmonetary currency devaluation see note 15 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation  and note 2 significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information

net sales increased 17 to 53 billion in 2020 compared to 53 billion in 2019 despite the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency 27 pp including 05 pp from the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and divestitures 03 pp organic net sales increased 47 to 55 billion in 2020 compared to 52 billion in 2019 driven by the continued growth of athome consumption due in part to the covid19 pandemic organic net sales growth was driven by favorable volumemix 26 pp and higher pricing 21 pp favorable volumemix was primarily driven by consumptionled growth in condiments and sauces and boxed dinners which more than offset a significant decline in foodservicerelated sales and to a lesser extent infant nutrition shipments higher pricing was primarily driven by increases in latin america australia and the united kingdom 

segment adjusted ebitda increased 54 to 11 billion in 2020 compared to 10 billion in 2019 this increase was primarily driven by the continued growth of athome consumption due in part to the covid19 pandemic as organic net sales growth more than offset higher supply chain costs increased variable compensation expenses and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency 24 pp including 14 pp from the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar

fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 

net sales decreased 128 to 16 billion in 2020 compared to 19 billion in 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of divestitures 116 pp and foreign currency 11 pp organic net sales decreased 01 to 17 billion in 2020 compared to 17 billion in 2019 primarily due to unfavorable volumemix 23 pp which more than offset higher pricing 22 pp unfavorable volumemix was primarily due to lower foodservicerelated sales and the negative impact from exiting the mccafé licensing agreement which more than offset the continued growth of athome consumption due in part to the covid19 pandemic pricing was higher primarily driven by price increases in cheese 

segment adjusted ebitda decreased 202 to 389 million in 2020 compared to 487 million in 2019 despite the continued growth of athome consumption due in part to the covid19 pandemic segment adjusted ebitda decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact of divestitures 106 pp higher supply chain costs the negative impact from exiting the mccafé licensing agreement as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency 10 pp which more than offset pricing gains compared to the prior year period 

critical accounting estimates 

note 2 significant accounting policies  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products we recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers we record revenues net of variable consideration including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions excluding taxes and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs we also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors we recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year 

advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates performancebased instore display activities and volumebased incentives variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization redemption rates andor current period experience factors we review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information 

advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information we recorded advertising expenses of 646 million in 2020 534 million in 2019 and 584 million in 2018 which represented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television radio print digital and social channels we also incur other advertising and marketing costs such as shopper marketing sponsorships and agency advertisement conception design and public relations fees total advertising and marketing costs were 12 billion in 2020 and 11 billion in both 2019 and 2018 

goodwill and intangible assets 

as of december 26 2020 we maintain 15 reporting units nine of which comprise our goodwill balance these nine reporting units had an aggregate carrying amount of 331 billion as of december 26 2020 our indefinitelived intangible asset balance 

primarily consists of a number of individual brands which had an aggregate carrying amount of 423 billion as of december 26 2020 

we test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes disposals of significant brands or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster pandemic or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate or changes in management strategy we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions these assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates royalty rates contributory asset charges and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates income tax rates foreign currency exchange rates or any factors that could be affected by covid19 change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including updates to our longterm operating plans then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future additionally any decisions to divest certain nonstrategic assets could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units or brands in the future 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic produced a shortterm beneficial financial impact for our consolidated results retail sales increased due to higher than anticipated consumer demand for our products the foodservice channel however experienced a negative impact from prolonged social distancing mandates limiting access to and capacity at awayfromhome establishments for a longer period of time than was expected when they were originally put in place our esa and canada foodservice reporting units are the most exposed of our reporting units to the longterm impacts to awayfromhome establishments our us foodservice now included within esa and canada foodservice reporting units were both impaired during our most recent annual impairment test reflecting our best estimate at that time of the future outlook and risks of these businesses the esa and canada foodservice reporting units maintain an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of approximately 117 billion as of december 26 2020 a number of factors could result in further future impairments of our foodservice businesses including but not limited to continued mandates around closures of dining rooms in restaurants distancing of people within establishments resulting in fewer customers the total number of restaurant closures forthcoming changes in consumer preferences or regulatory requirements over product formats eg table top packaging vs single serve packaging and consumer trends of diningin versus diningout given the evolving nature of and uncertainty driven by the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the impact on our reporting units as adverse changes to these assumptions could result in future impairments 

as we consider the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic with regard to our indefinitelived intangible assets a number of factors could have a future adverse impact on our brands including changes in consumer and consumption trends in both the short and long term the extent of continued government mandates to shelter in place total number of restaurant closures economic declines and reductions in consumer discretionary income we have seen an increase in our retail business in the shortterm that has more than offset declines in our foodservice business over the same period our brands are generally common across both the retail and foodservice businesses and the fair value of our brands are subject to a similar mix of positive and negative factors given the evolving nature and uncertainty driven by covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate the impact on our brands 

as detailed in note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we recorded impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our reporting units and brands that were impaired were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates accordingly these and other reporting units and brands that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future 

reporting units with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 75 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included mfc canada retail canada foodservice and puerto rico reporting units with between 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 125 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included ksb and northern europe reporting units with between 2050 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 125 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included esa and continental europe the asia reporting unit had a fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50 and a goodwill carrying amount of 326 million as of its latest 2020 impairment testing date brands with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of 218 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included kraft  oscar mayer  velveeta  miracle whip  planters  maxwell house  cool whip  classico  abc  plasmon  and wattie’s each of these brands had a fair value over carrying amount of less than 1 due to impairments recorded in the current and recent prior years brands with 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of 41 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date and included lunchables  a1  oreida  stove top  jet puffed  and quero  the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 66 billion as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date although the remaining brands with an aggregate carrying amount of 93 billion have more than 50 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2020 impairment testing date these amounts are also associated with the acquisition of h j heinz company by the sponsors in 2013 and the 2015 merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values therefore if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future these amounts are also susceptible to impairments 

we generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit including net sales cost of products sold sga depreciation and amortization working capital and capital expenditures income tax rates longterm growth rates and a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

we utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand including net sales cost of products sold and sga contributory asset charges income tax considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

we utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand royalty rates as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee income tax considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

as detailed in note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  in the third quarter of 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of groupe lactalis “lactalis” to sell certain assets in our global cheese business as well as to license certain trademarks for total consideration of approximately 33 billion the “cheese transaction” the total consideration includes approximately 15 billion attributed to the kraft and velveeta licenses that we will grant to lactalis and approximately 75 million attributed to the cracker barrel license that lactalis will grant to us the amounts of which were based on the estimated fair values of the licensed portion of each brand we utilized the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the licensed portion of the kraft brand and the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the licensed portions of the velveeta brand and the cracker barrel brand some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating these fair values include the estimated future annual net sales and net cash flows for each brand contributory asset charges royalty rates as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee income tax considerations longterm growth rates and a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to each brand we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates and guideline companies as of december 26 2020 we assessed the fair value less costs to sell of the net assets to be transferred to lactalis and determined that their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying amount 

at the time the licensed rights are granted we will reassess the remaining fair value of the retained portions of the kraft and velveeta brands and may record a charge to reduce the intangible asset carrying amounts to reflect the lower future cash flows expected to be generated after monetization of the licensed portion of each brand any potential reduction to the intangible asset carrying amounts will depend upon the excess fair value if any over carrying amount for each brand at the time we grant the perpetual licenses which will be on the closing date of the cheese transaction changes in the fair value of the retained and licensed portions of each brand will impact the amount of any potential charges and the amount of license income that will be recognized which at this time we would not expect to exceed the fair value of the perpetual licenses 

the discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and our brands with 10 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts as of the latest 2020 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand were as follows 



the discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and our brands with 1020 excess fair value over carry amount as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts as of the latest 2020 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand were as follows 



assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment therefore they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date additionally these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation however as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur as a sensitivity measure we have presented the estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates on the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 10 or less excess fair value over carrying amount and 1020 excess fair value over carrying amount these estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline 

if we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and our brands with 10 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the latest 2020 impairment testing date for each of these reporting units and brands these isolated changes which are reasonably possible to occur would have led to the following increasedecrease in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands in billions 



if we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and our brands with 1020 excess fair value over carrying amount as of the latest 2020 impairment testing date for each of these reporting units and brands these isolated changes which are reasonably possible to occur would have led to the following increasedecrease in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands in billions 



definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated periods benefited we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate currentperiod operating or cash flow losses significant declines in forecasted operations or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of definitelived intangible assets held for use we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on definitelived intangible assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

see note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our impairment testing results 

postemployment benefit plans 

we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on among other things the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses these net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses and amortized within other expenseincome in future periods using the corridor approach the corridor is 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation any actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive 

for our postretirement benefit plans our 2021 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 62 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 48 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2021 and 2030 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 

our 2021 discount rate assumption will be 27 for service cost and 16 for interest cost for our postretirement plans our 2021 discount rate assumption will be 30 for service cost and 21 for interest cost for our us pension plans and 21 for service cost and 12 for interest cost for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2021 expected return on plan assets will be 44 net of applicable taxes for our postretirement plans our 2021 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 41 for our us pension plans and 31 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2021 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basispoint change in our discount rate or a 100basispoint change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost in millions 



income taxes 

we compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat products and cocoa products to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and we use natural gas electricity and diesel fuel in the manufacturing and distribution of our products we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities 

we define our key commodities in the united states and canada as dairy meat coffee and nuts in 2020 we experienced cost increases for dairy and meat while costs for nuts and coffee decreased we manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies as a result of these risk management strategies our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends 

dairy commodities primarily milk and cheese are the most significant cost components of our cheese products we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components of our meat products include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on global markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and global markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of prices 

liquidity and capital resources 

in february 2020 fitch and sp downgraded our longterm credit rating from bbb to bb these downgrades adversely affect our ability to access the commercial paper market in addition we could experience an increase in interest costs as a result of the downgrades these downgrades do not constitute a default or event of default under any of our debt instruments limitations on or elimination of our ability to access the commercial paper program may require us to borrow under the senior credit facility if necessary to meet liquidity needs our ability to borrow under the senior credit facility is not affected by the downgrades as of the date of this filing our longterm debt is rated bb by both fitch and sp and baa3 by moody’s with a positive outlook from fitch and a stable outlook from moody’s and sp 

on march 12 2020 we provided notice to our lenders to borrow the full available amount under our senior credit facility so that a total of 40 billion was drawn in the first quarter of 2020 this action was a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility in light of the uncertainty in the global economy resulting from the covid19 pandemic we repaid the full 40 billion revolver draw during the second quarter of 2020 

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities and senior credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs repayments of longterm debt future contractual obligations payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends planned capital expenditures restructuring expenditures and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans for the next 12 months an additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets we intend to use our cash on hand for daily funding requirements 

cash flow activity for 2020 compared to 2019 

net cash provided byused for operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 49 billion for the year ended december 26 2020 compared to 36 billion for the year ended december 28 2019 this increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted ebitda and favorable changes in accounts payable and other current liabilities largely due to the timing of payments 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 522 million for the year ended december 26 2020 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 15 billion for the year ended december 28 2019 this change was primarily driven by proceeds from our canada natural cheese transaction and heinz india transaction received in 2019 and lower proceeds from our net investment hedges in 2020 compared to 2019 partially offset by cash paid to acquire primal nutrition llc in 2019 and lower capital expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019 we expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately 900 million however given the covid19 pandemic our estimates of capital expenditures are subject to change see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on the canada natural cheese transaction heinz india transaction and the acquisition of primal nutrition llc 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 33 billion for the year ended december 26 2020 compared to 39 billion for the year ended december 28 2019 this decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds received from longterm debt issuances and lower repayments of longterm debt in 2020 compared to 2019 see note 18 debt  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our longterm debt issuances and debt repayments 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

of the 34 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at december 26 2020 910 million was held by international subsidiaries 

subsequent to january 1 2018 we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested for those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our us cash requirements the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities 

for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our 2018 2019 and 2020 accumulated earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately 20 million 

our undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through december 30 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested as of december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 we had recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 20 million on approximately 300 million of historic earnings related to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed 

trade payables programs 

in order to manage our cash flow and related liquidity we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable generally range from 0 to 200 days we also maintain agreements with third party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us and at the sole discretion of the supplier sell one or more of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary we estimate that the amounts outstanding under these programs were 740 million at december 26 2020 and 370 million at december 28 2019 

borrowing arrangements 

we have historically obtained funding through our us and european commercial paper programs we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 26 2020 at december 28 2019 or during the year ended december 26 2020 the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year ended december 28 2019 was 200 million 

we maintain our senior credit facility which following the execution of the commitment increase amendment on october 9 2020 provides aggregate commitments of 41 billion through july 6 2023 and 40 billion through july 6 2024 subject to certain conditions we may increase the amount of revolving commitments andor add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to 900 million 40 billion was drawn on our senior credit facility during the first quarter of 2020 we repaid the full 40 billion revolver draw during the second quarter of 2020 no amounts were drawn on our senior credit facility at december 26 2020 at december 28 2019 or during the years ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 

the senior credit facility contains representations warranties and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could upon the occurrence of certain events of default restrict our ability to access our senior credit facility we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 26 2020 

longterm debt 

our longterm debt including the current portion was 283 billion at december 26 2020 and 292 billion at december 28 2019 this decrease was primarily related to the 21 billion aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes that were validly tendered in may 2020 the 13 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes redeemed in june 2020 the 302 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes redeemed in october 2020 the 405 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were repaid at maturity in february 2020 and the 200 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and 500 million canadian dollars aggregate principal amount of senior notes that we repaid at maturity in july 2020 these decreases to longterm debt were partially offset by the 35 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in may 2020 we used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes to fund our tender offers in may 2020 and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and to fund our debt redemptions in june 2020 we used cash on hand to fund our debt redemption in october 2020 

as a result of the senior notes issued in may 2020 and the settlement of our tender offers in may 2020 and our debt redemptions in june 2020 we extinguished aggregate principal amounts of senior notes of approximately 539 million that were due to mature in february 2021 and approximately 300 million that were due to mature in june 2021 

we repaid approximately 111 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes on february 10 2021 we have aggregate principal amount of senior notes of approximately 34 million maturing in september 2021 we expect to fund these longterm debt repayments primarily with cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities 

in september 2020 we entered into the cheese transaction for total consideration of approximately 33 billion including approximately 32 billion of cash consideration the cheese transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals we expect to use posttax transaction proceeds primarily to repay longterm debt see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on the cheese transaction 

our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 26 2020

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 26 2020 in millions 



a amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt including interest on variable and fixed rate longterm debt interest on variable rate longterm debt is calculated based on interest rates at december 26 2020 

b amounts represent the expected cash payments of our finance leases including expected cash payments of interest expense 

c operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases net of sublease income 

d we have purchase obligations for materials supplies property plant and equipment and copacking storage and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction several of these obligations are longterm and are based on minimum purchase requirements certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations we do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations we exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above 

e other longterm liabilities primarily consist of estimated payments for the onetime toll charge related to us tax reform as well as postretirement benefit commitments certain other longterm liabilities related to income taxes insurance accruals and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items 

pension plan contributions were 15 million in 2020 we estimate that 2021 pension plan contributions will be approximately 14 million estimated future contributions take into consideration current economic conditions including the impacts of covid19 which at this time are expected to have minimal impact on expected contributions for 2021 beyond 2021 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated pension plan contributions for 2021 have been excluded from the above table 

postretirement benefit plan contributions were 12 million in 2020 we estimate that 2021 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately 14 million estimated future contributions take into consideration current economic conditions including the impacts of covid19 which at this time are expected to have minimal impact on expected contributions for 2021 beyond 2021 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated postretirement benefit plan contributions for 2021 have been excluded from the above table 

at december 26 2020 the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 491 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table 

equity and dividends 

we paid common stock dividends of 20 billion in both 2020 and 2019 and 32 billion in 2018 additionally on february 11 2021 our board declared a cash dividend of 040 per share of common stock which is payable on march 26 2021 to shareholders of record on march 12 2021 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with us gaap 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap we have presented organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps which are considered nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way these measures are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as net sales net incomeloss diluted earnings per share “eps” or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

management uses these nongaap financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures ie organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures 

organic net sales is defined as net sales excluding when they occur the impact of currency acquisitions and divestitures and a 53rd week of shipments we calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate organic net sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome provision forbenefit from income taxes and depreciation and amortization excluding integration and restructuring expenses in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses deal costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses and equity award compensation expense excluding integration and restructuring expenses adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps excluding when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses deal costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses lossesgains on the sale of a business other lossesgains related to acquisitions and divestitures eg tax and hedging impacts nonmonetary currency devaluation eg remeasurement gains and losses debt prepayment and extinguishment costs and us tax reform discrete income tax expensebenefit and including when they occur adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis we believe adjusted eps provides important comparability of underlying operating results allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices foreign exchange rates and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results we maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments the derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments see note 2 significant accounting policies  and note 13 financial instruments  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures 

when we use financial instruments we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement by policy we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

effect of hypothetical 10 fluctuation in market prices   

the potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts and crosscurrency swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates would have been in millions 



it should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items in relation to foreign currency contracts this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations debt repayments and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

effect of hypothetical 1 fluctuation in libor   

based on our current variable rate debt balance as of december 26 2020 a hypothetical 1 increase in libor would have an insignificant impact on our annual interest expense the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom will be phasing out the libor rates associated with our outstanding variable rate debt by the end of june 2023 given our current variable rate debt outstanding we do not anticipate a significant impact to our annual interest expense as a result of the transition

see note 22 segment reporting  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our geographic financial information by segment 

trademarks and intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2019 were 



used under license additionally our license to use the mccafe brand expired in canada in december 2019 

we sell certain products under brands we license from third parties in 2019 brands used under licenses from third parties included capri sun packaged drink pouches for sale in the united states tgi fridays frozen snacks and appetizers in the united states and canada  mccafe ground whole bean and ondemand single cup coffees in the united states and canada  and taco bell home originals mexicanstyle food products in us grocery stores in addition in our agreements with mondelēz international inc “mondelēz international” following the spinoff of kraft from mondelēz international in 2012 we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time 

we also own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

research and development 

our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives 

 competition 

our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of ecommerce retailers largeformat retailers and discounters competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers wholesalers and cooperatives we compete on the basis of product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

sales and customers 

our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers agents and distributors to chain wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies our products are also sold online through various ecommerce platforms and retailers our largest customer walmart inc represented approximately 21 of our net sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 

additionally we have significant customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers are individually material to our consolidated business in 2019 the five largest customers in our us segment accounted for approximately 48 of us segment net sales the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 73 of canada segment net sales and the five largest customers in our emea segment accounted for approximately 26 of our emea segment net sales 

net sales by product category 

the product categories that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were 



raw materials and packaging 

we manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products and wheat products to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status and have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade tariffs alternative energy and agricultural programs 

our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures 

seasonality and working capital 

although crops constituting certain of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis the majority of our products are produced throughout the year 

seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products including holidays changes in seasons or other annual events while these factors influence our quarterly net sales operating incomeloss and cash flows at the product level unless the timing of such events shift periodoverperiod eg a shift in easter timing this seasonality does not typically have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or segment results 

for information related to our cash flows provided byused for operating activities including working capital items see liquidity and capital resources in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 

employees 

we had approximately 37000 employees as of december 28 2019  

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated our business operations including the production transportation storage distribution sale display advertising marketing labeling quality and safety of our products and their ingredients and our occupational safety health and privacy practices are subject to various laws and regulations these laws and regulations are administered by federal state and local government agencies in the united states as well as government entities and agencies outside the united states in markets where our products are manufactured distributed or sold in the united states our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration us department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of the united states including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety health and safety anticorruption and data privacy in our business dealings we are also required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act and various other anticorruption regulations in the regions in which we operate we rely on legal and operational compliance programs as well as inhouse and outside counsel to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business in addition the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and other regulatory regime changes may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts 

environmental regulation 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight regarding environmental matters various laws concerning the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations 

in the united states where a significant portion of our business operates these laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions under similar legislation related to our current operations and certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability 

as of december 28 2019  we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves

 item 1a risk factors 

industry risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products we compete based on product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including pressures in relation to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices these pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively assess timely change and set proper pricing promotions or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives 

the rapid emergence of new distribution channels particularly ecommerce may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may decline 

our success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovation 

consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually and rapidly our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we must distinguish between shortterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in fastergrowing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products including as they relate to obesity or other health concerns could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may continue to consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their positions to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing more favorable terms increased promotional programs or specificallytailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets if we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in our relationships with significant customers suppliers or other business relationships could adversely impact us 

we derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers see sales and customers within item 1 business  there can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results in addition terminations of relationships with other significant contractual counterparties including licensors could adversely affect our portfolio product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition the financial condition of such customers suppliers and other significant contractual counterparties are affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control significant deteriorations in the financial conditions of significant customers suppliers and other business relationships could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition across the globe our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of marketing practices moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us our quality and safety our environmental or social impacts our products becoming unavailable to consumers or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations furthermore existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation in addition we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts anticipate consumer preferences or invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation or brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as private label products which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories increase our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories 

our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in fastergrowing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we have decided and could in the future decide to and have been or could in the future be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration product mislabeling or misbranding tampering undeclared allergens or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions that could negatively impact our net sales and financial condition 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned and leased manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather raw material shortages natural disasters fires or explosions political unrest terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics such as the new coronavirus that originated in china could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ comanufacturers’ or distributors’ operations these disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

business risks 

we may not successfully identify complete or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures joint ventures or other investments 

from time to time we have evaluated and may continue to evaluate acquisition candidates alliances joint ventures or other investments that may strategically fit our business objectives and we have divested and may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states canada the european union and other jurisdictions and we may be required to obtain the approval of these transactions by competition authorities as well as to satisfy other legal requirements 

to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances joint ventures investments or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the fcpa currency rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

to the extent we undertake divestitures we may face additional risks related to such activity for example risks related to our ability to find appropriate buyers to execute transactions on favorable terms to separate divested businesses from our remaining operations and to effectively manage any transitional service arrangements any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness 

we have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives including our multiyear program announced following the 2015 merger that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated and continue to evaluate changes to our organizational structure to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of these or other cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must accurately predict costs and be efficient in executing any plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute in those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from any costsaving efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production profitability financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives 

we plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets consumer demands behaviors tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels we may also face difficulties divesting business operations with minimal impact to the retained businesses there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations or that any divestiture will be completed without disruption which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

we are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets approximately 29 of our 2019 net sales were generated outside of the united states as a result we are subject to risks inherent in global operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include 



 in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do business 

our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets including uncertainties surrounding the legal and regulatory effects of brexit in the transition period and beyond changes to major international trade arrangements eg the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the imposition of tariffs by certain foreign governments including china and canada could negatively impact our operations and sales though the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 the uncertainties around the impacts of brexit remain during the transition period and while a new trade agreement is negotiated as a result we continue to evaluate the risks associated with the withdrawal including the potential for supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility other factors impacting our operations in the united states and in international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions currency exchange rates currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions and our responses to them could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results for further information on venezuela see note 15 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

we rely on our management team and other key personnel and may be unable to hire or retain key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel and a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business unplanned turnover failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions including the chief executive officer position could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees any such loss failure or limitation could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyberattacks and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions reputational damage transaction errors processing inefficiencies the leakage of confidential information and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations damage to our reputation and credibility loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or consumers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

we are also subject to various laws and regulations that are continuously evolving and developing regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data such laws and regulations as well as their interpretation and application may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction which can result in inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 adds a broad array of requirements with respect to personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 among other things imposes additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of california residents the ccpa provides civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches gdpr ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may increase our costs of compliance and risks of noncompliance which could result in substantial penalties 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers distributors or regulators operate 

we have been and may in the future be impacted by severe weather and other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers distributors or regulators natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ or distributors’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products influenza or other pandemics such as the new coronavirus that originated in china could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations while we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks and have policies and procedures to manage business continuity planning we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters or that our business continuity plans will effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner to the extent we are unable to or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain 

the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future 

as of december 28 2019 the sponsors own approximately 47 of our common stock three of our current 11 directors had been directors of heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 merger and remained directors of kraft heinz pursuant to the merger agreement in addition the board elected joao m castroneves a partner of 3g capital one of the sponsors effective june 12 2019 furthermore paulo basilio our chief financial officer is a partner of 3g capital as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our board of directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors were to collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock the directors designated by the sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional capital stock the incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether to declare dividends and the amount of any such dividends additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 

financial risks 

our level of indebtedness as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt our existing debt together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences including but not limited to 

 in addition there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

our indebtedness instruments contain customary representations warranties and covenants including a financial covenant in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “senior credit facility” to maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses the creditors who hold our debt could accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines or if we are unable to comply with any covenant such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the sec we have in the past and may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default 

if we breach any covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors or we may not be able to remedy compliance within the terms of any waivers approved by the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments and unable to access our senior credit facility in addition certain creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

additional impairments of the carrying amounts of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain 19 reporting units 11 of which comprise our goodwill balance our indefinitelived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands  we test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes disposals of significant brands or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate or changes in management strategy we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions these assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates royalty rates contributory asset charges  and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including as a result of updates to our global fiveyear operating plan then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future  which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth we are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the company as part of this strategic review we expect to develop updates to the fiveyear operating plan in 2020 which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates additionally as a result of this strategic review process we could decide to divest certain nonstrategic assets as a result the ongoing development of the enterprise strategy and underlying detailed business plans could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units or brands in the future  

as a result of our annual and interim impairment tests we recognized goodwill impairment losses of 70 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 89 billion in 2018 and goodwill impairment losses of 12 billion and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses of 687 million in 2019 our reporting units and brands that were impaired in 2018 and 2019 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates accordingly these and other individual reporting units and brands that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future reporting units with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 324 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included us grocery us refrigerated us foodservice canada retail canada foodservice latin america exports and emea east reporting units with between 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 676 million as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included continental europe and northeast asia the aggregate goodwill carrying amount of reporting units with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 24 billion and there were no reporting units with fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50 as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date brands with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of 262 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included kraft  philadelphia  velveeta  lunchables  miracle whip  planters  maxwell house  cool whip  and abc  brands with between 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of 37 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included oscar mayer  jet puffed  wattie’s  and quero  the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 42 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date although the remaining brands have more than 50 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date these amounts are also associated with the 2013 heinz acquisition and the 2015 merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values therefore if any estimates market factors or assumptions including those related to our enterprise strategy or business plans change in the future these amounts are also susceptible to impairments 

our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

we derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah chinese renminbi and indian rupee since our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 

commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat products cucumbers onions other fruits and vegetables spices cocoa products and flour to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals cardboard glass plastic paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as natural gas and water to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade tariffs alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations furthermore the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes or we may be constrained from increasing the prices of our products by competitive and consumer pressures if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income 

we use commodity futures options and swaps to economically hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products meat products coffee beans sugar vegetable oils wheat products corn products cocoa products packaging products diesel fuel and natural gas we recognize gains and losses based on changes in the values of these commodity derivatives we recognize these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we recognize these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying products at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results accordingly changes in the values of our commodity derivatives may cause volatility in our gross profit and net income 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

furthermore we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with unionrepresented employees both in and outside of the united states 

regulatory risks 

compliance with laws regulations and related interpretations and related legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could impact our business and we face additional risks and uncertainties related to any potential actions resulting from the sec’s ongoing investigation as well as potential additional subpoenas litigation and regulatory proceedings 

as a large global food and beverage company we operate in a highlyregulated environment with constantlyevolving legal and regulatory frameworks various laws and regulations govern production storage distribution sales advertising labeling including onpack claims information or disclosures marketing licensing trade labor tax environmental matters privacy as well as health and safety and data protection practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations in particular brexit could result in a new regulatory regime in the united kingdom that may or may not follow that of the european union and the creation of new and divergent laws and regulations could increase the cost and complexity of our compliance in addition this shift in regime could create a number of legal and accounting complexities with respect to existing relationships including uncertainty regarding the continuity of contracts entered into by entities in the united kingdom or the european union our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations as a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate we are faced with a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions 

as previously disclosed on february 21 2019 we received a subpoena in october 2018 from the sec related to our procurement area specifically the accounting policies procedures and internal controls related to our procurement function including but not limited to agreements side agreements and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers following the receipt of this subpoena we together with external counsel and forensic accountants and subsequently under the oversight of the audit committee conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters the sec has issued additional subpoenas seeking information related to our financial reporting internal controls disclosures our assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments our communications with certain shareholders and other procurementrelated information and materials in connection with its investigation the united states attorney’s office for the northern district of illinois “usao” is also reviewing this matter  we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit a class action lawsuit brought under the employee retirement income security act “erisa” a consolidated stockholder derivative action pending in federal court and eight stockholder derivative actions pending in the delaware court of chancery 

we are cooperating with the sec and usao and intend to vigorously defend the civil lawsuits we are unable at this time to estimate our potential liability in these matters in connection with the securities and erisa class action lawsuits and the stockholder derivative actions we may be required to pay judgments settlements or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses see item 3 legal proceedings  and note 17 commitments and contingencies  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information 

in connection with the sec and usao investigations we could be required to pay significant civil or criminal penalties and become subject to injunctions cease and desist orders and other equitable remedies the sec and usao investigations have not been resolved as of the filing of this annual report on form 10k we can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory investigation 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses related to legal accounting and other professional services in connection with the internal investigation the sec investigation and related legal and regulatory matters these expenses have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and cash flows 

as a result of matters associated with the internal investigation related to the sec investigation and various lawsuits we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses or if we experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results in which case our business may be harmed investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the price of our common stock may decline 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” as a public company we are required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act and other rules that govern public companies in particular we are required to certify our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in addition our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

consistent with the prior year and in connection with our 2019 yearend assessment of internal control over financial reporting we determined that as of december 28 2019 we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting because of a material weakness in our risk assessment process related to designing and maintaining controls sufficient to appropriately respond to changes in our business environment this material weakness in risk assessment also contributed to a material weakness arising from supplier contracts and related arrangements and we have taken and are taking certain remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting for further discussion of the material weaknesses identified and our remedial efforts see item 9a controls and procedures  

remediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes as a result we may not be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material weaknesses identified by management be able to do so in a timely manner or be able to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies including material weaknesses in the future 

if we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected our liquidity our access to capital markets the perceptions of our creditworthiness and our ability to complete acquisitions may be adversely affected we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable securities laws the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” listing requirements and the covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting we may suffer defaults accelerations or crossaccelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or are unable to cure any breaches and our stock price may decline 

our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the sec limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital 

we did not file our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 29 2018 or our quarterly report on form 10q for the fiscal quarter ended march 30 2019 within each respective timeframe required by the sec meaning we did not remain current in our reporting requirements with the sec as such we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on form s3 that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our sec reports into the registration statement or to use “shelf” registration statements to conduct offerings until we have maintained our status as a current filer for approximately one year this limits our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business if we wish to pursue a public offering now we would be required to file a registration statement on form s1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the sec doing so would likely take significantly longer than using a registration statement on form s3 and increase our transaction costs and the necessity of using a form s1 for a public offering of registered securities could to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner 

we restated certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues 

as discussed in the explanatory note in note 2 restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements  and in note 23 quarterly financial data unaudited  in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 29 2018 we restated our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 and restated each of the quarterly and yeartodate periods for the nine months ended september 29 2018 and for fiscal year 2017 following the identification of misstatements as a result of the internal investigation conducted we do not believe that the misstatements were quantitatively material to any period presented in our prior financial statements however due to the qualitative nature of the matters identified in our internal investigation including the number of years over which the misconduct occurred and the number of transactions suppliers and procurement employees involved we determined that it would be appropriate to correct the misstatements in our previously issued consolidated financial statements by restating such financial statements the restatement also included corrections for additional identified outofperiod and uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods as a result we incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets trade dress copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to develop or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition we also license certain intellectual property most notably trademarks from third parties to the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed additionally the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate a number of factors influence our effective tax rate including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules federal state and local governments and administrative bodies within the united states which represents the majority of our operations and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented or are considering a variety of broad tax trade and other regulatory reforms that may impact us for example the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax reform” enacted on december 22 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax rate our deferred income taxes and the taxation of foreign earnings relatedly changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit sharing “beps” could impact our effective tax rate it is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential comprehensive impact of these or future changes but these changes could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 

significant judgment knowledge and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in geographic mix of income increases in expenses not deductible for tax including impairment of goodwill and changes in available tax credits in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult the results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

registered securities risks 

sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market sales of our common stock by the sponsors or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities a sustained depression in the market price of our common stock has happened which was a contributing factor to our decision to perform interim impairment tests for certain reporting units and brands in 2018 and 2019 for which we ultimately recorded impairment losses and could in the future happen which could also reduce our market capitalization below the book value of net assets which could increase the likelihood of recognizing goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset impairment losses that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

kraft heinz 3g capital and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g capital and berkshire hathaway which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of december 28 2019 registrable shares represented approximately 47 of all outstanding shares of our common stock although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a “lockup” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly offers and sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement sales of our common stock by the sponsors to other persons would likely result in an increase in the number of shares being traded in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders and the amounts of any such dividends are subject to the discretion of the board of directors and may be limited by our financial condition debt agreements or limitations under delaware law 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends and the amounts thereof will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law debt agreements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant the board of directors has decided and may in the future decide in its sole discretion to change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity uncertainty regarding brexit in the transition period and beyond and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt our us dollar variable rate debt uses libor as a benchmark for determining interest rates and the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 while we do not expect that the transition from libor including any legal or regulatory changes made in response to its future phase out or the risks related to its discontinuance will have a material effect on our financing costs the impact is uncertain at this time 

some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable increasing our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings 

our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm credit ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these credit ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results on february 14 2020 moody’s investor services inc “moody’s” affirmed our longterm credit rating of baa3 with a negative outlook and fitch ratings “fitch” and sp global ratings “sp” downgraded our longterm credit rating from bbb to bb with a stable outlook from fitch and a negative outlook from sp the downgrades by fitch and sp reduce our senior debt below investment grade potentially resulting in higher borrowing costs on future financings and potentially limiting access to our commercial paper program and other sources of funding which may result in us having to use more expensive sources of liquidity such as our senior credit facility these downgrades do not constitute a default or event of default under our debt instruments however as two ratings agencies have downgraded our longterm credit rating to below investment grade status we are subject to certain financial covenants in our 4875 second lien senior secured notes due february 15 2025 the “2025 notes”

 fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 

operating incomeloss increased 1301 to income of 31 billion in 2019 compared to a loss of 102 billion in 2018 this increase was primarily driven by lower impairment losses in the current year impairment losses were 19 billion in 2019 compared to 159 billion in 2018 excluding the impact of these impairment losses operating incomeloss decreased by 762 million primarily due to lower organic net sales higher supply chain costs the unfavorable impact of foreign currency 08 pp higher general corporate expenses and the unfavorable impact of divestitures partially offset by lower restructuring expenses in the current period see note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our impairment losses

results of operations by segment 

management evaluates segment performance based on several factors including net sales organic net sales and segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome provision forbenefit from income taxes and depreciation and amortization excluding integration and restructuring expenses in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses deal costs unrealized gainslosses on commodity hedges the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results impairment losses and equity award compensation expense excluding integration and restructuring expenses segment adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net incomeloss rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary the exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are recorded in current net incomeloss and are classified within other expenseincome as nonmonetary currency devaluation see note 15 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation  and note 2 significant accounting policies in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information

segment adjusted ebitda decreased 78 to 48 billion in 2019 compared to 52 billion in 2018 this decrease was primarily due to lower organic net sales cost inflation in procurement and manufacturing strategic investments and supply chain losses

segment adjusted ebitda decreased 428 to 363 million in 2019 compared to 635 million in 2018 including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency  226 pp  including 208 pp from the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and costs not expected to repeat from a combination of higher laborrelated expenses from the impact of the holidays act in new zealand as well as asset and inventoryrelated writeoffs in australia new zealand and latin america excluding these factors the decrease in segment adjusted ebitda was primarily due to higher supply chain costs and the heinz india transaction which closed on january 30 2019 

critical accounting estimates 

note 2 significant accounting policies  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from customer orders for the purchase of our products we recognize revenues as performance obligations are fulfilled when control passes to our customers we record revenues net of variable consideration including consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions excluding taxes and including all shipping and handling charges billed to customers accounting for shipping and handling charges that occur after the transfer of control as fulfillment costs we also record a refund liability for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors we recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses as our contracts are generally less than one year 

advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and performance obligations related to trade promotions consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates performancebased instore display activities and volumebased incentives variable consideration related to consumer incentive and trade promotion activities is recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization redemption rates andor current period experience factors we review and adjust these estimates at least quarterly based on actual experience and other information 

advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses “sga”  for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we then review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information we recorded advertising expenses of 534 million in 2019 584 million in 2018 and 629 million in 2017 which represented costs to obtain physical advertisement spots in television radio print digital and social channels we also incur other advertising and marketing costs such as shopper marketing sponsorships and agency advertisement conception design and public relations fees total advertising and marketing costs were 11 billion in 2019 2018 and 2017 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we maintain 19 reporting units 11 of which comprise our goodwill balance these 11 reporting units had an aggregate carrying amount of 355 billion as of december 28 2019  our indefinitelived intangible asset balance primarily consists of a number of individual brands which had an aggregate carrying amount of 434 billion as of december 28 2019  

we test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of the first day of our second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes disposals of significant brands or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate or changes in management strategy we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test brands for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or brand exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions these assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates royalty rates contributory asset charges  and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including as a result of updates to our global fiveyear operating plan then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future  we are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the company as part of this strategic review we expect to develop updates to the fiveyear operating plan in 2020 which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates additionally as a result of this strategic review process we could decide to divest certain nonstrategic assets as a result the ongoing development of the enterprise strategy and underlying detailed business plans could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units or brands in the future  or a decision to amortize indefinitelived intangible assets over a defined period of time 

as detailed in note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  we recorded impairment losses related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the current year and in the prior year our reporting units and brands that were impaired in 2018 and 2019 were written down to their respective fair values resulting in zero excess fair value over carrying amount as of the applicable impairment test dates accordingly these and other individual reporting units and brands that have 20 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future reporting units with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 324 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included us grocery us refrigerated us foodservice canada retail canada foodservice latin america exports and emea east reporting units with between 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate goodwill carrying amount of 676 million as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included continental europe and northeast asia the aggregate goodwill carrying amount of reporting units with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 24 billion and there were no reporting units with fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50 as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date brands with 10 or less fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount after impairment of 262 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included kraft  philadelphia  velveeta  lunchables  miracle whip  planters  maxwell house  cool whip  and abc  brands with between 1020 fair value over carrying amount had an aggregate carrying amount of 37 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date and included oscar mayer  jet puffed  wattie’s  and quero  the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 2050 was 42 billion as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date although the remaining brands with a carrying value of 92 billion  have more than 50 excess fair value over carrying amount as of their latest 2019 impairment testing date these amounts are also associated with the 2013 heinz acquisition and the 2015 merger and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values therefore if any estimates market factors or assumptions including those related to our enterprise strategy or business plans change in the future these amounts are also susceptible to impairments 

we generally utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit including net sales cost of products sold sga depreciation and amortization working capital and capital expenditures income tax rates longterm growth rates and a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in each future cash flow stream we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

we utilize the excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of certain of our largest brands some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each brand including net sales cost of products sold and sga contributory asset charges income tax considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future earnings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

we utilize the relief from royalty method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our remaining brands some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net sales for each brand royalty rates as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee income tax considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies 

the discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 10 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts as of the latest 2019 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand were as follows 



the discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates used to estimate the fair values of our reporting units and brands with between 1020 excess fair value over carry amount as well as the goodwill or brand carrying amounts as of the latest 2019 impairment testing date for each reporting unit or brand were as follows 



assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment therefore they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date additionally these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation however as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur as a sensitivity measure we have presented the estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates longterm growth rates and royalty rates on the fair values of our reporting units and brands with 10 or less excess fair value over carrying amount and between 1020 excess fair value over carrying amount these estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline 

if we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with 10 or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the latest 2019 impairment testing date for each of these reporting units and brands these isolated changes which are reasonably possible to occur would have led to the following increasedecrease in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands in billions 



if we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and brands with between 1020 excess fair value over carrying amount as of the latest 2019 impairment testing date for each of these reporting units and brands these isolated changes which are reasonably possible to occur would have led to the following increasedecrease in the aggregate fair value of these reporting units and brands in billions 



definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated periods benefited we review definitelived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate currentperiod operating or cash flow losses significant declines in forecasted operations or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of definitelived intangible assets held for use we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on definitelived intangible assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

see note 9 goodwill and intangible assets  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for our impairment testing results 

postemployment benefit plans 

we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over an appropriate term based on among other things the cost component and whether the plan is active or inactive changes in the fair value of our plan assets result in net actuarial gains or losses these net actuarial gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses and amortized within other expenseincome in future periods using the corridor approach the corridor is 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of the plan’s asset or projected benefit obligation any actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are then amortized over an appropriate term based on whether the plan is active or inactive 

for our postretirement benefit plans our 2020 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 65 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 49 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2020 and 2030 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects increasedecrease in cost and obligation as of december 28 2019 in millions 



our 2020 discount rate assumption will be 33 for service cost and 27 for interest cost for our postretirement plans our 2020 discount rate assumption will be 36 for service cost and 30 for interest cost for our us pension plans and 25 for service cost and 18 for interest cost for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2020 expected return on plan assets will be 47 net of applicable taxes for our postretirement plans our 2020 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 45 for our us pension plans and 38 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2020 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basispoint change in our discount rate or a 100basispoint change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost in millions 



income taxes 

we compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position

contingencies 

see note 17 commitments and contingencies  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of our contingencies 

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products and wheat products to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities 

we define our key commodities in the united states and canada as dairy meat coffee and nuts in 2019 we experienced cost increases for dairy and meat while costs for nuts and coffee decreased we manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies as a result of these risk management strategies our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends 

dairy commodities primarily milk and cheese are the most significant cost components of our cheese products we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components of our meat products include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on global markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and global markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of prices 

liquidity and capital resources 

on february 14 2020 fitch and sp downgraded our longterm credit rating from bbb to bb with a stable outlook from fitch and a negative outlook from sp as a result of the downgrades our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program may be adversely affected for a period of time due to limitations on or elimination of our ability to access the commercial paper market in addition we could experience an increase in interest costs as a result of the downgrades we do not expect any change in our plans to access liquidity over the next year as a result of the downgrades these downgrades do not constitute a default or event of default under any of our debt instruments limitations on or elimination of our ability to access the commercial paper program may require us to borrow under the senior credit facility if necessary to meet liquidity needs our ability to borrow under the senior credit facility is not affected by the downgrades 

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities and senior credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs future contractual obligations including repayments of longterm debt payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends planned capital expenditures restructuring expenditures and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans an additional potential source of liquidity is access to capital markets we intend to use our cash on hand for daily funding requirements and access to our senior credit facility if necessary overall while we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on form s3 for any public offerings of registered debt or equity securities to raise capital we do not expect our ineligibility to use a registration statement on form s3 to have any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our shortterm or longterm liquidity 

cash flow activity for 2019 compared to 2018 

net cash provided byused for operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 36 billion for the year ended december 28 2019 compared to 26 billion for the year ended december 29 2018  this increase was primarily driven by higher collections on trade receivables resulting from the reduction of receivables recorded as a noncash exchange for sold receivables as we unwound all of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs the “programs” in 2018 and as our trade receivables balance was higher at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017 this increase was partially offset by a federal tax refund received in the prior year tax payments associated with the heinz india transaction and increased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2019 see note 16 financing arrangements  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our programs 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 15 billion for the year ended december 28 2019 compared to 288 million for the year ended december 29 2018  this increase was primarily driven by proceeds from our canada natural cheese transaction and heinz india transaction proceeds from our net investment hedges lower capital expenditures and lower cash payments to acquire businesses year over year these increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by lower cash collections on previously sold receivables as we unwound all of our programs in 2018 we expect 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately 750 million  see note 4 acquisitions and divestitures  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on the canada natural cheese transaction the heinz india transaction and our acquisitions 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 39 billion for the year ended december 28 2019 compared to 34 billion for the year ended december 29 2018  this increase was primarily driven by higher repayments of longterm debt and higher debt prepayment and extinguishment costs primarily related to our tender offers in september 2019 and debt redemptions in october 2019 these increases to net cash used for financing activities were partially offset by decreased cash distributions related to our dividends and lower net repayments of commercial paper proceeds from longterm debt issuances were mostly flat year over year see note 18 debt  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information on our tender offers see equity and dividends in this item for additional information on our dividends 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

of the 23 billion cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at december 28 2019  869 million was held by international subsidiaries 

subsequent to january 1 2018 we consider the unremitted earnings of certain international subsidiaries that impose local country taxes on dividends to be indefinitely reinvested for those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our us cash requirements the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for local country withholding taxes that would be owed related to our 2018 and 2019 accumulated earnings of certain international subsidiaries is approximately 70 million  

our undistributed historic earnings in foreign subsidiaries through december 30 2017 are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested as of december 28 2019  we have recorded a deferred tax liability of 20 million on approximately 300 million of historic earnings related to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed as of december 29 2018  we had recorded a deferred tax liability of 78 million on 12 billion of historic earnings the decreases in our deferred tax liability and historic earnings are primarily due to repatriation related to these distributions we reduced our historic earnings by approximately 700 million and recorded tax expenses of approximately 40 million and reduced the deferred tax liability accordingly additionally we reduced our historic earnings by approximately 110 million following the ratification of the us tax treaty with spain which eliminated withholding tax on spanish distributions and resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 11 million and a corresponding decrease in our deferred tax liability finally we reduced our historic earnings by approximately 30 million related to a held for sale business in our rest of world segment which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately 6 million  

trade payables programs 

in order to manage our cash flow and related liquidity we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with our suppliers which we deem to be commercially reasonable generally range from 0 to 200 days we also maintain agreements with third party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us and at the sole discretion of the supplier sell one or more of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions our obligations to our suppliers including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary we estimate that the amounts outstanding under these programs were 370 million at december 28 2019 and 440 million at december 29 2018  

borrowing arrangements 

we have historically obtained funding through our us and european commercial paper programs we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 28 2019 or at december 29 2018  the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year ended december 28 2019 was 200 million  

we maintain our 40 billion senior credit facility and subject to certain conditions we may increase the amount of revolving commitments andor add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to 10 billion no amounts were drawn on our senior credit facility at december 28 2019  at december 29 2018  or during the years ended december 28 2019  december 29 2018  and december 30 2017  the senior credit facility contains representations warranties and covenants that are typical for these types of facilities and could upon the occurrence of certain events of default restrict our ability to access our senior credit facility we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 28 2019  

longterm debt 

our longterm debt including the current portion was 292 billion at december 28 2019 and 311 billion at december 29 2018  this decrease was primarily related to the 29 billion aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes and second lien senior secured notes that were validly tendered in september 2019 the redemption of approximately 15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in october 2019 and the repayment of 350 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in august 2019 these decreases to longterm debt were partially offset by the 30 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in september 2019 we used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes together with cash on hand to fund our tender offers in september 2019 and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and to fund the partial redemption of 13 billion aggregate principal amount of our 2800 senior notes due july 2020 and 300 million canadian dollar senior notes due july 2020 

we repaid approximately 405 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes on february 10 2020 we have aggregate principal amount of senior notes of approximately 500 million canadian dollars and 200 million maturing in july 2020 we expect to fund these longterm debt repayments primarily with cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities 

our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december 28 2019  

see note 18 debt  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for additional information related to our longterm debt 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

we have utilized accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs globally for our working capital needs and to provide efficient liquidity during 2018 we had programs in place in various countries across the globe in the second quarter of 2018 we unwound our us securitization program which represented the majority of our programs using proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in june 2018 as of december 29 2018  we had unwound all of our programs 

see note 16 financing arrangements  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for a discussion of our programs and other financing arrangements 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 28 2019 in millions 



 pension plan contributions were 19 million in 2019 we estimate that 2020 pension plan contributions will be approximately 19 million  beyond 2020 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated pension plan contributions for 2020 have been excluded from the above table 

postretirement benefit plan contributions were 12 million in 2019 we estimate that 2020 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately 15 million  beyond 2020 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated postretirement benefit plan contributions for 2020 have been excluded from the above table 

at december 28 2019  the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 468 million  the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table 

equity and dividends 

we paid common stock dividends of 20 billion in 2019 32 billion in 2018 and 29 billion in 2017 additionally on february 13 2020 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 040 per share of common stock which is payable on march 27 2020 to shareholders of record on march 13 2020 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with us gaap 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap we have presented organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps which are considered nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way these measures are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as net sales net incomeloss diluted earnings per common share “eps” or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

management uses these nongaap financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures ie organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures 

organic net sales is defined as net sales excluding when they occur the impact of currency acquisitions and divestitures and a 53rd week of shipments we calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate organic net sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome provision forbenefit from income taxes and depreciation and amortization excluding integration and restructuring expenses in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses deal costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses and equity award compensation expense excluding integration and restructuring expenses adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses deal costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses lossesgains on the sale of a business other lossesgains related to acquisitions and divestitures eg tax and hedging impacts nonmonetary currency devaluation eg remeasurement gains and losses debt prepayment and extinguishment costs and us tax reform discrete income tax expensebenefit and including when they occur adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis we believe adjusted eps provides important comparability of underlying operating results allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis

we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices foreign exchange rates and interest rates we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results we maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments the derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments see note 2 significant accounting policies  and note 13 financial instruments  in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures 

when we use financial instruments we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement by policy we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

effect of hypothetical 10 fluctuation in market prices   

the potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts and crosscurrency swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates would have been in millions 



it should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items in relation to foreign currency contracts this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations debt repayments and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities 

effect of hypothetical 1 fluctuation in libor and cdor   

based on our current variable rate debt balance as of december 28 2019  a hypothetical 1 increase in libor and cdor would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 12 million  the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 given our current variable rate debt outstanding we do not anticipate a significant impact to our annual interest expense as a result of the transition

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 28 2019  based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 28 2019  due to the existence of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that 

 because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2019 based on the framework described in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this evaluation our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2019 due to the material weaknesses described below 

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 29 2018  we identified a material weakness in the risk assessment component of internal control as we did not appropriately design controls in response to the risk of misstatement due to changes in our business environment this material weakness in risk assessment gave rise to the specific control deficiency described below which we also determined to be a material weakness and both material weaknesses have not been remediated as of december 28 2019  

 additionally the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of substantially all account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 

pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2019  as stated in their report which appears herein under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  

remediation efforts to address material weaknesses 

our management with oversight from our audit committee is in the process of executing a plan to remediate the material weaknesses described above this plan includes the implementation of additional controls and procedures to strengthen our internal controls related to our risk assessment component of internal control over financial reporting and supplier contracts and related arrangements to date the following actions have been taken towards our remediation plan 

 the remaining actions outlined in the remediation plan from what had been previously communicated in the annual report on form 10k for the period ended december 29 2018 include the following 



 we have begun and expect to continue implementing various changes in our internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weaknesses described above we continue to make progress on our remediation and our goal is to implement the remaining control improvements related to these material weaknesses during 2020 we will also continue to review optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or we may modify certain of the remediation measures described above these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively 

remediation of previously reported material weakness 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the period ended december 29 2018  we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used to review the impairment assessments related to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as changes in our business environment occurred specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to reassess the level of precision used in the review of the allocation of cash flow projections to certain brands used as a basis for performing our fourth quarter 2018 interim impairment assessments in response to the significant reduction in and in certain instances elimination of the excess fair value over carrying amount of certain brands that resulted from changes in our business environment 

due to the actions taken by the company to implement new controls and procedures management has concluded that this material weakness has been remediated as of december 28 2019  the actions we took to remediate this material weakness were as follows 

 changes in internal control over financial reporting 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with other members of management evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended december 28 2019  we determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended december 28 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

general 

kraft heinz is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world with sales in approximately 190  countries and territories we manufacture and market food and beverage products including condiments and sauces cheese and dairy meals meats refreshment beverages coffee and other grocery products throughout the world under a host of iconic brands including heinz  kraft  oscar mayer  philadelphia  velveeta lunchables  planters maxwell house  capri sun oreida koolaid jello a globally recognized producer of delicious foods we provide products for all occasions whether at home in restaurants or on the go as of december 30 2017  we had assets of 1202 billion  our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market “nasdaq” under the ticker symbol “khc” 

on july 2 2015 the “2015 merger date” through a series of transactions we consummated the merger of kraft foods group inc “kraft” with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of hj heinz holding corporation “heinz” the “2015 merger” at the closing of the 2015 merger heinz was renamed the kraft heinz company and h j heinz company changed its name to kraft heinz foods company while we were organized as a delaware corporation in 2013 as heinz both kraft and heinz each had been pioneers in the food industry for over 100 years 

before the consummation of the 2015 merger heinz was controlled by berkshire hathaway inc berkshire hathaway and 3g global food holdings lp “3g capital” together the sponsors following their acquisition of h j heinz company the “2013 merger” 

see note 1 background and basis of presentation  and note 2 merger and acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 merger 

reportable segments 

we manage and report our operating results through four  segments we have three  reportable segments defined by geographic region united states canada and europe our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “rest of world” rest of world is comprised of two  operating segments latin america and asia pacific middle east and africa “amea” 

in the third quarter of 2017 we announced our plans to reorganize certain of our international businesses to better align our global geographies these plans include moving our middle east and africa businesses from the amea segment into the europe segment forming the europe middle east and africa “emea” segment the remaining amea businesses will become the asia pacific “apac” segment which will remain in rest of world we expect these changes to become effective in the first quarter of 2018 as a result we expect to restate our europe and rest of world segments to reflect these changes for historical periods presented in the first quarter of 2018   

see note 19 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements for our geographic financial information by segment 

net sales by product category 

in the first quarter of 2017 we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business we have reflected this change for all historical periods presented  the product categories that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were 



we completed the 2015 merger on july 2 2015 as a result 2016 was the first full year of combined kraft and heinz results while 2015 included a full year of heinz results and post2015 merger results of kraft the yearoveryear fluctuations in the percentages between 2015 and 2016 are primarily driven by including kraft’s results 

sales and customers 

our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers agents and distributors to chain wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies our products are also sold online through various ecommerce platforms and retailers our largest customer walmart inc represented approximately 21  of our net sales in 2017 approximately 22 of our net sales in 2016 and approximately 20  of our net sales in 2015 

additionally we have significant customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers individually are material to our consolidated business in 2017 the five largest customers in our united states segment accounted for approximately 48 of united states segment net sales the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 72 of canada segment net sales and the five largest customers in our europe  segment accounted for approximately 31 of our europe  segment net sales 

raw materials and packaging 

we manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw food materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat and other goods to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status andor have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy and agricultural programs 

our procurement teams monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures 

competition 

our products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of ecommerce retailers largeformat retailers and discounters competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and generic products in addition to retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation brand recognition and loyalty service the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs distribution shelf space merchandising support and price improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

trademarks and intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms significant trademarks by segment based on net sales in 2017 were 



used under license 

we sell some products under brands we license from third parties including capri sun  packaged drink pouches for sale in the united states tgi fridays  frozen snacks and appetizers in the united states and canada  mccafe  ground whole bean and ondemand single cup coffees in the united states and canada  and  taco bell home originals mexicanstyle food products in us grocery stores in our agreements with mondelēz international inc “mondelēz international” we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for certain periods of time following the spinoff of kraft from mondelēz international in 2012 

we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

research and development 

our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives 

 research and development expense was approximately   93 million  in 2017 120 million  in 2016 and 105 million  in 2015   

seasonality 

although crops constituting some of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis most of our products are produced throughout the year 

seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products including holidays changes in seasons or other annual events these factors influence our quarterly sales operating income and cash flows 

employees 

we had approximately 39000 employees as of december 30 2017  

regulation 

the manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated our business operations including the production transportation storage distribution sale display advertising marketing labeling quality and safety of our products and their ingredients occupational safety and health practices are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the united states in markets in which our products are manufactured distributed or sold in the us our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies including the food and drug administration us department of agriculture federal trade commission department of labor department of commerce and environmental protection agency as well as various state and local agencies we are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of north america including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety health and safety anticorruption and data privacy in our business dealings we are also required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act and various other anticorruption regulations in the regions in which we operate we rely on legal and operational compliance programs as well as inhouse and outside counsel to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business 

environmental regulation 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws concerning the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations 

in the united states where a significant portion of our business operates these laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions and legislation related to our current operations and certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability we do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition 

as of december 30 2017  we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings we compete based on product innovation price product quality nutritional value service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively assess timely change and set proper pricing or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives 

the rapid emergence of new distribution channels particularly ecommerce may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may suffer 

changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may continue to consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business across various channels consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing more favorable terms increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets if we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition across the globe our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us our quality and safety our environmental or social impacts or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation in addition we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation or brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

we are a global company with sales in approximately 190  countries and territories approximately 30  of our 2017 net sales were generated outside of the united states as a result we are subject to risks inherent in global operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include 

 in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased sales and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovation 

consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or potential impacts on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories increase our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017 the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its fair value 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate additionally recently impaired intangible assets can also be more susceptible to future impairment as they are recorded on the balance sheet at their recently estimated fair values 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worth 

commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products tomatoes cucumbers potatoes onions other fruits and vegetables spices flour and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins cardboard glass plastic metal paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as water and natural gas to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations furthermore the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness 

we have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives including our integration program as defined below that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of our cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute on those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production and profitability could be adversely affected 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact us 

we derive significant portions of our sales from certain significant customers see sales and customers  within item 1 business  of this report there can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control a significant deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategy 

we plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international markets consumer demands behaviors tastes and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations 

changes in tax laws and interpretations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are dependent on the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed additionally the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate a number of factors influence our effective tax rate including changes in tax laws and treaties as well as the interpretation of existing laws and rules federal state and local governments and administrative bodies within the us which represents a majority of our operations and other foreign jurisdictions have implemented or are considering a variety of broad tax trade and other regulatory reforms that may impact us for example the tax cuts and jobs act the “us tax reform” enacted on december 22 2017 resulted in changes in our corporate tax rate our deferred income taxes and the taxation of foreign earnings we are still assessing the impact of the us tax reform and while a number of impacts are anticipated to be positive certain provisions may have adverse or uncertain effects relatedly changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s oecd multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit sharing” could impact our effective tax rate it is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of these proposed or future changes but these changes could have a material impact on our business 

significant judgment knowledge and experience are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes our future effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors including changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities increases in expenses not deductible for tax including impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions and changes in available tax credits in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult the results of an audit or litigation could adversely affect our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

compliance with changes in laws regulations and related interpretations could impact our business 

as a large global food and beverage company we operate in a highlyregulated environment with constantlyevolving legal and regulatory frameworks various laws and regulations govern production storage distribution sales advertising labeling including onpack claims information or disclosures marketing licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters as well as health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations as a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate we are faced with a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions 

although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that courts or regulators will agree with our interpretations or that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and operating results in addition the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration product mislabeling or misbranding tampering or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather raw material shortages natural disasters fire or explosion political unrest terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations these disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate acquisition candidates alliances or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions and we may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities as well as to satisfy other legal requirements 

to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances joint ventures or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the fcpa currency rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do business 

our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business economic and financial uncertainties in our international markets including uncertainties surrounding the united kingdoms impending withdrawal from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and changes to major international trade arrangements eg the north american free trade agreement could negatively impact our operations and sales other factors impacting our operations in the united states and in international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions currency exchange rates currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results for further information on venezuela see note 13 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation to the consolidated financial statements 

volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

furthermore we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with unionrepresented employees both in and outside of the united states 

volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our operating results and net income 

we use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products coffee beans meat products wheat corn products soybean oils sugar and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income resulting in volatility in both gross profits and net income we report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we report these gains and losses in general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying products at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

our net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

we derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah and chinese renminbi since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyberattacks and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions reputational damage transaction errors processing inefficiencies the leakage of confidential information and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations damage to our reputation and credibility loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or consumers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers or regulators operate 

we may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers and regulators natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations while we insure against many of these events and certain business interruption risks we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters to the extent we are unable to or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt our existing debt together with any incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences including but not limited to 

 in addition there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default if we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments the creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future 

the sponsors own approximately 51 of our common stock six of our 11 directors had been directors of heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 merger and remained directors of kraft heinz pursuant to the merger agreement in addition some of our executive officers including bernardo hees our chief executive officer are partners of 3g capital one of the sponsors as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our board of directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock the directors designated by the sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional capital stock incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

kraft heinz 3g capital and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g capital and berkshire hathaway which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of the closing of the 2015 merger registrable shares represented approximately 51 of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a “lockup” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made upon registration of such shares with the sec in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement registration and sales of our common stock effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement will increase the number of shares being sold in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and may be limited by our debt agreements or limitations under delaware law 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law and other factors the board of directors deems relevant the board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

while we have remediated the previouslyidentified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting we may identify other material weaknesses in the future 

in november 2017 we restated our consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended april 1 2017 and july 1 2017 in order to correctly classify cash receipts from the payments on sold receivables which are cash receipts on the underlying trade receivables that have already been securitized to cash provided by investing activities from cash provided by operating activities within our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in connection with these restatements management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of accounting standards update 201615 specifically we did not maintain effective controls over the adoption of new accounting standards including communication with the appropriate individuals in coming to our conclusions on the application of new accounting standards as a result of this material weakness our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of april 1 2017 and july 1 2017 while we have remediated the material weakness and our management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 30 2017 there can be no assurance that our controls will remain adequate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations including judgments used in decisionmaking the nature and complexity of the transactions we undertake assumptions about the likelihood of future events the soundness of our systems cost limitations and other limitations if other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future or we otherwise must restate our financial statements it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties investigations or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence

items affecting comparability of financial results 

the 2015 merger 

we completed the 2015 merger on july 2 2015 as a result 2016 was the first full year of combined kraft and heinz results while 2015 included a full year of heinz results and post2015 merger results of kraft for comparability we disclose in this report certain unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information which presents 2015 as if the 2015 merger had been consummated on december 30 2013 the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year and combines the historical results of heinz and kraft see the supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information  section at the end of this item for additional information 

see note 1 background and basis of presentation to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the 2015 merger 

integration and restructuring expenses 

in 2017 we substantially completed our multiyear program announced following the 2015 merger the “integration program” for which we expect to incur cumulative pretax costs of approximately 21 billion  approximately 60  of these costs will be cash expenditures as of december 30 2017  we have incurred cumulative pretax costs of 2055 million  related to the integration program these costs primarily included severance and employee benefit costs including cash and noncash severance costs to exit facilities including noncash costs such as accelerated depreciation and other costs incurred as a direct result of integration activities related to the 2015 merger 

total expenses related to our restructuring activities including the integration program were 457 million  in 2017 1012 million  in 2016 and 1023 million  in 2015  integration program costs included in these totals were 339 million  in 2017 887 million  in 2016 and 829 million  in 2015   

we anticipate cumulative capital expenditures of approximately 14 billion related to the integration program as of december 30 2017 we have incurred 13 billion in capital expenditures since the inception of the integration program the integration program was designed to reduce costs integrate and optimize our combined organization since the inception of the integration program our cumulative pretax savings achieved are approximately 1725 million primarily benefiting the united states and canada segments 

see note 3 integration and restructuring expenses to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax reform” was enacted by the us federal government the legislation significantly changed us tax law by among other things lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 350  to 210  effective january 1 2018 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 30 2017 the two material items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the onetime toll charge while the corporate tax rate reduction is effective january 1 2018 we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017 the period of enactment 

we have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities including depreciation and executive compensation and the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately 70 billion  including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax benefit of approximately 75 billion  related to the corporate rate change which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of 312 million  for the toll charge and approximately 125 million  for other tax expenses including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion

critical accounting policies 

note 1 background and basis of presentation  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the kraft heinz company as well as our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors 

advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates performance based instore display activities and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization redemption rates or current period experience factors we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information 

advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information we recorded advertising expenses of 629 million  in 2017 708 million  in 2016 and 464 million  in 2015 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets was 985 billion  at december 30 2017  and 974 billion  at december 31 2016  these balances are largely attributable to asset valuations performed in connection with the 2013 merger and the 2015 merger see note 2 merger and acquisition  and note 7 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional information 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value 

we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2017 no impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2017 annual goodwill impairment test each of our goodwill reporting units had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10 as of april 2 2017 our goodwill impairment testing date additionally as a result of our annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests we recognized a noncash impairment loss of 49 million  in sga in 2017 this loss was due to continued declines in nutritional beverages in india the loss was recorded in our europe segment as the related trademark is owned by our italian subsidiary each of our other brands had excess fair value over its carrying value of at least 10  as of april 2 2017   

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate 

definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated periods benefited and are reviewed when appropriate for possible impairment 

postemployment benefit plans 

we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and sga 

for our postretirement benefit plans our 2018 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 67 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 49 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2018 and 2030 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects increasedecrease in cost and obligation as of december 30 2017  in millions 



our 2018 discount rate assumption will be 36 for service cost and 30 for interest cost for our postretirement plans our 2018 discount rate assumption will be 38 for service cost and 33 for interest cost for our us pension plans and 30 for service cost and 22 for interest cost for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

in 2016 we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension costbenefit and net postretirement benefit plan costs resulting in a decrease to these cost components we now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

our 2018 expected return on plan assets will be 44 net of applicable taxes for our postretirement plans our 2018 expected rate of return on plan assets will be 55 for our us pension plans and 45 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2018 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basis point change in our discount rate or a 100basispoint change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effects increasedecrease in cost in millions 



income taxes 

we compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position 

us tax reform significantly changed us tax law by among other things lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 350  to 210  effective january 1 2018 implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 30 2017 in addition there are many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income provisions “gilti” the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” and a deduction for foreignderived intangible income “fdii” the two material items that impacted us in 2017 were the corporate tax rate reduction and the onetime toll charge while the corporate tax rate reduction is effective january 1 2018 we accounted for this anticipated rate change in 2017 the period of enactment 

the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which provides us with up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of us tax reform when the initial accounting for us tax reform impacts is incomplete we may include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made we have estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge certain components of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities including depreciation and executive compensation and the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result we recognized a net tax benefit of approximately 70 billion  including a reasonable estimate of our deferred income tax benefit of approximately 75 billion  related to the corporate rate change which was partially offset by a reasonable estimate of 312 million  for the toll charge and approximately 125 million  for other tax expenses including a change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion we have elected to account for the tax on gilti as a period cost and thus have not adjusted any of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for us tax reform the ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to gathering additional information to more precisely compute the amount of tax changes in interpretations and assumptions additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions we may take we expect to finalize accounting for the impacts of us tax reform when the 2017 us corporate income tax return is filed in 2018 

in connection with us tax reform we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider the historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 30 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested we have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed as a result we have recorded deferred income taxes of 96 million  on approximately 12 billion  of historic earnings   

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 background and basis of presentation  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 

contingencies 

see note 15 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our contingencies 

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities 

we define our key commodities in the united states and canada as dairy meat coffee and nuts in 2017 we experienced cost increases in our key commodities including dairy meat and coffee while costs for nuts were flat we manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies as a result of these risk management strategies our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends 

dairy commodities primarily milk and cheese are the most significant cost components of our cheese products we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components in our meat business include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on global markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and global markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of prices 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities securitization programs commercial paper programs and senior credit facility as defined below will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs restructuring expenditures planned capital expenditures contributions to our postemployment benefit plans future contractual obligations including repayments of longterm debt and payment of our anticipated quarterly common stock dividends we intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper programs for daily funding requirements overall we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our shortterm or longterm liquidity 

cash flow activity for 2017 compared to 2016 

net cash provided byused for operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 527 million  for the year  ended december 30 2017  compared to 26 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2016  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the 12 billion prefunding of our postretirement benefit plans in 2017 lower collections on receivables as more were noncash exchanged for sold receivables favorable changes in accounts payable from vendor payment term renegotiations that were less pronounced than the prior year and increased cash payments of employee bonuses in 2017 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by lower cash payments for income taxes in 2017 driven by our prefunding of postretirement plan benefits following us tax reform enactment on december 22 2017 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 12 billion  for the year  ended december 30 2017  compared to 15 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2016  the decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs as well as lower proceeds from cash settlements on net investment hedges capital expenditures were flat in 2017 compared to 2016 we expect 2018 capital expenditures to be approximately 850 million the expected decrease is primarily attributed to the windup of footprint costs in the us and canada related to our integration program 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 42 billion  for the year  ended december 30 2017  compared to 46 billion  for the year  ended december 31 2016  the decrease was driven by the benefit of fewer dividend payments in 2017 compared to 2016 which more than offset higher net repayments of longterm debt and commercial paper in 2017 compared to 2016 including cash outflows associated with the redemption of our series a preferred stock in 2016 dividend payments were lower in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the absence of the series a preferred stock dividend and the impact of four common stock cash distributions in 2017 compared to five such distributions in 2016 see equity and dividends  for additional information on cash distributions related to common stock and series a preferred stock

net cash provided by operating activities was 26 billion  in 2016 compared to 13 billion  in 2015 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the 2015 merger as well as favorable changes in accounts payable due to payment term extensions from vendor renegotiations the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by lower collections on receivables as more were noncash exchanged for sold receivables as well as unfavorable changes in other current liabilities and to a lesser degree inventories the change in other current liabilities was primarily driven by increased payments in 2016 related to income taxes 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 15 billion  in 2016 compared to net cash used for investing activities of 83 billion  in 2015 the change was primarily driven by increased cash inflows from our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures and lower proceeds from cash settlements on net investment hedges capital expenditures increased to 12 billion  in 2016 primarily due to integration and restructuring activities in the united states the change also reflected cash paid to acquire kraft in 2015 see note 2 merger and acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 merger 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 46 billion  in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 100 billion  in 2015 this decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds of 100 billion from our issuance of common stock to the sponsors in connection with the 2015 merger the series a preferred stock redemption in june 2016 and the impact of five common stock cash distributions in 2016 compared to two such cash distributions in 2015 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from our longterm debt issuances in may 2016 and net proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper which were our primary sources of funding for the series a preferred stock redemption additionally in the prior year we had a benefit from proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt which were largely offset by repayments of longterm debt our cash used for financing activities in 2016 also reflected the impact of one cash distribution related to our series a preferred stock in 2016 compared to five such cash distributions in 2015 see equity and dividends within this item for additional information on cash distributions related to common stock and series a preferred stock 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

of the 16 billion  cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet at december 30 2017  11 billion was held by international subsidiaries 

in the future we could repatriate up to approximately 65 billion of international cash to the us without incurring any additional significant income tax expense our approximately 50 billion of unremitted historic earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was taxed via the us tax reform toll charge in 2017 in connection with us tax reform we have also reassessed our international investment assertions and no longer consider these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested we have made a reasonable estimate of local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings are distributed as a result we have recorded an estimate of 96 million  related to deferred income taxes to reflect local country withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed the remaining amount of up to approximately 15 billion represents intercompany loans and previously taxed income which could be repatriated to the us without incurring any additional significant income tax expense 

total debt 

in 2017 we obtained funding through our us and european commercial paper programs as of december 30 2017  we had 448 million  of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1541  as of december 31 2016  we had 642 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1074  the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the year  ended december 30 2017  was 12 billion 

we maintain our 40 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “senior credit facility” subject to certain conditions we may increase the amount of revolving commitments andor add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to 10 billion our senior credit facility contains customary representations covenants and events of default no amounts were drawn on our senior credit facility at december 30 2017  at december 31 2016  or during the years ended december 30 2017  december 31 2016  and january 3 2016  

in august 2017 we repaid 600 million  aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding senior unsecured loan facility the “term loan facility” accordingly there were no  amounts outstanding on the term loan facility at december 30 2017  at december 31 2016  600 million aggregate principal amount of our term loan facility was outstanding 

our longterm debt including the current portion was 311 billion  at december 30 2017  and 318 billion  at december 31 2016  the decrease in longterm debt was primarily due to our june 2017 repayment of approximately 20 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in the period and our august 2017 repayment of the 600 million  aggregate principal amount term loan facility the decrease was partially offset by approximately 15 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm debt issued in august 2017 our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 30 2017  see note 16 debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we have approximately 25 billion aggregate principal amount and c200 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that will mature in the third quarter of 2018 we expect to fund these longterm debt repayments primarily with new longterm debt issuances cash on hand and cash generated from our operating activities 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

see note 14 financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs and other financing arrangements 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 30 2017  in millions 



 during the second quarter of 2016 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock therefore we no longer pay series a preferred stock dividends see note 17 capital stock  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pension plan contributions were 330 million  in 2017 we estimate that 2018 pension plan contributions will be approximately 50 million  beyond 2018 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including the timing of regulatory approval for the windup of certain nonus pension plans changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated pension plan contributions for 2018 have been excluded from the above table 

postretirement benefit plan contributions were 13 billion  in 2017 including payments of 12 billion to prefund a portion of our us postretirement plan benefits following enactment of us tax reform on december 22 2017 we estimate that 2018 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately 15 million  beyond 2018 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws and regulations tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual postretirement plan asset performance or interest rates or other factors as such estimated postretirement benefit plan contributions for 2018 have been excluded from the above table 

at december 30 2017  the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 428 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table 

equity and dividends 

series a preferred stock dividends 

on june 7 2016 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock accordingly we no longer pay any associated dividends and there were no such dividend payments in 2017 

prior to the redemption we made cash distributions of 180 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 900 million in 2015 our series a preferred stock entitled holders to a 900 annual dividend to be paid in four dividends in arrears on each march 7 june 7 and december 7 in cash in 2015  there were five dividend payments because concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on december 8 2015 we also declared and paid the series a preferred stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on march 7 2016 accordingly there were no cash distributions related to our series a preferred stock in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in only one dividend payment in 2016 prior to redemption 

see note 17 capital stock  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the series a preferred stock 

common stock dividends 

we paid common stock dividends of 29 billion  in 2017 36 billion  in 2016 and 13 billion  in 2015 additionally on february 16 2018 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0625 per share of common stock which is payable on march 23 2018 to shareholders of record on march 9 2018 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 

the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the 2015 merger which was consummated on july 2 2015 and the related equity investments based on the historical results of operations of heinz and kraft see note 1 background and basis of presentation and note 2 merger and acquisition to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 merger 

the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended january 3 2016  is based on the historical financial statements of heinz and kraft after giving effect to the 2015 merger related equity investments and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to this unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income 

the kraft heinz statement of income information for the year ended january 3 2016  was derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the historical kraft statement of income includes information for the six months ended june 27 2015 derived from kraft’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 7 2016 and information for the period from june 27 2015 to july 2 2015 derived from kraft’s books and records 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 merger had been consummated on december 30 2013 the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year and combine the historical results of heinz and kraft this is consistent with internal management reporting the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments 

 the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition we utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 merger date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed this allocation was final as of july 3 2016 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with sec regulation sx article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results in addition the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies operating efficiencies cost savings or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 merger 

the historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are 1 directly attributable to the transaction 2 factually supportable and 3 are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company as a result under sec regulation sx article 11 certain expenses such as deal costs and noncash costs related to the fair value stepup of inventory “inventory stepup costs” if applicable are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented in contrast under the asc 805 presentation in note 2 merger and acquisition to the consolidated financial statements these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results

in millions 

unaudited 

adjustments included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are as follows 

 we calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 385 weighted average statutory tax rate for the periods presented 

additionally for 2015 we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the kraft heinz weighted average number of basic shares outstanding which included the sponsors shares and the converted kraft shares weighted for the period from the 2015 merger through the year ended january 3 2016 and the sponsors shares as converted and the converted kraft shares both weighted from the beginning of the year through the 2015 merger date we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding including dilutive securities related to kraft heinz the kraft heinz diluted eps calculation did not include these securities as kraft heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were antidilutive 

nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures we provide in this report should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap we have presented organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps which are considered nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way these measures are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as net sales net incomeloss diluted earnings per common share “eps” or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

management uses these nongaap financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures ie organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures 

organic net sales is defined as net sales excluding when they occur the impact of acquisitions currency divestitures and a 53rd week of shipments we calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate with the exception of venezuela following our june 28 2015 currency devaluation for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate organic net sales for any period prior to the 2015 merger date includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 organic net sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome net and provision forbenefit from income taxes in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of depreciation and amortization excluding integration and restructuring expenses including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses lossesgains on the sale of a business nonmonetary currency devaluation eg remeasurement gains and losses and equity award compensation expense excluding integration and restructuring expenses adjusted ebitda for any period prior to the 2015 merger date includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses lossesgains on the sale of a business nonmonetary currency devaluation eg remeasurement gains and losses and us tax reform and including when they occur adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis adjusted eps for any period prior to the 2015 merger date includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 we believe adjusted eps provides important comparability of underlying operating results allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis

reportable segments 

we manage and report our operating results through four  segments we have three  reportable segments defined by geographic region united states canada and europe our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as “rest of world” rest of world is comprised of two  operating segments latin america and asia pacific middle east and africa “amea” 

in 2016 we reorganized our segments to reflect the following   

 these changes are reflected in all historical periods presented and did not have a material impact on our financial statements   

see note 18 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these changes and for our financial information by segment 

net sales by product category 

in 2016 we reorganized the products within our product categories to reflect how we manage our business we have reflected this change for all historical periods presented the product categories that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented were 



we completed the 2015 merger on july 2 2015 as a result 2016 was the first full year of combined kraft and heinz results 2015 included a full year of heinz results and post2015 merger results of kraft and 2014 included the results of heinz only the yearoveryear fluctuations in the percentages above are primarily driven by including kraft’s results 

sales and customers 

our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers agents and distributors to chain wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies our largest customer walmart stores inc represented approximately 22 of our net sales in 2016  approximately 20  of our net sales in 2015 and approximately 10  of our net sales in 2014 

additionally we have significant customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers individually are material to our consolidated business in 2016 the five largest customers in our united states segment accounted for approximately 49 of united states segment sales the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 76 of canada segment sales and the five largest customers in our europe segment accounted for approximately 31 of our europe segment sales 

raw materials and packaging 

we manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw food materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat and other goods to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status andor have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy and agricultural programs 

the most significant cost components of our cheese products are dairy commodities including milk and cheese we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components in our meat business include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on world markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and world markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of price 

our risk management group works with our procurement teams to monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources our risk management group uses a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor any changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and generic products in addition to retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation brand recognition and loyalty service the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs distribution shelf space merchandising support and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

trademarks and intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms significant trademarks by segment based on net sales at december 31 2016 were

we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

we sell some products under brands we license from third parties including capri sun  packaged drink pouches for sale in the united states tgi fridays  frozen snacks and appetizers in the united states and canada  mccafe  ground whole bean and ondemand single cup coffees in the united states and canada  taco bell home originals mexicanstyle food products in us grocery stores and weight watchers smart ones  frozen entrées snacks and desserts in the united states and canada in our agreements with mondelēz international inc “mondelēz international” we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for an agreed period of time following the spinoff of kraft from mondelēz international in 2012 

research and development 

our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives 

 research and development expense was approximately 120 million  in 2016 105 million in 2015 and 58 million in 2014 

seasonality 

although crops constituting some of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis most of our products are produced throughout the year 

seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products including holidays changes in seasons or other annual events these factors influence our quarterly sales operating income and cash flows therefore it is most meaningful to compare quarterly results to the same quarters of prior years 

employees 

we had approximately 41000 employees as of december 31 2016  

regulation 

our business operations including the production storage distribution sale display advertising marketing labeling quality and safety of our products occupational safety and health practices transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the united states in markets in which our products are manufactured distributed or sold 

we are required to comply with a variety of us and canadian laws and regulations including but not limited to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and various state laws governing food safety the food safety modernization act the safe food for canadians act the occupational safety and health act various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices including those related to equal employment opportunity such as the equal employment opportunity act and the national labor relations act customs and foreign trade laws and regulations and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools we are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of north america including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety health and safety anticorruption and data privacy in our business dealings we are also required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act and various other anticorruption regulations in the regions in which we operate we rely on legal and operational compliance programs as well as inhouse and outside counsel to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business 

environmental regulation 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws concerning the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations 

in the united states where a significant portion of our business operates these laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions and legislation related to our current operations and certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability we do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition 

as of december 31 2016  we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves 

foreign operations 

in 2016 we generated a significant amount of our net sales from operations outside of the united states and sold our products in approximately 190 countries and territories for additional information about our foreign operations see note 18 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements refer to item 2 properties  for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states including currency risk see risk factors  in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings we compete based on product innovation price product quality service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including changing consumer preferences that may adversely impact the market for our products these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may suffer 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition across the globe our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing negative attention on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us our quality and safety our environmental or social impacts or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation in addition we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline 

we are a global company with sales or operations in approximately 190  countries and territories approximately 30 of our 2016 net revenues were generated outside of the united states as a result we are subject to risks inherent in global operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include 

 in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovation 

consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or impact on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories increase our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food and beverage industry’s overall growth is generally linked to population growth our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016 the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worth 

commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products tomatoes cucumbers potatoes onions other fruits and vegetables spices flour and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins cardboard glass plastic metal paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as water and natural gas to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations furthermore the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in particular the success of the continued integration of kraft and heinz will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team’s attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness 

we have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives including our integration program as defined below that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of our cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute on those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production and profitability could decrease 

changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performance 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing more favorable terms increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets if we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact us 

we have significant sales to certain significant customers there can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control a significant deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategy 

we plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international distribution channels consumer demand behavior taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations 

changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food and beverage production storage distribution sales and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

federal state and local governments and administrative bodies within the us which represents a majority of our operations are considering a variety of broad tax trade and other regulatory reforms for example an increase in tariff or restrictive trade activities around the world could negatively impact our ability to succeed in certain markets similarly changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” multijurisdictional plan of action to address “base erosion and profit sharing” could impact our effective tax rate it is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of these proposed or future changes but these changes could have a material impact on our business 

legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

as a large food and beverage company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and operating results in addition the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration misbranding tampering or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time 

we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather raw material shortages natural disasters fire or explosion political unrest terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations these disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

the failure to integrate successfully the business and operations of kraft and heinz in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results 

while no material disruptions occurred during the first full year of integration there can be no assurances that the kraft and heinz businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the the loss of customers the disruption of ongoing businesses unexpected integration issues or higher than expected integration costs it is also possible that the overall postmerger integration process will take longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed as we continue to integrate the operations of kraft and heinz in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2015 merger 

 in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the integration of the businesses of kraft and heinz and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt our business 

we may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate acquisition candidates alliances or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions and we may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities as well as to satisfy other legal requirements 

to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances or joint ventures or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the fcpa currency rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do business 

our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business such conditions and factors include changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in food and drug laws accounting standards and critical accounting estimates taxation requirements and environmental laws other factors impacting our operations in the united states venezuela russia and other international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions currency exchange rates currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our financial results for further information on venezuela see note 15 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation to the consolidated financial statements 

volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

furthermore we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with unionrepresented employees both in and outside of the united states 

volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our operating results and net income 

we use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products coffee beans meat products wheat corn products soybean oils sugar and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income resulting in volatility in both gross profits and net income we report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we report these gains and losses in the unallocated corporate items line in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying products at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

our net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

we derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah and chinese renminbi since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyberattacks and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions reputational damage transaction errors processing inefficiencies the leakage of confidential information and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations damage to the reputation and credibility of the company loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net operating revenues in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or consumers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers or regulators operate 

we may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers and regulators natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations while we insure against certain business interruption risks we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters to the extent we are unable to or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt the existing debt together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness could 

 in addition our credit agreement and indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants will limit our ability to among other things incur or permit to exist certain liens or our ability to merge or consolidate with or into another company in each case with customary exceptions there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

the creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default if we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments the creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future 

the sponsors own approximately 51 of our common stock six of our 11 directors had been directors of heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 merger and remained directors of kraft heinz pursuant to the merger agreement in addition some of our executive officers including bernardo hees our chief executive officer are partners of 3g capital one of the sponsors as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our board of directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock the directors designated by the sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional capital stock incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

kraft heinz 3g global food holdings lp and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g global food holdings lp and berkshire hathaway which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of the closing of the 2015 merger registrable shares represented approximately 51 of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a “lockup” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made upon registration of such shares with the sec in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement registration and sales of our common stock effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement will increase the number of shares being sold in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and may be limited by our debt agreements limitations under delaware law 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law and other factors the board of directors deems relevant the board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we may not generate us earnings and profits sufficient for distributions paid to stockholders to be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes 

in 2016distributions made on our stock including the redemption of   83 billion of our 900 cumulative compounding preferred stock series a “series a preferred stock” which we believe will be treated as a dividend distribution for us federal income tax purposes significantly exceeded our earnings and profits as determined under us tax principles and therefore only a portion of our regular 2016 quarterly dividends was treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes for purposes of us federal income tax insofar as our earnings and profits are not sufficient these distributions would be treated as a return of capital to each stockholder up to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis if a stockholder does not have sufficient tax basis these distributions could result in taxable gains to the stockholder although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends we cannot currently anticipate whether our future earnings and profits will be sufficient for all or a portion of future year distributions to be treated as dividends as determined under us tax principles stockholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends including distributions in excess of our earnings and profits

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are routinely involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inquiries inspections or investigations “legal matters” arising in the ordinary course of our business 

on april 1 2015 the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” filed a formal complaint against mondelēz international formerly known as kraft foods inc and kraft in the us district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division related to activities involving the trading of december 2011 wheat futures contracts the complaint alleges that mondelēz international and kraft 1 manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011 2 violated position limit levels for wheat futures and 3 engaged in noncompetitive trades by trading both sides of exchangeforphysical chicago board of trade wheat contracts as previously disclosed by kraft these activities arose prior to the october 1 2012 spinoff of kraft by mondelēz international to its shareholders and involve the business now owned and operated by mondelēz international or its affiliates the separation and distribution agreement between kraft and mondelēz international dated as of september 27 2012 governs the allocation of liabilities between mondelēz international and kraft and accordingly mondelēz international will predominantly bear the costs of this matter and any monetary penalties or other payments that the cftc may impose we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business 

while we cannot predict with certainty the results of legal matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the legal matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies 

note 1 background and basis of presentation  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation   

the consolidated financial statements include the kraft heinz company as well as our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

revenue recognition   

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors 

advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions   

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions 

advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses “sga” we recorded advertising expense of 708 million   in 2016   464 million   in 2015 and 241 million   in 2014 for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information   

consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information   

goodwill and intangible assets 

the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets was 974 billion  at december 31 2016  and 989 billion  at january 3 2016  these balances are largely attributable to asset valuations performed in connection with the 2013 merger and the 2015 merger see note 2 merger and acquisition  and note 6 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional information 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value   

we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016 no impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test however we noted that one reporting unit within the europe segment had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of less than 10  the goodwill carrying value of this reporting unit was 48 million  as of april 4 2016 our goodwill impairment testing date  in addition there was no  impairment of indefinitelived intangibles as a result of our testing however we noted that seven  brands each had excess fair value over its carrying value of less than 10  these brands had an aggregate carrying value of 61 billion  at april 4 2016 our indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing date  of the 61 billion  aggregate carrying value 56 billion  was attributable to velveeta  lunchables  maxwell   house  and cracker   barrel  

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate 

postemployment benefit plans 

we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and sga   

for our postretirement benefit plans our 2017 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 63 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 49 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2022 and 2027 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects increasedecrease in cost and obligation as of december 31 2016 in millions 



our 2017 discount rate assumption is 40 for service cost and 31 for interest cost for our postretirement plans our 2017 discount rate assumption is 43 for service cost and 36 for interest cost for our us pension plans and 32 for service cost and 23 for interest cost for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

in 2016 we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension costbenefit and net postretirement benefit plans cost resulting in a decrease to these cost components we now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

our 2017 expected rate of return on plan assets is 57 for our us pension plans and 48 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2017 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basis point change in our discount rate or a 100basispoint change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effects increasedecrease in cost as of december 31 2016  in millions 



income taxes 

we compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 

we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position   

we have a significant amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested we do not recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or which may be remitted tax free in certain situations we do recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries which are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we intend to continue to reinvest the majority of our foreign subsidiary earnings to support our priorities for growth in international markets and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations if we decided at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us we would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on the applicable us tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings we believe it is not practicable because there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact this uncertainty results from the significant judgment required to analyze the amount of foreign tax credits attributable to the earnings the ability to use foreign tax credits to offset the us tax on the earnings the potential timing of any distributions as well as the local withholding tax and other indirect tax consequences that may arise due to the potential distribution of these earnings 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 background and basis of presentation  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements 

contingencies 

see note 16 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities 

markets for our key commodities were volatile in 2016 we expect commodity cost volatility to continue in 2017 we manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies as a result of these risk management strategies our commodity costs may not immediately correlate with market price trends 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities our revolving credit facility as defined below our securitization programs and our commercial paper program will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs expected integration program and restructuring expenditures planned capital expenditures contributions to our postemployment benefit plans future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we intend to use our cash on hand and our commercial paper program for daily funding requirements overall we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our shortterm or longterm liquidity 

cash flow activity for 2016 compared to 2015 

net cash provided byused for operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 52 billion  in 2016 compared to 25 billion  in 2015 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the 2015 merger 

changes in current assets and liabilities were favorable in 2016 driven primarily by favorable changes in accounts payable and receivables changes in accounts payable were favorable due to payment term extensions from vendor renegotiations changes in receivables were favorable primarily as a result of increasing our us securitization program in may 2016 these favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes in other current liabilities and to a lesser degree inventories the change in other current liabilities was driven primarily by increased payments in 2016 related to income taxes 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 11 billion  in 2016 compared to 97 billion  in 2015 the decrease in cash used for investing activities was driven by payments to acquire kraft in connection with the 2015 merger the decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures to 12 billion  in 2016 which was primarily due to integration and restructuring activities in the united states we expect 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately 12 billion including capital expenditures required for our ongoing integration and restructuring activities cash used for investing activities also reflected lower proceeds from cash settlements of net investment hedges in 2016 than in 2015 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 46 billion  in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 102 billion  in 2015 this decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds of 100 billion from our issuance of common stock to the sponsors in connection with the 2015 merger the series a preferred stock redemption in june 2016 and the impact of five common stock cash distributions in 2016 compared to two such cash distributions in 2015 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from our longterm debt issuances in may 2016 and net proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper which were our primary sources of funding for the series a preferred stock redemption additionally in the prior year we had a benefit from proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt which were largely offset by repayments of longterm debt our cash used for financing activities in 2016 also reflected the impact of one cash distribution related to our series a preferred stock in 2016 compared to five such cash distributions in 2015 see equity and dividends within this item for further information on cash distributions related to common stock and series a preferred stock 

cash flow activity for 2015 compared to 2014 

net cash provided byused for operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 25 billion  in 2015 compared to 21 billion  in 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income in 2015 as a result of the 2015 merger partially offset by an increase in pension contributions and working capital improvements that were less pronounced than 2014 

net cash provided byused for investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 97 billion  in 2015 compared to 349 million  in 2014 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by our payments to acquire kraft and also included proceeds from our net investment hedges of 488 million capital expenditures were 648 million in 2015 

net cash provided byused for financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 102 billion  in 2015 compared to net cash used of 18 billion  in 2014 the 102 billion of cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by 100 billion proceeds from issuance of common stock to the sponsors our cash provided by financing activities also included 148 billion proceeds from issuances of longterm debt partially offset by longterm debt repayments of 123 billion and the payment of our quarterly common stock cash dividend starting in the third quarter of 2015 additionally related to the series a preferred stock we made cash distributions of 900 million in 2015 which reflected five dividend payments compared to cash distributions of 720 million in 2014 which reflected four dividend payments 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

at december 31 2016  approximately 13 billion of cash and cash equivalents were held by international subsidiaries 

we have provided for a deferred tax liability of 21 million for undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we consider the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the united states to be indefinitely reinvested for those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested our intent is to reinvest these earnings in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our united states cash requirements if we decide at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the united states we would be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on the applicable united states tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid 

further certain previously taxed earnings have not yet been remitted and certain intercompany loans have not yet been repaid as a result in future periods we believe that we could remit approximately 28 billion of cash to the united states without incurring any additional material tax expense 

total debt 

in 2016 together with kraft heinz foods company we commenced a commercial paper program as of december 31 2016  we had 642 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1074  during the year ended december 31 2016 the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was 12 billion we had no commercial paper outstanding at january 3 2016  

we maintain our senior credit facilities comprised of our 40 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and a 600 million senior unsecured loan facility the “term loan facility” and together with the revolving credit facility the “senior credit facilities” subject to certain conditions we may increase the amount of revolving commitments andor add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to 10 billion our senior credit facilities contain customary representations covenants and events of default at december 31 2016  600 million aggregate principal amount of our term loan facility was outstanding no amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2016  at january 3 2016 or during the years ended   december 31 2016  and january 3 2016   

our longterm debt including the current portion was 318 billion  at december 31 2016 and 252 billion  at january 3 2016 the increase during the period was driven by new issuances of longterm debt during the second quarter of 2016 we used the net proceeds from these issuances primarily to redeem all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock for 83 billion our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default and we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 31 2016  

see note 11 debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

see note 13 financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  in millions 



 during the second quarter of 2016 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock therefore we no longer pay series a preferred stock dividends see note 12 capital stock  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pension contributions were 344 million  in 2016 we estimate that 2017 pension contributions will be approximately 150 million  to our us plans and approximately 35 million  to our nonus plans beyond 2017 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our contributions depend on many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates and other factors as such expected pension contributions for 2017 have been excluded from the above table 

at december 31 2016  the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 395 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table 

equity and dividends 

series a preferred stock 

on june 7 2016 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock therefore we no longer pay series a preferred stock dividends 

prior to the redemption we made cash distributions of 180 million  in 2016 compared to 900 million  in 2015 and 720 million  in 2014 our series a preferred stock entitled holders to a 900 annual dividend to be paid in four dividends in arrears on each march 7 june 7 september 7 and december 7 in cash in 2015 there were five dividend payments because concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on december 8 2015 we also declared and paid the series a preferred stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on march 7 2016 accordingly there were no cash distributions related to our series a preferred stock in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in only one dividend payment in 2016 prior to redemption 

see note 12 capital stock  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the series a preferred stock 

common stock dividends 

we paid common stock dividends of 36 billion  in 2016 and 13 billion  in 2015 no common stock dividends were paid in 2014 additionally on february 15 2017 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 060 per share of common stock which is payable on march 17 2017 to shareholders of record on march 3 2017 the present annualized dividend rate is 240 per share of common stock 

the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 

the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the 2015 merger which was consummated on july 2 2015 and the related equity investments based on the historical results of operations of heinz and kraft see note 1 background and basis of presentation and note 2 merger and acquisition to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 merger 

the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the years  ended january 3 2016  and december 28 2014  are based on the historical financial statements of heinz and kraft after giving effect to the 2015 merger related equity investments and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income 

the kraft heinz statement of income information for the year ended january 3 2016  was derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the historical kraft statement of income includes information for the six months ended june 27 2015 derived from kraft’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 7 2016 and information for the period from june 27 2015 to july 2 2015 derived from kraft’s books and records 

the historical heinz statement of income information for the year ended december 28 2014 was derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the historical kraft statement of income information for the year ended december 28 2014 was derived from its consolidated financial statements included in kraft’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 27 2014 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 merger had been consummated on december 30 2013 the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year and combine the historical results of heinz and kraft this is consistent with internal management reporting the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments 



the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition we utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 merger date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed this allocation was final as of july 3 2016 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with sec regulation sx article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results in addition the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies operating efficiencies cost savings or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 merger 

the historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are 1 directly attributable to the transaction 2 factually supportable and 3 are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company as a result under sec regulation sx article 11 certain expenses such as deal costs and noncash costs related to the fair value stepup of inventory “inventory stepup costs” if applicable are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented in contrast under the asc 805 presentation in note 2 merger and acquisition to the consolidated financial statements these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results

 summary of pro forma adjustments 

in millions 

unaudited 

adjustments included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are as follows 

 we calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 385 weighted average statutory tax rate for the periods presented 

additionally for 2015 we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the kraft heinz weighted average number of basic shares outstanding which included the sponsors shares and the converted kraft shares weighted for the period from the 2015 merger through the year ended january 3 2016 and the sponsors shares as converted and the converted kraft shares both weighted from the beginning of the year through the 2015 merger date we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding including dilutive securities related to kraft heinz the kraft heinz diluted eps calculation did not include these securities as kraft heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were antidilutive 

for 2014 we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding heinz’s historical weighted average number of basic shares outstanding the 500 million shares issued to the sponsors in connection with their equity investments after giving effect to the preclosing heinz conversion ratio of 0443332 and the historical weighted average number 

of basic shares of kraft which were converted on a 11 basis into shares of kraft heinz we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding including dilutive securities related to historical heinz the historical heinz diluted eps calculation did not include these securities as historical heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were antidilutive 

nongaap financial measures 

our nongaap financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap we have presented organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps which are considered nongaap financial measures the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way these measures are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as net sales net incomeloss diluted earnings per common share “eps” or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

management uses these nongaap financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures ie organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures 

organic net sales is defined as net sales excluding when they occur the impact of acquisitions currency divestitures and a 53rd week of shipments we calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year’s exchange rate with the exception of venezuela following our june 28 2015 currency devaluation for which we calculate the previous year’s results using the current year’s exchange rate organic net sales for any period prior to the 2015 merger date includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 organic net sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome net provision forbenefit from income taxes in addition to these adjustments we exclude when they occur the impacts of depreciation and amortization excluding integration and restructuring expenses including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses lossesgains on the sale of a business nonmonetary currency devaluation eg remeasurement gains and losses and equity award compensation expense excluding integration and restructuring expenses adjusted ebitda for any period prior to the 2015 merger date includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 adjusted ebitda is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations 

adjusted eps is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding when they occur the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized lossesgains on commodity hedges impairment losses lossesgains on the sale of a business and nonmonetary currency devaluation eg remeasurement gains and losses and including when they occur adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis adjusted eps for any period prior to the 2015 merger date includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 we believe adjusted eps provides important comparability of underlying operating results allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices foreign exchange rates interest rates and production costs we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results we maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates see note 1 background and basis of presentation  and note 14 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures 

by policy we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

effect of hypothetical 10 fluctuation in market prices   

the potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts crosscurrency and swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in commodity prices currency rates and swap rates would be in millions 



the effect of a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in market prices on certain of our derivative contracts as of january 3 2016 was revised to reflect a correction to the potential gain or loss on fair values including an increase of 36 million related to crosscurrency swap contracts and an increase of 9 million related to foreign currency contracts 

it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items in relation to foreign currency contracts this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities

on july 2 2015 the “2015 merger date” through a series of transactions we consummated the merger of kraft foods group inc “kraft” with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of hj heinz holding corporation “heinz” the “2015 merger” at the closing of the 2015 merger heinz was renamed the kraft heinz company and h j heinz company changed its name to kraft heinz foods company while kraft heinz was organized as a delaware corporation in 2013 as heinz both kraft and heinz have been pioneers in the food industry for over 100 years

see note 1 background and basis of presentation and note 2 merger and acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the 2015 merger and the 2013 merger 

periods presented 

the 2013 merger established a new accounting basis for heinz accordingly the consolidated financial statements present both predecessor and successor periods which relate to the accounting periods preceding and succeeding the completion of the 2013 merger the predecessor and successor periods are separated by a vertical line on the face of the consolidated financial statements to highlight the fact that the financial information for such periods has been prepared under two different historicalcost bases of accounting   

additionally on october 21 2013 our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal yearend from the sunday closest to april 30 to the sunday closest to december 31 in 2013 as a result of the change in fiscal yearend the 2013 merger and the creation of hawk there are three 2013 reporting periods as described below

 the “predecessor h j heinz company period” includes but is not limited to   

 reportable segments

see note 20 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements for financial information by segment 

net sales by product category 

product categories that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net sales for the years ended january 3 2016 and december 28 2014 the 2013 successor period the 2013 predecessor period and fiscal 2013 were 



sales and customers 

our products are sold through our own sales organizations and through independent brokers agents and distributors to chain wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies for the year ended january 3 2016 walmart stores inc our largest customer represented approximately 20 of our net sales for the year ended december 28 2014 the 2013 successor period the 2013 predecessor period and fiscal 2013 walmart stores inc represented approximately 10 of our net sales additionally we have significant customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers individually are material to our consolidated business for the year ended january 3 2016 the five largest customers in our united states segment accounted for approximately 45 of united states segment sales the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 75 of canada segment sales and the five largest customers in our europe segment accounted for approximately 35 of our europe segment sales 

raw materials and packaging 

we manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw food materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat and other goods to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing 

requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status andor have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy and agricultural programs 

the most significant cost components of our cheese products are dairy commodities including milk and cheese we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components in our meat business include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on world markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and world markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of price 

our risk management group works with our procurement teams to monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources our risk management group uses a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor any changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measures 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and generic products in addition to retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation brand recognition and loyalty service the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs distribution shelf space merchandising support and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

trademarks and intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business and are among our most valuable assets depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms some of our significant trademarks by segment include 



additionally we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

we sell some products under brands we license from third parties including capri sun  packaged drink pouches for sale in the united states tgi friday’s  frozen snacks and appetizers in the united states and canada  mccafe  ground whole bean and ondemand single cup coffees in the united states and canada  taco bell home originals mexicanstyle food products in us grocery stores and weight watchers smart ones  frozen entrees snacks and desserts in the united states and canada in our agreements with mondelēz international inc “mondelēz international” formerly known as kraft foods inc we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions for an agreed period of time following the spinoff of kraft from mondelēz international in 2012 

research and development 

our research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives 

 research and development expense was   105 million   in the year ended january 3 2016 58 million   in the year ended december 28 2014   53 million  in the 2013 successor period   10 million  in the 2013 predecessor period and 93 million  in fiscal 2013   

seasonality 

although crops constituting some of our raw food ingredients are harvested on a seasonal basis most of our products are produced throughout the year 

seasonal factors inherent in our business change the demand for products including holidays changes in seasons or other annual events these factors influence our quarterly sales operating income and cash flows therefore it is most meaningful to compare quarterly results to the same quarters of prior years 

employees 

we had approximately 42000 employees as of january 3 2016 

regulation 

our business operations including the production storage distribution sale display advertising marketing labeling quality and safety of our products occupational safety and health practices transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the united states in markets in which our products are manufactured distributed or sold 

we are required to comply with a variety of us and canadian laws and regulations including but not limited to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and various state laws governing food safety the food safety modernization act the safe food for canadians act the occupational safety and health act various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices including those related to equal employment opportunity such as the equal employment opportunity act and the national labor relations act customs and foreign trade laws and regulations and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools we are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of north america including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety health and safety anticorruption and data privacy in our business dealings we are also required to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act we rely on legal and operational compliance programs as well as inhouse and outside counsel to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business 

environmental regulation 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws concerning the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the operation of facilities in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations 

in the united states where a significant portion of our business operates these laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party 

we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions and legislation related to our current operations and certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability we do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition 

as of january 3 2016 we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition 

however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reserves 

foreign operations 

for the year ended january 3 2016 we generated a significant amount of our net sales from operations outside of the united states and sell our products in more than 190 countries and territories  for additional information about our foreign operations see note 20 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements refer to item 2 properties  for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities also for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states including currency risk see risk factors  in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings we compete based on product innovation price product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including changing consumer preferences that may adversely impact the market for our products these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may suffer 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing negative attention on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

in nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

the consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may consolidate resulting in fewer customers for our business consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovation 

consumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or impact on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories increase our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories 

the food and beverage industry’s overall growth is generally linked to population growth our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2015 prior to completion of the 2015 merger   

the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value   

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate   

an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worth 

commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products tomatoes cucumbers potatoes onions other fruits and vegetables spices flour and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins cardboard glass plastic metal paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as water and natural gas to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations additionally the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in particular the success of the continued integration of kraft and heinz will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating kraft and heinz to hiring suitable replacements in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness 

we have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives including our integration program that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefit of our cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute on those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production and profitability could decrease 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact us 

we have significant sales to certain significant customers there can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

in addition the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control a significant deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategy 

we plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international distribution channels consumer demand behavior taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations 

changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food and beverage production storage distribution sales and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

as a large food and beverage company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and operating results 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration misbranding tampering or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather raw material shortages natural disasters fire or explosion terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations these disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

the failure to integrate successfully the business and operations of kraft and heinz in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results 

prior to the 2015 merger kraft and heinz operated as independent companies there can be no assurances that these businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key historical kraft or heinz employees the loss of customers the disruption of ongoing businesses unexpected integration issues or higher than expected integration costs it is also possible that the overall postmerger integration process will take longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed as we continue to integrate the operations of kraft and heinz in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2015 merger 

 in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the integration of the businesses of kraft and heinz and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt our business 

we may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate acquisition candidates alliances or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions and we may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities as well as to satisfy other legal requirements in addition to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances or joint ventures or other developments outside our core geography or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act currency rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do business 

our performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business such conditions and factors include changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in food and drug laws accounting standards and critical accounting estimates taxation requirements and environmental laws other factors impacting our operations in the united states venezuela russia and other international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions currency exchange rates currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our financial results for further information on venezuela see note 17 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation to the consolidated financial statements 

volatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business 

changes in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our operating results and net income 

we use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products coffee beans meat products wheat corn products soybean oils sugar and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income resulting in volatility in both gross profits and net income we report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we report these gains and losses in the unallocated corporate items line in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying 

products at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments 

our net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

we derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah and chinese renminbi since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are significantly dependent on information technology 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayed 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliers 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers or regulators operate 

we may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers and regulators natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations while we insure against certain business interruption risks we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters to the extent we are unable to or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chain 

our indebtedness levels could impact our business 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions including reducing spending on marketing retail trade incentives advertising and product innovation reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default if we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments the creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

our indebtedness could also impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes especially if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward in addition our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors that could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the food and beverage industry could be impaired making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions in our industry or in our business 

our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and make strategic acquisitions limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our existing indebtedness 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt the existing debt together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness could 

 15 

 in addition the credit agreement and indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants will limit our ability to among other things incur or permit to exist certain liens or merge or consolidate with or into another company in each case with customary exceptions 

the terms of our series a preferred stock provide for a 900 annual dividend payment of which could adversely affect our results of operations and could result in a net loss 

the terms of our series a preferred stock provide for a 900 annual dividend these dividend payments resulted in a net loss attributable to kraft heinz’s common shareholders in our fiscal year ended january 3 2016 despite having otherwise generated 634 million  in net income during that period to the extent dividend payments to holders of the 900 series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series a preferred stock” exceed our net income before taking into account such payments in any fiscal year a net loss would result even if such dividend payments do not exceed our net income the payment obligation will have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition the ability to pay these dividend payments is also subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control while we currently intend to refinance the series a preferred stock in 2016 there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully undertake such refinancing 

the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future 

the sponsors together with employees who were heinz stockholders prior to the consummation of the 2015 merger own approximately 51 of our common stock six of our 11 directors had been directors of heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 merger and remained directors of kraft heinz pursuant to the merger agreement in addition some of our executive officers including bernardo hees our chief executive officer are partners of 3g capital one of the sponsors as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our board of directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock the directors designated by the sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional capital stock incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

kraft heinz 3g global food holdings lp and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g global food holdings lp and berkshire hathaway inc which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of the closing of the 2015 merger registrable shares represented approximately 51 of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a “lockup” or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made upon registration of such shares with the sec in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement registration and sales of our common stock effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement will increase the number of shares being sold in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stock 

our ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and may be limited by our debt agreements limitations under delaware law and the rights of holders of series a preferred stock 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial 

condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law the rights of holders of shares of the series a preferred stock to receive dividends in respect of such shares prior to us being permitted to pay any dividends in respect of our common stock and other factors the board of directors deems relevant the board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occur 

we may not generate us earnings and profits sufficient for distributions paid to shareholders to be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes 

although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends our earnings as determined under us tax principles may not be sufficient for all or a portion of these distributions to be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes if our earnings and profits are not sufficient these distributions would be treated as a return of capital to each shareholder up to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis if a shareholder does not have sufficient tax basis these distributions could result in taxable gains to the shareholder shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends including distributions in excess of our earnings and profits

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are routinely involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inquiries inspections or investigations “legal matters” arising in the ordinary course of our business   

on april 1 2015 the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” filed a formal complaint against mondelēz international and kraft in the us district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division related to activities involving the trading of december 2011 wheat futures contracts the complaint alleges that mondelēz international and kraft 1 manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011 2 violated position limit levels for wheat futures and 3 engaged in noncompetitive trades by trading both sides of exchangeforphysical chicago board of trade wheat contracts as previously disclosed by kraft these activities arose prior to the october 1 2012 spinoff of kraft by mondelēz international to its shareholders and involve the business now owned and operated by mondelēz international or its affiliates the separation and distribution agreement between kraft and mondelēz international dated as of september 27 2012 governs the allocation of liabilities between mondelēz international and kraft and accordingly mondelēz international will predominantly bear the costs of this matter and any monetary penalties or other payments that the cftc may impose we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business   

as previously disclosed   six  lawsuits were filed in connection with the 2015 merger against kraft members of its board of directors heinz kite merger sub corp and kite merger sub llc the plaintiffs in these matters alleged among other things that i the form s4 contained material omissions and misleading statements and ii the members of the kraft board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the 2015 merger the plaintiffs sought among other things injunctive relief and damages as disclosed in kraft’s form 8k filed on june 24 2015 on june 23 2015 kraft entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs providing for the settlement of all of these lawsuits on october 28 2015 we executed a stipulation of settlement with the plaintiffs formalizing the terms of the memorandum of understanding on november 10 2015 the us district court for the eastern district of virginia issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement and providing for notice to kraft’s shareholders regarding the proposed settlement on february 18 2016 the court held a hearing regarding the proposed settlement the court indicated that it intends to approve the settlement and requested that plaintiffs’ counsel provide certain additional information we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations   

while we cannot predict with certainty the results of legal matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the legal matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

2013 periods presented 

in item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for purposes of comparing the results for the year ended december 28 2014 to the prior year we compare our year ended december 28 2014 to the 2013 successor period and the unaudited predecessor period from december 24 2012 through june 7 2013 we believe this is the most appropriate way to compare our full year 2014 results to a comparable prior year period all data for the unaudited predecessor period december 24 2012 to june 7 2013 is derived from our unaudited consolidated financial information which is presented in the tables below and represents a different period than the predecessor period april 29 2013 to june 7 2013 included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data    

53 rd  week 

our year end date for financial reporting purposes is the sunday closest to december 31 as a result we occasionally have a 53 rd  week in a fiscal year our year ended january 3 2016 includes a 53 rd  week of activity  additionally the 2013 successor period and the unaudited predecessor period from december 24 2012 through june 7 2013 combined is equal to 53 weeks of activity 

integration and restructuring expenses 

related to integration and restructuring we recorded expenses of 10 billion in the year ended january 3 2016 expenses of 637 million  in the year ended december 28 2014 expenses of 411 million  in the 2013 successor period a benefit of 6 million  in the 2013 predecessor period and expenses of 1 million  in fiscal 2013 

these expenses include our multiyear 19 billion  integration program which we announced following the 2015 merger the costs primarily include organization costs including cash and noncash severance footprint costs to exit facilities and other costs incurred as a direct result of restructuring activities related to the 2015 merger additionally we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 11 billion related to the integration program and have recognized 225 million in the year ended january 3 2016 the integration program is designed to reduce costs integrate and optimize our combined organization and is expected to achieve 15 billion of pretax savings by 2017 primarily benefiting the united states and canada segments we realized approximately 125 million of pretax savings in the year ended january 3 2016 

these expenses also include costs associated with other restructuring activities focused primarily on workforce reductions and factory closures and consolidations in relation to the 2013 merger

results of continuing operations for year ended january 3 2016 compared to year ended december 28 2014 

due to the size of krafts business relative to the size of heinzs business prior to the 2015 merger and for purposes of comparability the results of continuing operations for year ended january 3 2016 compared to year ended december 28 2014 include certain unaudited pro forma results adjusted to assume that kraft and heinz were a combined company for both periods presented which includes combining historical results reflecting preliminary purchase accounting adjustments and aligning accounting policies for both historical periods presented these pro forma adjustments impacted the consolidated results as well as our united states and canada segments in addition we include certain nongaap financial measures derived from these unaudited pro forma results these pro forma adjustments and nongaap financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decisionmaking by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations for additional information and reconciliations from our consolidated financial statements see supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and nongaap financial measures

 22 

activities and a 227 million expense related to the termination of certain interest rate swap contracts the remaining increase was due to the assumption of 86 billion of krafts longterm debt obligations in the 2015 merger partially offset by interest savings following our 2015 refinancing activities 

 diluted loss per share increased 017 to a diluted loss per share of 034 in the year ended january 3 2016 the increase in diluted loss per share was driven primarily by the net income factors discussed above partially offset by the effect of an increase in the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding following the 2015 merger 

adjusted pro forma eps increased 106 to 219 for the year ended january 3 2016 compared to 198 for the year ended december 28 2014 driven primarily by favorable adjusted pro forma ebitda despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency lower other expense net and lower interest expense partially offset by a higher tax rate

discontinued operations 

see note 4 discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of divested businesses 

critical accounting policies 

note 1 background and basis of presentation  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation   

the consolidated financial statements include the kraft heinz company as well as our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions are eliminated our year end date for financial reporting purposes is the sunday closest to december 31 as a result we occasionally have a 53 rd  week in a fiscal year our year ended january 3 2016 includes a 53 rd  week of activity   the year end date of certain of our us and canada businesses is the saturday closest to december 31   

revenue recognition   

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors   

advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions   

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions   

advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses “sga” we recorded advertising expense of 464 million   in the year ended january 3 2016   241 million  in the year ended december 28 2014   190 million   in the 2013 successor period 22 million   in the 2013 predecessor period and 305 million  in fiscal 2013 for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information   

consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information   

goodwill and intangible assets 

as a result of the 2013 merger and the 2015 merger the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is substantial as of january 3 2016 431 billion of goodwill and 558 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets as more fully described in note 7 goodwill and intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements valuations attributed to the 2015 merger 290 billion goodwill and 451 billion indefinitelived intangible assets are preliminary and potentially subject to change 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2015 prior to completion of the 2015 merger   

the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value   

no impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2015 or 2014 annual goodwill impairment tests however the historical heinz north america consumer products reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of less than 10 as a result of our annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests we recognized noncash impairment losses of 58 million in the year ended january 3 2016 and 221 million in the year ended december 28 2014 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased 

discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate   

postemployment benefit plans 

we provide a range of benefits to our eligible employees and retirees these include defined benefit pension postretirement benefit plans defined contribution and multiemployer pension and medical benefits we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets in future periods within cost of sales and sga 

for our postretirement benefit plans our 2016 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 65 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 49 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2016 and 2024 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost and obligation as of january 3 2016 



our 2016 discount rate assumption is 42 for our postretirement plans our 2016 discount rate assumption is 43 for our us pension plans and 38 for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

beginning in 2016 we will change the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension costbenefit and net postretirement benefit plans cost resulting in a decrease to these cost components we will use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we will account for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

our 2016 expected rate of return on plan assets is 57 for our us pension plans and 58 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2016 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basis point change in our discount rate or a 100basis point change in the actual rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost as of january 3 2016 



income taxes 

we compute our annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating 

uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the balance sheet 

we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position   

we have a significant amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested we do not recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or which may be remitted tax free in certain situations we do recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries which are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 

we intend to continue to reinvest the majority of our foreign subsidiary earnings to support our priorities for growth in international markets and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations if we decided at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us we would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on the applicable us tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings we believe it is not practicable because there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact this uncertainty results from the significant judgment required to analyze the amount of foreign tax credits attributable to the earnings the ability to use foreign tax credits to offset the us tax on the earnings the potential timing of any distributions as well as the local withholding tax and other indirect tax consequences that may arise due to the potential distribution of these earnings

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products tomatoes coffee beans nuts potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins metals and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities 

markets for our key commodities were volatile for the year ended january 3 2016 we expect commodity cost volatility to continue in 2016 we manage commodity cost volatility primarily through pricing and risk management strategies as a result of these risk management strategies our commodity cost experience may not immediately correlate with market price trends 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities and our revolving credit facility as defined below will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs expected integration and restructuring expenditures planned capital expenditures and contributions to our postemployment benefit plans future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we intend to use our cash on hand and our revolving credit facility for daily funding requirements overall we do not expect any negative effects on our funding sources that would have a material effect on our shortterm or longterm liquidity 

cash flow activity 



cash flow activity for the year ended january 3 2016 compared to year ended december 28 2014 

net cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 25 billion  in the year ended january 3 2016 compared to 21 billion  in the year ended december 28 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income as a result of the 2015 merger partially offset by an increase in pension contributions and working capital improvements that were less pronounced than prior year 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was  97 billion  in the year ended january 3 2016 and 349 million  in the year ended december 28 2014 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by our payments to acquire kraft and also included proceeds from our net investment hedges of 488 million  capital expenditures were 648 million for the year ended january 3 2016 we expect 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately 16 billion including capital expenditures required for our ongoing integration and restructuring activities 

net cash provided byused in financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 102 billion  in the year ended january 3 2016 compared to net cash used of 18 billion  in the year ended december 28 2014 the 102 billion  of cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by 100 billion  proceeds from issuance of common stock to the sponsors our cash provided by financing activities also included 148 billion  proceeds from issuances of longterm debt partially offset by longterm debt repayments of 123 billion  and the payment of our quarterly common stock cash dividend starting in the third quarter of 2015 additionally related to our series a preferred stock we made cash distributions of 900 million  in the year ended january 3 2016 which reflected five dividend payments compared to cash distributions of 720 million  in the year ended december 28 2014 which reflected four dividend payments see equity and dividends for further information on our cash distributions related to our series a preferred stock 

cash flow activity for year ended december 28 2014 compared to the 2013 successor period and the unaudited predecessor period from december 24 2012 through june 7 2013 

cash provided by operating activities was 21 billion for the successor period ended december 28 2014 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 35 million for the 2013 successor period and cash provided by operating activities of 668 million for the predecessor period december 24 2012 to june 7 2013 an increase of 14 billion the increase primarily reflects the improvements in our profitability following the various restructuring and productivity initiatives undertaken subsequent to the 2013 merger coupled with higher 2013 mergerrelated costs and charges on the early extinguishment of debt in the prior periods in addition we extended our payment terms with suppliers generating approximately 540 million of incremental cash in the successor period ended december 28 2014 the increase also reflects favorable movements in inventory receivables as well as lower pension contributions and cash taxes partially offset by cash used for restructuring initiatives 

cash used for investing activities totaled 349 million for the year ended december 28 2014 compared with 217 billion for the 2013 successor period and 258 million for the predecessor period december 24 2012 to june 7 2013 the cash used in 2014 for investing activities primarily represented capital expenditures net of proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment the 2013 successor period reflected the 2013 merger consideration net of cash on hand of 215 billion 

cash used for financing activities was 18 billion for the year ended december 28 2014 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 241 billion for the 2013 successor period and cash used for financing activities of 482 million for the predecessor period december 24 2012 to june 7 2013 our cash used in 2014 was driven by repayment of 133 million of our b1 loans repayment of 867 million of our b2 loans and 720 million of series a preferred stock dividends to berkshire hathaway in the 2013 successor period cash provided by financing activities reflected the funding of the 2013 merger including equity contributions from the sponsors totaling 165 billion proceeds of approximately 95 billion in senior secured term loans and proceeds of 31 billion upon the issuance of 4250 second lien senior secured notes these proceeds were partially offset by 321 million of debt issuance costs we used the funding from the 2013 merger to repay 42 billion of h j heinz company outstanding short and long term debt and associated hedge contracts 

cash held by international subsidiaries 

at january 3 2016 approximately 16 billion of cash and shortterm investments were held by international subsidiaries 

we have provided a deferred tax liability of 22 million for undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested except as noted below we consider the unremitted earnings of our nonus subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the us to be indefinitely reinvested for those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested our intent is to reinvest these funds in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated 

earnings to fund our united states cash requirements further certain previously taxed earnings have not yet been remitted and certain intercompany loans have not been repaid as a result in future periods we believe that we could remit approximately 42 billion of cash to the united states without incurring any additional material tax expense if we decide at a later date to repatriate these funds to the united states we would be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on the applicable united states tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid notwithstanding the above for the year ended january 3 2016 we incurred tax expense of approximately 222 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings we repatriated these foreign earnings as part of the integration of kraft and heinz international structures postmerger to make better use of our excess foreign cash and to align our capital structure with our strategic and operational needs the remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries continue to be indefinitely reinvested and would not be available for use in the united states without incurring united states federal and state income tax consequences 

we also made taxable distributions of earnings in in the year ended december 28 2014 and in the 2013 predecessor period we did not have significant taxable distributions of foreign earnings in the 2013 successor period or for fiscal 2013 for the distributions of earnings in the year ended december 28 2014 we incurred tax expense of approximately 64 million the 2014 distributions used the majority of our united states foreign tax credit carry forwards in the 2013 predecessor period our taxable distributions of earnings resulted in a charge to our provision for income taxes of approximately 100 million we were able to use existing foreign tax credit carryforwards to offset the tax liability created by this distribution and therefore there were not incremental cash taxes incurred 

total debt 

our longterm debt increased to 252 billion  at january 3 2016 as compared to 134 billion  at december 28 2014 see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements for information on our debt including the impacts of the 2015 merger and other transactions that occurred during year ended january 3 2016 our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default we were in compliance with all covenants as of january 3 2016 

we maintain our senior credit facilities comprised of our 40 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and a 600 million term loan facility together with the revolving credit facility the “senior credit facilities” our senior credit facilities contain customary representations covenants and events of default at january 3 2016 600 million aggregate principal amount of our term loan facility was outstanding no amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility at january 3 2016 or during the year ended january 3 2016 for further description of our senior credit facilities see note 12 debt  to the consolidated financial statements   

series a preferred stock 

we currently intend to refinance the series a preferred stock in 2016 through issuance of debt other capital market initiatives as well as any excess liquidity we may have available on our balance sheet 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have guarantees or other offbalance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenue or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

see note 15 financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january 3 2016  in millions 



 pension contributions were 286 million for the year ended january 3 2016 we estimate that 2016 pension contributions will be approximately 315 million to our us plans and approximately 30 million to our nonus plans our us contributions include approximately 160 million in the first quarter of 2016 related to the termination of our us nonqualified pension plan that was effective december 31 2015 beyond 2016 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our contributions depend on many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates and other factors as such expected pension contributions for 2016 have been excluded from the above table 

at january 3 2016 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 397 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits from the above table 

equity and dividends 

series a preferred stock 

our series a preferred stock entitles holders to a 900 annual dividend to be paid quarterly in arrears on each march 7 june 7 september 7 and december 7 in cash while the series a preferred stock remains outstanding if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock we must also declare and pay in full the dividend on the series a preferred stock for the thencurrent quarterly period  we made cash distributions of   900 million   during the year ended january 3 2016 which reflects five payments due to the fact that in connection with the declaration of our dividend on our common stock on december 8 2015 we also declared and paid the dividend on the series a preferred stock for the quarterly period that ends march 7 2016  we expect to continue to make cash distributions to pay this dividend as long as the series a preferred stock remains outstanding we made cash distributions of 720 million  in the year ended december 28 2014 and 360 million  in the 2013 successor period the series a preferred stock was issued in connection with the 2013 merger and therefore there were no preferred dividends paid in any of the predecessor periods 

see note 13 preferred stock and warrants  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the series a preferred stock 

common stock dividends 

we paid common stock dividends of 13 billion  in the year ended january 3 2016 no common stock dividends were paid in the year ended december 28 2014 the 2013 successor period or the 2013 predecessor period we paid common stock dividends of 666 million  in fiscal 2013 

on december 8 2015 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0575 per share of common stock which was paid on january 15 2016 to shareholders of record on december 23 2015 in connection with this dividend we recorded 762 million  of dividends payable as of january 3 2016 additionally on february 25 2016 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0575 per share of common stock which is payable on april 8 2016 to shareholders of record on march 18 2016 the present annualized dividend rate is 230 per share of common stock the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net income financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 

the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the 2015 merger which was consummated on july 2 2015 and the related equity investments based on the historical results of operations of heinz and kraft see note 1 background and basis of presentation and note 2 merger and acquisition to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2015 merger 

the following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the years ended january 3 2016 and december 28 2014 are based on the historical financial statements of heinz and kraft after giving effect to the 2015 merger related equity investments and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income 

the kraft heinz statement of income information for the year ended january 3 2016 was derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the historical kraft statement of income includes information for the six months ended june 27 2015 derived from krafts unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our form 8k dated august 10 2015 and information for june 27 2015 to july 2 2015 derived from krafts books and records 

the heinz statement of income information for the year ended december 28 2014 was derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the kraft statement of income information for the year ended december 28 2014 was derived from its consolidated financial statements included in kraft’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 27 2014 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 merger had been consummated on december 30 2013 the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year and combine the historical results of heinz and kraft this is consistent with internal management reporting the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments 

 38 

 the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other things that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition we utilized estimated fair values at the 2015 merger date for the preliminary allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed our purchase price allocation is substantially complete with the exception of identifiable intangible assets certain income tax accounts and goodwill during the measurement period we will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired which may differ materially from our preliminary estimates 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with sec regulation sx article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results in addition the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income do not reflect any additional anticipated synergies operating efficiencies cost savings or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 merger 

the historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are 1 directly attributable to the transaction 2 factually supportable and 3 are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company as a result under sec regulation sx article 11 certain expenses such as deal costs “deal costs” and the fair value stepup of kraft’s inventory “inventory stepup costs” are eliminated from pro forma results in both periods presented in contrast under the asc 805 presentation in note 2 merger and acquisition to the consolidated financial statements these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results 

the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information including the related notes should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of kraft and with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k the historical sec filings of kraft are available to the public at the sec website at wwwsecgov

 summary of pro forma adjustments 

in millions 

unaudited 

adjustments included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are as follows 

 we calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 385 weighted average statutory tax rate for both periods presented 

for the year ended december 28 2014 we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding heinz’s historical weighted average number of basic shares outstanding the 500 million shares issued to the sponsors in connection with their equity investments after giving effect to the preclosing heinz conversion ratio of 0443332 and the historical weighted average number of basic shares of kraft which were converted on a 11 basis into shares of kraft heinz we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding including dilutive securities related to historical heinz the historical heinz diluted eps calculation did not include these securities as historical heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were antidilutive 

for the year ended january 3 2016 we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the kraft heinz weighted average number of basic shares outstanding which included the sponsors shares and the converted kraft shares weighted for the period from the 2015 merger through the year ended january 3 2016 and the sponsors shares as converted and the converted kraft shares both weighted from the beginning of the year through the 2015 merger date we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding by adding the effect of dilutive securities to the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding including dilutive securities related to kraft heinz the kraft heinz diluted eps calculation did not include these securities as kraft heinz was in a net loss position and such securities were antidilutive 

nongaap financial measures 

we use different nongaap financial measures for the comparison of the year ended january 3 2016 to the year ended december 28 2014 and for the comparison of the year ended december 28 2014 to 2013 successor period and the unaudited predecessor period from december 24 2013 through june 7 2013 as our pro forma adjustments are only included when we compare the year ended january 3 2016 to the year ended december 28 2014 our unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income are presented as if the 2015 merger had been consummated on december 30 2013 the first business day of our 2014 fiscal year 

consistent with internal management reporting there are no pro forma adjustments in any of the 2013 periods presented as it would be impracticable to develop adjustments that would be meaningful the information would not be meaningful due to the difficulty of interpreting these pro forma impacts on the various durations of the multiple 2013 periods presented as well as the length of time that has passed since 2013 makes it difficult to assess how the company would have performed if kraft and heinz had been a combined company at that time 

our pro forma financial information and our nongaap financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america“us gaap” 

the nongaap financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures in the same way pro forma organic net sales adjusted pro forma ebitda adjusted pro forma eps organic net sales and adjusted ebitda are not substitutes for their comparable us gaap financial measures such as net sales operating income earnings per common share “eps” or other measures prescribed by us gaap and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures 

management uses these nongaap financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measure and the reconciliation to that measure provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures 

year ended january 3 2016 compared to the year ended december 28 2014 

to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap we have presented in this report selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for 2015 and 2014 we also present pro forma organic net sales adjusted pro forma ebitda and adjusted pro forma eps which are considered nongaap financial measures 

we define pro forma organic net sales as pro forma net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions currency divestitures and 53 rd  week of shipments when it occurs we calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous years exchange rate with the exception of venezuela following our june 28 2015 currency devaluation for which we calculate the previous years results using the current years exchange rate management believes that presenting pro forma organic 

net sales is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results 

adjusted pro forma ebitda is defined as pro forma net incomeloss from continuing operations before interest expense other expenseincome net provision forbenefit from income taxes depreciation and amortization including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits excluding the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized gainslosses on commodity hedges equity award compensation expense impairment losses gainslosses on the sale of a business and nonmonetary currency devaluation adjusted pro forma ebitda is a tool intended to assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations 

we define adjusted pro forma eps as pro forma diluted eps excluding the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized gainslosses on commodity hedges impairment losses gainslosses on the sale of a business nonmonetary currency devaluation and timing impacts of preferred stock dividends management uses adjusted pro forma eps to assess operating performance on a consistent basis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices foreign exchange rates interest rates and production costs we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results we maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates see note 1 background and basis of presentation  and note 16 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures 

by policy we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

effect of hypothetical 10 fluctuation in market prices   

the potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and interest rate contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in currency and swap rates would be in millions 



however it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items in relation to foreign currency contracts this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations debt repayment and debt issuances market effects on debt and foreign currency and our acquisition and divestiture activities
