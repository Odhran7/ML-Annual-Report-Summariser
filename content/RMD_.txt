corporate history 

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries in june 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market in september 1999 we transferred our principal listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol “rmd” in november 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdis on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol “rmd” ten cdis on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors suppliers developers of medical equipment and related technologies and software solution providers for example in the united states our sleep and respiratory care products are sold by resmed corp and our software is sold principally by our brightree and matrixcare subsidiaries 

segment information 

we operate in two segments which are the sleep and respiratory care segment and the software as a service or saas segment see note 14 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

the market 

we are focused on the sleep and related respiratory care markets both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated markets and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes create efficiencies for our customers help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs additionally our software solutions are focused on the outofhospital care market which we believe is fragmented and underserved and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve outofhospital healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care improving clinical decision support and driving interoperability across outofhospital care settings 

sleep and respiratory care 

sleep 

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and 



paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and type 2 diabetes 

a longterm epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea another study published in lancet respiratory medicine in 2019 estimated that mild to severe osa impacts more than 936 million people worldwide including 54 million americans of those impacted it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

while sleep apnea has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population until recently it has typically been diagnosed among middleaged men who are obese however we believe the importance of sleep apnea in women is increasingly being recognized with nearly 40 of new pap patients being female a strong association has been discovered between sleep apnea and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases studies have shown that sleep apnea is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 77 of patients with obesity approximately 76 of patients with chronic heart failure and approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes 

a study presented at the european respiratory society ers international congress in 2021 and later published in chest in 2022 found that using pap therapy as directed can significantly increase sleep apnea patients’ chances of living longer the study concluded that people with obstructive sleep apnea who continued pap therapy were 39 more likely to survive over a threeyear period than osa patients who didn’t researchers found that the survival rate gap remained significant when accounting for patients’ ages overall health other preexisting conditions and causes of death 

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea sleepdisordered breathing or sdb encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink air nightowl or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer 



programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development 

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasingly used as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states or us in the mid1980s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air devices including our aircurve 10 series and lumis devices which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that modulate the average pressure delivered during the night 

respiratory care 

our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients with copd asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases such as overlap syndrome obesity hypoventilation syndrome or ohs and neuromuscular disease including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als we aim to improve their quality of life slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management 

our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from cpap systems at night to those who are dependent on noninvasive or invasive ventilation for lifesupport our devices are predominantly used in the home and to a lesser extent in general hospital wards and respiratory wards we supply cpap and bilevel device systems noninvasive and invasive ventilators humidifiers and accessories including masks and tubing we also provide data management systems designed to improve the management of patients 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic we have observed increased demand for our ventilator devices and masks and during the first six months of the pandemic worked closely with governments health authorities hospitals and physicians in over 100 countries to assess their needs and deliver the ventilation therapy that is essential to treat the respiratory complications of covid19 although there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic we believe the global demand for ventilators and other respiratory support devices used to treat covid19 patients has largely been met our primary focus with regards to the pandemic remains preservation of life our strategy is to maximize the availability of resmed ventilators and other respiratory support devices for the patients that need them most 



chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs it is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways symptoms encountered with copd include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production copd includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis a recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are over 380 million people worldwide who suffer from copd the world’s third leading cause of death 

patients with copd can have different clinical presentations patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen hypoxemia and elevated levels of carbon dioxide hypercapnia a chronic productive cough cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity during sleep chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia in general the more hypoxic a copd patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in copd patients and is more pronounced in rem sleep some copd patients may also suffer from comorbid osa a condition known as overlap syndrome 

home noninvasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe copd by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions 

overlap syndrome in patients with copdosa overlap syndrome cpap has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange noninvasive ventilation or niv has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of copd through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing it may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilatorassociated pneumonia in patients with stable copd the advantages of home niv are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and healthrelated qualityoflife measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays 

obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs is characterized by the combination of obesity chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sleep apnea after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation an estimated 90 of patients with ohs also have osa in patients with ohs positive airway therapy both cpap and niv has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive 

neuromuscular disease neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology or indirectly via nerve pathology impair the functioning of muscles symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue dysphagia dyspnoea on exertion and at rest sleepiness morning headache difficulties with concentration and mood changes most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation being wheelchairbound swallowing difficulties respiratory muscle weakness and eventually death from respiratory failure neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly rapidly progressive conditions such as als and duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years variable or slowly progressive conditions such as myotonic muscular dystrophy are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy 

niv treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases in als patients niv treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures sleeprelated symptoms and survival studies have demonstrated that patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with niv treatment

product development and clinical trials 

we have a strong track record of innovation in the sleep and respiratory care markets in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development and clinical trial efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings and usability but also expanding into new product applications 



we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sleep apnea is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability studies have established a clinical association between untreated sleep apnea and systemic hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease stroke atrial fibrillation chronic heart failure and mortality 

across the sleep and respiratory care platforms we support clinical trials in many countries including the united states germany netherlands france japan the united kingdom switzerland china spain canada singapore and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology we also continue to support some of the largest sleep apnea studies in history by performing advanced statistical analyses on millions of realworld clinical data points collected through our cloudconnected devices and patient engagement tools these studies which we have begun to publish provide clinical insights around patient management device settings and predictors of patient adherence that inform our product development efforts 

we consult with physicians at major medical centers throughout the world to identify clinical and technological trends in the treatment of sleep apnea copd and the other conditions associated with these diseases new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force and network of distributors customers clinicians and patients 

sales and marketing 

we currently market our products in more than 140 countries through a network of distributors and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sleep apnea as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 14 – segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas

manufacturing 

we operate a globally distributed manufacturing network designed to optimize quality cost control time to market for new product introduction and supply chain resilience our manufacturing operations consist of specialist component production as well as assembly and testing of our devices masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products many are available from multiple vendors we also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us any reduction or halt in supply from one of these suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received we strive for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes to deliver yearonyear improvement in output cost and product quality each manufacturing site and team are responsible for the quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact the global supply chain primarily through constraints on raw materials and electronic components including semiconductor chips these constraints have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to manufacture products in quantities necessary to satisfy customer demand which could negatively impact our results of operations additionally we have observed a reduction in both inbound and outbound transportation capacity as a result of port closures and delays associated with the pandemic which is causing longer lead times in receiving raw materials into and distributing finished goods out of our manufacturing facilities as well as increased freight costs we are actively working to mitigate the impact of the widespread supply chain and logistics issues 

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulation for medical devices european medical device regulation “mdr” the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell our main manufacturing sites are certified to iso 13485 and are audited at regular intervals by a notified body additionally our sydney tuas san diego atlanta and moreno valley sites are certified under the medical device single audit program or mdsap an audit of medical device manufacturers’ quality management system to satisfy multiple regulatory requirements mdsap audits are conducted by a mdsap recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of multiple regulatory jurisdictions eg australia brazil canada japan and the united states of america 

our main manufacturing facilities are located in tuas singapore sydney australia chatsworth california johor bahru malaysia atlanta georgia and suzhou china refer to item 2 for additional details on these properties 

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany and korea we receive payments directly from these payors while we do not generally receive direct payments for our products from payors in other countries our success depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from those payors 

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics who invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia china and some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

healthcare reform in the united states continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape in 2011 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms implemented the durable medical equipment prosthetics 



orthotics and supplies dmepos competitive bidding program which included dme that we manufacture and develop specifically cpap and respiratory assist devices or bilevel devices and related supplies and accessories cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years in addition the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act or collectively the aca required cms to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in noncompetitive bidding areas also known as the nonbid or round 3 areas to match competitive bidding prices by 2016 cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and the rates became fully effective july 1 2016 the implementation of the competitive acquisition program has resulted in reduced medicare payment for cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and noncompetitive bidding areas through an interim final rule issued in may 2018 cms increased the fee schedule amounts for certain dme in nonbid areas that qualify as rural and noncontiguous setting payment for these areas for june 1 2018 to december 31 2018 at a 5050 blended reimbursement rate based on the precompetitive bidding reimbursement rate and the adjusted reimbursement rate set through competitive bidding 

due to the lapse of competitive bid contracts as of december 31 2018 effective january 1 2019 medicare beneficiaries could receive dme from any medicareenrolled supplier during a temporary gap in the competitive bidding program between january 1 2019 and december 31 2020 pricing in competitive bidding areas and nonrural contiguous nonbid areas continued to use adjusted fee schedule amounts subject to annual consumer price index cpi adjustments during this temporary gap period beginning in 2019 through december 31 2020 on december 28 2021 cms released a final rule that among other things extended the blended fee schedule amounts for nonbid rural and noncontiguous areas through the end of the covid19 public health emergency which has been renewed through october 13 2022 and a blended fee schedule amount was implemented for all other areas for the same period 

cms competed 16 product categories in round 2021 of the dmepos competitive bidding program which took effect on january 1 2021 and extends through december 31 2021 there have been some revisions to the bidding methodology including the plan to implement surety bond requirements lead item pricing and setting reimbursement rates at the maximum winning bid rate instead of the median winning bid rate although cms previously expanded the categories of devices subject to competitive bidding to include noninvasive ventilators or nivs starting in 2021 in response to the covid19 pandemic cms removed nivs from round 2021 of the dmepos competitive bidding program of the 15 remaining product categories that were bid for in round 2021 cms awarded competitive bidding contracts for only two categories offtheshelf ots back braces and ots knee braces all other product categories were removed from round 2021 payment for the items where contracts were not awarded will be based on adjusted fee schedule amounts pending further rulemaking 

the protecting medicare and american farmers from sequester cuts act was signed into law dec 10 2021 the law extended the 2 medicare sequester moratorium through march 31 2022 and adjusted the sequester to 1 between april 1 2022 and june 30 2022 and reinstates the full 2 sequestration cut beginning july 1 2022 the payment reduction applicable to healthcare providers applies to the approved medicare payment amount after the deductible and coinsurance are applied the reduction in payment does not affect the 20 coinsurance owed by the patient further the law eliminated the potential for an additional 4 medicare sequester in 2022 due to statutory payasyougo paygo requirement for one year the cuts will take effect in 2023 after adjournment of the first session of the 117th congress 

the aca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources also included among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 however this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the us congress for medical device sales beginning in 2016 and permanently repealed effective january 1 2020 the aca also provided for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for dme and home health services 

since its enactment there have been judicial executive and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca on june 17 2021 the us supreme court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the aca brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the aca prior to the supreme court’s decision president biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the aca marketplace which began on february 15 2021 and remained open through august 15 2021 the executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare including among others reexamining medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that 



include work requirements and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through medicaid or the aca 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted on august 2 2011 the budget control act of 2011 was signed into law which among other things resulted in reductions to medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from may 1 2020 through december 31 2021 unless additional congressional action is taken in addition on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

we expect that the aca these new laws and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in medicare and other healthcare funding more rigorous coverage criteria new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our products and services any reduction in reimbursement from medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may have a material adverse impact on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations 

service and warranty 

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our devices in some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

competition 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features valueadded solutions reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them 

our primary sleep and respiratory care competitors include philips bv fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited devilbiss healthcare apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional and new entrant manufacturers seeking to enter our markets finally our products compete with surgical procedures nerve stimulation devices and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sleep apnearelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures devices or therapies such as pharmaceutical by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

for our saas business the market is highly competitive rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services the development of new or innovative solutions by others could result in our solutions becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

any product developed by us will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products and solutions accordingly the speed with which we can develop products and solutions complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and provide commercial supply of products and solutions to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 



patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

we rely on a combination of patents designs trademarks trade secrets copyrights and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products we believe the combination of these rights in aggregate are of material importance to each of our businesses through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this report we own or have licensed rights to approximately 9100 pending allowed or granted patents and designs patents and designs have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change of our patents 565 us patents and 1435 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

government regulations 

fda 

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed pursuant to 510k premarketing clearances and are either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified 



product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 

eea 

in the european economic area which is comprised of the 27 member states of the european union plus norway iceland and liechtenstein or eea medical devices need to comply with specific requirements these requirements were previously known as essential requirements under the former eu medical devices directive council directive 9342eec or mdd and are now defined general safety and performance requirements gspr under the new eu medical devices regulation regulation eu 2017745 or mdr while the requirements set forth in the mdr are generally consistent with those laid out in the mdd with a few exceptions the gspr are described more in detail compared to the essential requirements compliance with the essential requirements under the mdd or the gspr under the mdr is a prerequisite to be able to affix the ce marking to medical devices without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the eea to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirementsgspr and affix the ce marking manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i with no measuring function and which are not sterile where the manufacturer can issue an ec declaration of conformity based on a selfassessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirementsgspr a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body which is a thirdparty organization designated by a competent authority of an eea country to conduct conformity assessments depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure the notified body would audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of the devices the notified body issues a ce certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirementsgspr this certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the ce marking to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related ec declaration of conformity 

as a general rule demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirementsgspr must be based among other things on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use specifically a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse 



events are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence 

all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the eea must comply with the eu medical device vigilance system under the mdr incidents must be reported centrally in the european eudamed database although transitional provisions are in place until eudamed is fully functional and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions or fscas to prevent or reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market an incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics andor performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use the mdr considers serious incidents those incidents which directly or indirectly led might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons a serious deterioration in their state of health or a serious public health threat an fsca may include the recall modification exchange destruction or retrofitting of the device fscas must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers andor to the end users of the device through field safety notices where appropriate our products commercialized in europe are ce marked and classified as either class i or class ii 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the mdr which repeals and replaces the mdd unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the mdr among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation regulation eu 2017746 ivdr applicable as of may 26 2022 provides for the regulatory framework applicable to in vitro diagnostic medical devices 

the mdr was meant to become applicable three years after publication in may 2020 however on april 23 2020 to allow eea national authorities notified bodies manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the covid19 pandemic the european council and parliament adopted regulation 2020561 postponing the date of application of the mdr by one year the mdr thus became applicable on may 26 2021 the mdr transitional provisions allow the placing on the market of devices with a ce certificate issued in accordance with the mdd until may 26 2024 under certain conditions moreover the mdr provides that the following medical devices with a ce certificate issued in accordance with the mdd may continue to be made available on the market or put into service until may 26 2025 

• devices placed on the market in compliance with the mdd prior to may 26 2021 and 

• devices placed on the market after may 26 2021 benefiting from the described mdr transitional provisions 

the mdr among other things 

• strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available 

• establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

• improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through a unique identification number 

• sets up a central database to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu and 

• strengthens rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices such as implants which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market 

we have received certification or initiated the mdr certification process at several locations including sydney australia san diego california and lyon france we continue to transition our certification profile to meet the new mdr requirements 



other regulatory bodies 

our devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the therapeutic goods administration in australia health canada in canada and cfda in china 

other healthcare laws 

we are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims and transparency laws with respect to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors as well as revenue cycle management companies like us 

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act private suits filed under the civil false claims act known as qui tam actions can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government these individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 

the federal civil monetary penalties law prohibits among other things the offering or transfer of remuneration to a medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by medicare or a state healthcare program unless an exception applies 

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities 

the federal physician payments sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs biologicals and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the fda and for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program to report annually to cms information related to i payments and other transfers of value to teaching hospitals physicians as defined by statute and beginning in 2022 physician assistants nurse practitioners and other practitioners and ii ownership and investment interests held by such providers and their immediate family members applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to cms 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation 

also many us states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs in addition in the us certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose 



restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

fcpa and other antibribery and anticorruption laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa prohibits us corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries either directly or through our contracted distributors our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other us and foreign laws rules andor regulations the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations 

data privacy and security laws 

under hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech which we collectively refer to as hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations including the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules to protect the privacy and security of protected health information or phi used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates as well as covered subcontractors hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties for each violation in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of personal information that are applicable to our business for example the california consumer privacy act or the ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that term is broadly defined and provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation although the law includes limited exceptions including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context ccpa’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability further the california privacy rights act or cpra effective january 1 2023 and replacing the ccpa will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses including additional consumer rights processes limitations on data uses new audit requirements for higher risk data and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data it will also create a new california data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement in addition to california several us states including colorado virginia and utah have adopted their own comprehensive data protection laws with varying implementation dates starting january 1 2023 the application of the laws and the requirements contained therein is not uniform we may be required to undertake additional compliance investment and potentially change our business processes to evaluate the application of these laws to our business and to implement compliance measures if we are subject to or affected by hipaa the ccpa the cpra or other domestic privacy and data protection laws any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states 

in addition to these comprehensive data protection laws to date at least three states have adopted laws specifically regulating the collection use storage and disclosure of biometrics and additional states may seek to regulate—andor restrict the use of—biometrics in the future certain of our products use or permit the use of information that could be classified as a biometric under these or other laws if we are subject to or affected by these or other laws we may be 



required to modify the way in which we make available our product or certain features of our product we also may be required to implement additional practices or processes or otherwise invest our resources to comply with these and other regulations 

in some of our operations such as those involving our cloudbased software digital health applications we are a business associate under hipaa and therefore required to comply with the hipaa security rule breach notification rule and certain provisions of the hipaa privacy rule as well as the terms of our business associate agreements that we enter into with our covered entity customers and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 

in addition the general data protection regulation or gdpr went into effect in may 2018 the gdpr imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data in the european economic area or eea the gdpr has increased our obligations for example by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals strengthening individual data rights instituting procedures for mandatory and data breach notifications to regulators within a short timeframe limiting retention periods and secondary use of information including for research purposes increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized ie keycoded data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eea including to the united states recent legal developments in europe have created complexity regarding such transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states for example the european commission and the united kingdom have adopted new standard contractual clauses under which entities may transfer personal data from the european union and the united kingdom which we may be required to implement we must evaluate such data transfers on a casebycase basis to ensure continued permissibility under current law and consistent with new standard contractual clauses european data protection law provides that eea member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition eea member states may modify or impose additional conditions to be able to transmit electronic marketing communications failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the eea member states may result in fines of up to €200 million or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation 

further the united kingdom has adopted the uk general data protection regulation uk gdpr which also has the potential to impose significant data protection fines up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover 

numerous other state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of patient health information and other personal information in addition congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach such as prompt disclosure to affected customers the federal trade commission or ftc and states’ attorneys general have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair andor deceptive acts or practices under the ftc act in addition to data breach notification laws some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information these laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies the ftc also has focused on the use of artificial intelligence ai and the potential bias in ai as one of its enforcement and policy priorities including the use of ai in the healthcare space our services and products may use ai now or in the future we intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information as well as to monitor developments regarding the use of ai that could be relevant to our products and services 

compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules if we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations damage our reputation and customers’ trust

diversity  inclusion 

our values of belonging inclusion and diversity for success “bids” enable us to unlock the strengths of our people to transform healthcare and improve lives we are in our second year of building out a strategic bids practice that strives to impact people patients and products our objectives include expanding employee resource groups “erg” creating and delivering learning  development opportunities in support of bids values identifying new and different hiring practices  measurements emphasizing accessibility  disability inclusion promoting inclusive leadership behaviors  practices and exploring new community partnerships for sourcing 

employee resource groups we continue to place a high value on inclusionbuilding initiatives that create opportunities around cultural awareness and social learnings this is largely done through engaging employees in our erg programs supported by employees who share a common interest in community building professional development improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results we maintain our erg chapters worldwide and currently have twelve groups black asiaamericanpacific islander lgbtqia hispanic and latin veterans women women in sales women in saas parents differently able and mosaics in ireland and france that collectively focus on local and culturally appropriate inclusionbuilding needs 

learning  development of di values our leaders across the organization work directly with the director of diversity to identify and provide awareness trainings for their teams in 2022 we launched a day of learning in each region for employees to learn more about diversity and inclusion with the theme of unconscious bias additionally we launched a bids certificate program and the director of diversity also delivered multiple trainings globally 

strategic inclusive development a global council of ambassadors meets every two months to review and assess developments observations and impressions related to ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts in 2022 we updated our internal policies and employee handbook to formalize certain inclusivity initiatives additionally we assessed the language within the source code of our products and platforms to ensure that it is inclusive and does not perpetuate racist stereotypes 

leadership engagement csuite executives alongside the coo and ceo receive quarterly updates on diversity data and inclusionbuilding efforts additionally the ceo and senior leaders across the organization have diversity and inclusion objectives embedded in their annual and quarterly goals each erg is supported by an executive sponsor 

sourcing  recruiting we train our recruiting workforce on the value of hiring diverse teams and diversity sourcing strategies and we partner with external organizations that develop and supply diverse talent in addition we are building a diversity dashboard to better understand our metrics around applicants candidates and the current workforce in 2022 we launched campaigns focused on collecting internal data and gathering diverse prospective candidates

risk factors 

risks related to our business and industry 

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our products which encompass sleep and respiratory care products and saas offerings are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products for our sleep and respiratory care business the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat for saas the market for business management software is highly competitive rapidly evolving subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current business management software into their operations and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to change from their current solution or provider to one of our platforms or products 

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales and gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations many home health care dealers and outofhospital health providers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of purchasing power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer 

our business financial condition and results of operations could continue to be harmed by the effects of the covid19 pandemic or similar public health crises we are subject to risks associated with public health threats including the global covid19 pandemic which have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our business the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto impact our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict these developments include but are not limited to future resurgences of the virus and its variants actions taken to contain the virus or address its impact and the timing distribution and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments 

although there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic we believe the global demand for ventilators and other respiratory support devices used to treat covid19 patients has largely been met in most markets diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment including physician practices hme distributors and sleep clinics have largely recovered towards prepandemic levels likewise within our saas business we have observed stabilizing patient flow in outofhospital care settings impacted by covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact the global supply chain primarily through constraints on raw materials and electronic components these constraints on raw materials and electronic components are also impacting companies outside of our direct industry which is resulting in a competitive supply environment causing higher costs requiring us to commit to minimum purchase obligations as well as make upfront payments to our suppliers further we are being allocated certain components from our suppliers particularly semiconductor chips and we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers these disruptions have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

produce and supply products in quantities necessary to satisfy customer demand which could negatively impact our results of operations additionally we have observed a reduction in both inbound and outbound transportation capacity as a result of port closures and delays associated with the pandemic which is causing longer lead times in receiving raw materials into and distributing finished goods out of our manufacturing facilities as well as increased freight costs these highly competitive and constrained supply chain conditions are increasing our cost of sales which has and may continue to adversely impact our profitability given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of constraint on our supply chain 

while we expect covid19 may continue to negatively impact certain aspects of our business given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus and the uncertainty about its impact on society and the global economy we cannot predict the extent to which it will affect our global operations furthermore future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks discussed above 

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales in combined europe asia and other markets accounted for approximately 37 and 39 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 respectively our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• economic conditions such as inflation or recession 

• tariffs and other trade barriers 

• compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations 

• difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems 

• reduction in thirdparty payor reimbursement for our products 

• inability to obtain import licenses 

• the impact of public health epidemicspandemics on the global economy such as covid19 that has spread globally 

• the impact of global geopolitical tensions andor conflicts 

• changes in trade policies and in us and foreign tax policies 

• possible changes in export or import restrictions 

• the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects and 

• limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property 

in december 2021 the united states adopted the uyghur forced labor prevention act “uflpa” which creates a rebuttable presumption that any goods wares articles and merchandise mined produced or manufactured in whole or in part in the xinjiang uyghur administrative region of china or that are produced by certain entities are prohibited from importation into the united states and are not entitled to entry these import restrictions came into effect in june 2022 additionally the military conflict between russia and ukraine has resulted in the implementation of sanctions by the us and other governments against russia and has caused significant volatility and disruptions to the global markets while we are not presently aware of any direct impacts these restrictions have had on our suppliers’ supply chains disruptions resulting from the conflict in ukraine and the uflpa may materially and negatively impact our suppliers’ ability to obtain a sufficient supply of raw materials necessary to meet the quantity andor timing of our product demands further it is not possible to predict the short and longterm implications of this conflict which could include but are not limited to further sanctions uncertainty about economic and political stability increases in inflation rate and energy prices cyberattacks supply chain challenges and adverse effects on currency exchange rates and financial markets we are continuing to monitor the situation in china ukraine and globally as well as assess its potential impact on our business although our sales into russia and ukraine did not constitute a material portion of our total revenue in 2022 further escalation of geopolitical tensions or new geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

do business which could adversely affect our business andor our supply chain business partners or customers in the broader region 

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a part of the regulatory process to obtain marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products or for other reasons we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints we our competitors or other third parties may also conduct clinical trials involving our commercially marketed products the results of clinical trials may be unfavorable or inconsistent with previous findings or could identify safety signals associated with our products current or future clinical trials may not meet primary endpoints may reveal disadvantages of our products and solutions for various markets we address or could generate unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data clinical data or the market’s or regulatory bodies’ perception of the clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product clearances or approvals and our position in and share of the markets in which we participate moreover if these clinical trials identify serious safety issues associated with our marketed products potentially adverse consequences could result including that regulatory authorities could withdraw clearances or approvals of our products we could be required to halt the marketing and sales of our products or recall our products we could be required to update our product labeling with additional warnings we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our reputation may suffer any of these could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business we may also be affected by the product recalls and other risks associated with the products of our competitors if customers and patients are uncertain if issues affecting our competitors may also affect us 

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain us and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products we face the risks that 

• thirdparties will infringe our intellectual property rights 

• our nondisclosure agreements will be breached 

• we will not have adequate remedies for infringement 

• our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors 

• thirdparties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our products or 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

• thirdparties may assert patents and other intellectual property rights against our suppliers causing interruption in supply of components or other essential inputs 

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed on proprietary rights of others if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

if we fail to attract develop and retain key employees our business may suffer our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing technology and research and development positions competition for top talent in the healthcare technology and saas industries can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit develop and retain qualified employees to drive our strategic goals our business could suffer 

our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business as of june 30 2022 our total consolidated debt was 08 billion and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including as a result of our pending acquisition of medifox dan which is expected to close during our fiscal year 2023 our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditure acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

• exposing us to greater interest rate risk 

our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness which could impede our growth our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

risks related to manufacturing it systems commercial operations and plans for future growth 

disruptions in the supply of components from our suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us disruptions to our suppliers including disruptions in connection with covid19 and its variants may limit our ability to manufacture our devices in a timely or costeffective manner which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction delay or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices in a timely or costeffective manner which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

in particular a global semiconductor supply shortage is having wideranging effects across multiple industries and it has impacted suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us high demand and shortages of supply have adversely affected and could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of semiconductors 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

and electronic components on commercially reasonable terms or at all while we have entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance we will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or that suppliers will fulfill their commitments under existing agreements furthermore in order to secure such necessary components we may be obligated to purchase them at prices that are higher than those available in the current market andor may incur significant price increases from these suppliers in the future in addition we may be required to commit to greater purchase volumes andor make prepayments to our suppliers extended lead times and decreased availability of key components may also cause an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations delays in our ability to produce and deliver our devices could cause our customers to purchase alternative products from our competitors 

in response to the global semiconductor supply shortage we have recently expanded our global offering of devices to include cardtocloud c2c versions of our prior model airsense 10 and aircurve 10 offerings that do not incorporate a communications module we introduced c2c models to address the growing backlog of patients waiting for therapy with resmed devices because c2c devices do not include communications capability they involve a more manual workflow for our customers and may face resistance in the market as the backlog of patients waiting for treatment is reduced the c2c offering while appropriate in the short term also may not be consistent with our long term strategy of connecting all devices with airview 

additionally increases in product demand including in response to a product recall by one of our competitors philips have resulted and could continue to result in shipment delays higher costs for materials and components and increased expenditures for freight and other expenses which have and could continue to negatively impact our profit margins if supply constraints continue our ability to meet demand and our corresponding ability to sell affected products may be materially reduced we have and may continue to be required to allocate or prioritize orders for our devices and our failure to timely deliver desirable products to meet demand may harm relationships with our customers 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

actual or attempted breaches of security unauthorized disclosure of information denial of service attacks or the perception that personal andor other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure could result in a material loss of business substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation despite the implementation of security measures our internal computer and information technology systems and those of our vendors and customers are vulnerable to attack and damage from computer viruses malware denial of service attacks unauthorized access or other harm including from threat actors seeking to cause disruption to our business we face risks related to the protection of information that we maintain—or engage a thirdparty to maintain on our behalf—including unauthorized access acquisition use disclosure or modification of such information cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware ransomware denialofservice attacks social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality integrity and availability of information a material cyberattack or security incident could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our business operations damage to our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects 

we receive collect process use and store a large amount of information from our clients our patients and our own employees including personal information protected health and other sensitive and confidential information this data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks including the internet the secure transmission of such information over the internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems we have implemented security measures technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify detect and prevent unauthorized access alteration use or disclosure of our clients’ patients’ and employees’ data however the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities beyond external criminal activity systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations 

if someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems they could steal any information located therein or cause serious and potentially long lasting disruption to our operations security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss andor litigation fines and sanctions we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data while we maintain insurance that covers certain security incidents we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability 

we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security including hipaa and european data privacy laws complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny fines civil liability or damage to our reputation in addition any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information additional costs associated with repairing any system damage incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches including organizational changes deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies employee training and engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants additionally the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 

we cannot assure you that any of our thirdparty service providers with access to our or our clients patients andor employees’ personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof which could have a corresponding effect on our business 

we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions which could adversely affect our operating results part of our growth strategy includes acquiring businesses consistent with our commitment to innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea and respiratory care as well as our saas business for example we acquired matrixcare in november 2018 propeller health in january 2019 and in june 2022 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire medifox dan which is expected to close during our fiscal year 2023 the medifox dan acquisition remains subject to regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions and should the acquisition fail to close we will not realize the benefits that we expect to receive from the acquisition moreover the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the business and operations of the acquired companies additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected acquisitions involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be or will remain profitable 

moreover we have recorded intangible assets including goodwill in connection with our acquisitions at least on an annual basis we must evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the intangible assets’ values the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill is dependent upon various considerations and assumptions including macroeconomic conditions industry and market characteristics projections of acquired companies’ future revenue discount rates and expectations of future cash flows while we have made such assumptions in good faith and believe them to be reasonable the assumptions may turn out to be materially inaccurate including for reasons beyond our control changes in such assumptions may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may be impaired consequently we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of intangible assets is determined 

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

we have expanded our marketing activities in some markets to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

our saas business depends substantially on customers entering into renewing upgrading and expanding their agreements for cloud services term licenses and maintenance and support agreements with us any decline in our customer renewals upgrades or expansions could adversely affect our future operating results we typically enter into termbased agreements for our licensed onpremises offerings cloud services and maintenance and support services which customers have discretion to renew or terminate at the end of the initial term in order for us to improve our operating results it is important that new customers enter into renewable agreements and our existing customers renew upgrade and expand their termbased agreements when the initial contract term expires our customers have no obligation to renew upgrade or expand their agreements with us after the terms have expired our customers’ renewal upgrade and expansion rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our offerings our pricing the effects of general economic conditions competitive offerings or alterations or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our customers do not renew upgrade or expand their agreements with us or renew on terms less favorable to us our revenues may decline 

if our saas products fail to perform properly or if we fail to develop enhancements we could lose customers become subject to service performance or warranty claims and our market share could decline our saas operations are dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruptions and as we continue to grow we will need to devote additional resources to improving our infrastructure in order to maintain the performance of our products and solutions the applications underlying our saas products are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors which may cause disruptions in availability or other performance problems we have from time to time found defects in our products and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in data unavailability unauthorized access to loss corruption or other harm to our customers’ data while we implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance we may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before implementing our products and solutions consequently we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our products and solutions have been deployed if we fail to perform timely maintenance or if customers are otherwise dissatisfied with the frequency andor duration of our maintenance services and related system outages our existing customers could elect not to renew their contracts delay or withhold payment or potential customers may not adopt our products and solutions and our brand and reputation could be harmed in addition the occurrence of any material defects errors disruptions in service or other performance problems with our software could result in warranty or other legal claims against us and diversion of our resources the costs incurred in addressing and correcting any material defects or errors in our software and expanding our infrastructure and architecture in order to accommodate increased demand for our products and solutions may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results further if we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve to the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development our financial results may suffer an inability for technological or other reasons to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business 

if there are interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology or infrastructure our existing saas customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our platforms we depend on services from various third parties as well as our own technical operations infrastructure to distribute our saas products via the internet if a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our

platform or otherwise experiences service outages such failure could interrupt our customers’ access to our service which could adversely affect their perception of our platforms reliability and our revenues any disruptions in these services including as a result of actions outside of our control would significantly impact the continued performance of our saas products in the future these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these services could result in decreased functionality of our saas products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available from another provider is identified obtained and integrated into our infrastructure 

to meet our business needs we must maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to ensure that our saas products are accessible design and mechanical errors spikes in usage volume and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail resulting in interruptions in our saas products any interruptions or delays in our service whether or not caused by our products or as a result of thirdparty error our own error natural disasters or security breaches whether accidental or willful could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease andor our expenses to increase 

any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation cause customers to terminate their agreements with us impair our ability to obtain contract renewals from existing customers impair our ability to grow our customer base result in the expenditure of significant financial technical and engineering resources subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

climate change and related natural disasters or other events beyond our control could negatively impact our business operations and financial condition natural disasters and other business disruptions could adversely affect our business and financial condition and global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects the impacts of climate change may include physical risks such as frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions social and human effects such as population dislocations or harm to health and wellbeing compliance costs and transition risks shifts in market trends and other adverse effects such impacts may disrupt parties in our supply chain our customers and our operations for example if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace in the event our facilities were affected by natural or manmade disasters we could be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

in addition the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more legal and regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment including regulating greenhouse gas emissions alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives if such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations further there may be increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from the market and other stakeholders with respect to environmental social and governance esg practices any such regulatory changes or increased market expectations could also have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and comply with other regulatory requirements or stakeholder expectations

risks related to noncompliance with laws regulations and healthcare industry shifts 

healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the aca was signed into law in the united states the aca made changes that significantly impacted the healthcare industry including medical device manufacturers one of the principal purposes of the aca was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of americans who were uninsured the aca required adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate 

the aca also contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this included new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax was applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx and certain respiratory care products through a series of legislative amendments the tax was suspended beginning in 2016 and permanently repealed effective january 1 2020 in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the aca also included among other things directions to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payors for our products and decreased profits to us 

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted these changes included an aggregate reduction in medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 the cares act which was signed into law in march 2020 and subsequently amended suspended the payment reductions from may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and extended the sequester by one additional year through 2030 in addition on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

the full impact on our business of the aca and other new laws is uncertain nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted if any or how such changes would affect the demand for our products future actions by the administration and the us congress including but not limited to repeal or replacement of the aca could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge on june 17 2021 the us supreme court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the aca brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the aca prior to the supreme court’s decision president biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the aca marketplace which began on february 15 2021 and remained open through august 15 2021 the executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare including among others reexamining medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through medicaid or the aca it is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the biden administration or other efforts if any to challenge repeal or replace the aca will impact the aca or our business 

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states the aca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep apnea conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma under the program our customers who provide dme must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas in addition under the aca in 2016 cms adjusted the prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and were fully effective july 1 2016 this program has significantly reduced the medicare reimbursement to our customers compared with reimbursement in 2011 at the beginning of the program the 21st century cures act retroactively adjusted rates in nonbid areas to allow for the higher phasein rates to be paid for items furnished between july 1 2016 and december 31 2016 rather than the lower fullyadjusted rates rules issued by cms in 2018 resumed the higher phasein rates in rural and noncontiguous noncompetitive bidding areas for items furnished between june 1 2018 and december 31 2020 pursuant to the cares act these higher phasein rates were extended through december 31 2020 or through the end of the covid19 public health emergency and were implemented in areas other than rural areas and noncontiguous areas for the same period on march 7 2019 cms announced it would initiate a new round of competitive bidding named round 2021 with contracts effective on january 1 2021 through december 31 2023 in addition to adopting new bidding processes cms expanded the product categories included in competitive bidding to include noninvasive ventilators however due to the covid19 pandemic cms removed nivs from round 2021 of the dmepos competitive bidding program cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories which had been included in prior rounds of competitive bidding were included in the 15 remaining product categories that were bid for in round 2021 however cms did not award competitive bidding contracts for any product categories other than ots back and knee braces payment for items where contracts were not awarded – including cpap and respiratory assist devices – will be based on adjusted fee schedule amounts at this time we cannot predict the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition if changes are made to this program in the future it could affect amounts being recovered by our customers 

with respect to medicare reimbursement the protecting medicare and american farmers from sequester cuts act was signed into law dec 10 2021 the law extended the 2 medicare sequester moratorium through march 31 2022 adjusted the sequester to 1 between april 1 2022 and june 30 2022 and reinstated the full 2 sequestration cut beginning july 1 2022 the reduction in payment to healthcare providers is to the calculated medicare payment after the approved amount is determined and the deductible and coinsurance are applied and not the 20 coinsurance owed by the patient further the law eliminated the potential for an additional 4 medicare sequester in 2022 due to statutory payasyougo paygo requirement for one year these additional cuts will take effect in 2023 after adjournment of the first session of the 117th congress 

in addition our products are the subject of periodic studies by third party agencies including the agency for healthcare research and quality in the united states intended to review the comparative effectiveness of different treatments of the same illness although the results of comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate any reimbursement policies for public or private payers it is not clear what if any effect such research will have on the sales of our products decreases in thirdparty reimbursement for our products or a decision by a thirdparty payer to not cover our products as a result of a thirdparty study could have a material adverse effect on our sales results of operations and financial condition 

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to 

• the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or paying remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate the antikickback statute itself to have committed a violation the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers distributors and revenue cycle management companies like us violations of the federal antikickback statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation plus up to three times the remuneration involved violations of the federal antikickback statute can also result in significant criminal penalties and imprisonment 

• federal civil and criminal false claims laws including the false claims act and civil monetary penalty laws that prohibit among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill thirdparty payors in addition the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act violations can result in debarment suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid when an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil false claims act the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties for each false claim plus treble damages and exclude the entity from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 

• hipaa which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation 

• the federal physician sunshine act requirements under the aca which impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed by certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies to physicians including doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified nurse anesthetists anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives 

• federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers and 

• state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as state antikickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures 

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these types of investigations healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs additional compliance and reporting obligations imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

in december 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with the us department of justice and the us attorneys’ offices for the district court of south carolina the southern district of california the northern district of iowa and the eastern district of new york the agreement resolved five lawsuits originally brought by whistleblowers under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act and allegations that we a provided dme companies with free telephone call center services and other free patient outreach services that enabled these companies to order resupplies for their patients with sleep apnea b provided sleep labs with free and belowcost positive airway pressure masks and diagnostic machines as well as free installation of these machines c arranged for and fully guaranteed the payments due on interestfree loans that dme supplies acquired from thirdparty financial institutions for the purchase of our equipment and d provided nonsleep specialist physicians free home sleep testing devices referred to as “apnealink” we agreed with the government to civilly resolve these matters for a payment of 395 million 375 million to the federal government and 2 million to the various states and we incurred additional fees and administrative costs that typically accompany such a resolution amounting to 11 million the specific allegations and the resolution of those allegations are contained in the company’s settlement agreement with the adverse parties the total final costs relating to these matters was 406 million 

contemporaneous with the civil settlement we also entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement or cia with the department of health and human services office of inspector general the cia required among other things that we implement additional controls around our product pricing and sales and that we conduct internal and external monitoring of our arrangements with referrals sources the settlement agreement with the government and the cia could result in reputational harm or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could materially adversely affect our financial results and our ability to operate our business in addition our failure to comply with our obligations under the cia could result in monetary penalties and our exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs the costs associated with compliance with the cia or any liability or consequences associated with its breach could have an adverse effect on our operations liquidity and financial condition 

our use and disclosure of personal information including health information is subject to federal state and foreign privacy and security regulations and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm the privacy and security of personal information whether stored maintained received or transmitted electronically or in paper form is a major issue in the us and abroad while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies legal standards for privacy including but not limited to “unfairness” and “deception” as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose audience and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business recently there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacyrelated lawsuits filed against companies concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure security or deletion of personally identifiable information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business 

numerous foreign federal and state laws and regulations govern collection dissemination use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information including i state privacy and confidentiality laws including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches ii hipaa and iii european and other foreign data protection laws including the eu gdpr and the uk gdpr 

hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information or protected health information by health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically or covered entities and their “business associates” which are persons or 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involve creating receiving maintaining or transmitting protected health information as well as their covered subcontractors certain portions of our business such as the cloudbased software digital health applications are subject to hipaa as a business associate of our covered entity clients to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve access to phi hipaa requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa as a business associate we are also directly liable for compliance with hipaa penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties 

hipaa authorizes state attorneys’ general to file suit under hipaa on behalf of state residents courts can award damages costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of hipaa in such cases while hipaa does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for hipaa violations its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of phi 

hipaa further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” covered entities must notify affected individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” if their unsecured phi is subject to an unauthorized access use or disclosure if a breach affects 500 patients or more covered entities must report it to hhs and local media without unreasonable delay and hhs will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website if a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals the covered entity must log it and notify hhs at least annually 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us our solutions may be perceived as not secure we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients we are liable not only contractually but also directly under hipaa 

in addition the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that term is broadly defined and provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa includes civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches although the law includes limited exceptions including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability further the california privacy rights act or cpra which becomes effective on january 1 2023 superseding the ccpa will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses including additional consumer rights processes limitations on data uses new audit requirements for higher risk data and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data it will also create a new california data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement several additional us states have implemented comprehensive data privacy laws which will become effective starting in january 1 2023 if we are subject to or affected by hipaa the ccpa the cpra or other domestic privacy and data protection law any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition 

in addition to these comprehensive data protection laws to date at least three states have adopted laws specifically regulating the collection use storage and disclosure of biometrics and additional states may seek to regulate—andor restrict the use of—biometrics in the future certain of our products use or permit the use of information that could be classified as a biometric under these or other laws if we are subject to or affected by these or other laws we may be required to modify the way in which we make available our product or certain features of our product we also may be required to implement additional practices or processes or otherwise invest our resources to comply with these and other regulations if we are unable to comply with these laws or if these laws require us to change our products or services we may encounter liability that could adversely affect our financial condition 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in nonus countries covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information for example eu member states the united kingdom and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time 

in addition the gdpr went into effect in may 2018 the gdpr imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data in the european economic area or eea the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and increased our obligations for example by imposing higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data requiring more robust disclosures to individuals strengthening individual data rights shortening timelines for data breach notifications limiting retention periods and secondary use of information including for research purposes increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized ie keycoded data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eea including to the united states and recent legal developments in europe have created complexity regarding such transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states for example the european commission and the united kingdom have adopted new standard contractual clauses under which entities may transfer personal data from the european union and the united kingdom which we may be required to implement we must evaluate such data transfers on a casebycase basis to ensure continued permissibility under current law and consistent with the new standard contractual clauses european data protection law provides that eea member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the eea member states may result in fines of up to €200 million or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation eu member states and the uk also have established laws pertaining to electronic monitoring which could require us to take additional compliance measures failure to comply with such laws may subject us to penalties 

the united kingdom also has adopted its version of the general data protection regulation “uk gdpr” the united kingdom gdpr mirrors the fines under the gdpr ie fines up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover 

compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may also result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security incident such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business activities are subject to extensive regulation and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore certain of our products could be subject to recall if the food and drug administration or the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that those products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results certain of our products and services include the use of artificial intelligence ai which is intended to enhance the operation of our products and services the ftc recently has issued a report expressing a concern regarding ai and bias across industry sectors including in the healthcare space and has suggested that such bias could lead to unfair and deceptive practices among other concerns any changes to our ability to use ai or concerns about bias could require us to modify our products and services or could have other negative financial impact on our business 

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline unless a product is exempt before we can 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process for example in november 2018 fda officials announced steps that the fda intended to take to modernize the 510k premarket notification pathway among other things the fda announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510k pathway toward the use of newer predicates these proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510k clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old in september 2019 the fda also issued revised final guidance establishing a “safety and performance based pathway” for “manufacturers of certain wellunderstood device types” allowing manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the fda to demonstrate substantial equivalence obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process the fda has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop productspecific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria and recommended testing methodologies for each such device type where feasible some of these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted although the fda may work with congress to implement such proposals through legislation accordingly it is unclear the extent to which any proposals if adopted could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business 

the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing stricter requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the united states significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are

subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european union we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

disruptions at the fda and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all which could negatively impact our business the ability of the fda to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels statutory regulatory and policy changes the fda’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and other events that may otherwise affect the fda’s ability to perform routine functions average review times at the fda have fluctuated in recent years as a result in addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable disruptions at the fda and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved medical devices to be reviewed andor approved by necessary government agencies which would adversely affect our business for example over the last several years including for 35 days beginning on december 22 2018 the us government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the fda have had to furlough critical fda employees and stop critical activities 

separately in response to the covid19 pandemic on march 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and subsequently on march 18 2020 the fda temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities regulatory authorities outside the united states may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the covid19 pandemic subsequently on july 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to resume certain onsite inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a riskbased prioritization system the fda intends to use this riskbased assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities if a prolonged government shutdown occurs or if global health concerns continue to prevent the fda or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections reviews or other regulatory activities it could significantly impact the ability of the fda or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fdacleared products in particular clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 

laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities our business activities include contacts with consumers in different parts of the world certain laws such as the us telephone consumer protection act regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts with consumers such as phone calls texts or emails our use of outbound contacts may be restricted by existing laws or by laws regulations or regulatory decisions that may be adopted in the future similarly certain data privacy laws including ccpa and 



resmed inc and subsidiaries 

subsequently cpra and the gdpr require disclosure of our privacy practices to consumers if we are found to have violated these laws or regulations we may be subjected to substantial fines penalties or liabilities to consumers 

tax laws regulations and enforcement practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and aggressive positions taken by tax authorities 

changes or clarifications to us tax laws could materially affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment hybrid entities and instruments transfer pricing and tax treaties the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations additionally  the us treasury department recently proposed the adoption of a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 which if enacted could negatively impact our effective tax rate 

developments in relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices and enforcement practices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows including the need to obtain additional financing 

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that require significant judgment and are subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

on september 19 2021 we concluded the settlement agreement with the australian taxation office “ato” in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 “ato settlement” the ato settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles 

the final net impact of the ato settlement was 2387 million which represents a gross amount of 3817 million including interest and penalties of 481 million and adjustments for credits and deductions of 1430 million as a result of the ato settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies we recorded a benefit of 141 million within other comprehensive income and a 41 million reduction of tax credits which was recorded to income tax expense as a result of the ato settlement we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position 

on september 28 2021 we remitted final payment to the ato of 2848 million consisting of the agreed settlement amount of 3817 million less prior remittances made to the ato of 969 million 

tax years 2018 to 2021 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax any final assessment resulting from tax audits may result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock 

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets global economic conditions could make it difficult for us our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities adverse economic conditions including inflation and higher interest rates could cause customers to reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and potentially decrease our profitability in addition prevailing economic conditions could constrain the supply of components used in the manufacturing of our products which may result in higher costs and impact our ability to meet customer demand we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic

slowdown or the speed of any subsequent economic recovery if the economy or markets in which we operate were to deteriorate our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

• the introduction of new products by us or our competitors 

• the geographic mix of product sales 

• the success and costs of our marketing efforts in new regions 

• changes in thirdparty payor reimbursement 

• timing of regulatory clearances and approvals 

• costs associated with acquiring and integrating new businesses technologies and product offerings 

• timing of orders by distributors 

• expenditures incurred for research and development 

• competitive pricing in different regions 

• the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses and 

• other activities including product recalls by our competitors 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

delaware law and provisions in our charter could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock

key trends and economic factors affecting our business 

supply chain disruptions 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact the global supply chain primarily through a lack of availability of raw materials and electronic components the lack of raw materials and electronic components is also impacting companies outside of our direct industry which is resulting in a competitive supply environment causing higher costs requiring us to commit to minimum purchase obligations as well as make upfront payments to our suppliers additionally we have observed a reduction in both inbound and outbound transportation capacity as a result of port closures and delays associated with the pandemic which is causing longer lead times in receiving raw materials into and distributing finished goods out of our manufacturing facilities in addition to increased freight costs these highly competitive and constrained supply chain conditions are increasing our cost of sales which has and may continue to decrease our gross margin given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of constraint on our supply chain 

competitor recall 

an ongoing product recall by one of our competitors philips has resulted in increased demand for our sleep and respiratory care devices the supply chain disruptions outlined above have constrained and restricted our ability to meet this increased demand and we expect these constraints will continue into the fiscal year ending june 30 2023 

covid19 

although there is still substantial uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic we believe the global demand for ventilators and other respiratory support devices used to treat covid19 patients has largely been met we did not observe material incremental demand for our ventilator devices and masks associated with the pandemic during the twelve months ended june 30 2022 

in most markets diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment including physician practices home medical equipment “hme” distributors and sleep clinics have largely recovered towards prepandemic levels as vaccines and boosters roll out globally likewise we have continued to observe stabilizing patient flow in our outofhospital care settings within our saas business 

our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide as we progressively reopen our offices around the world the pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity position 

impact on our business 

as a result of these trends we were not able to meet all the demand available in the market during the twelve months ended june 30 2022 we are being allocated components from our suppliers particularly semiconductor chips and we are thus being forced to allocate our outbound products to our customers we have established an allocation process with clear 



guiding principles that give priority to the production and delivery of devices to meet the needs of the highest acuity patients first 

fiscal year ended june 30 2022 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2021 

net revenues 

net revenue for the year ended june 30 2022 increased to 35781 million from 31968 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 3813 million or 12 a 13 increase on a constant currency basis the following table summarizes our net revenue disaggregated by segment product and region for the year ended june 30 2022 compared to the year ended june 30 2021 in thousands

net revenue from our sleep and respiratory care business in the united states canada and latin america for the year ended june 30 2022 increased to 19818 million from 17051 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 2767 million or 16 the increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks including recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic and increased demand following a recent product recall by one of our competitors partially offset by decreased covid19 related demand for our ventilators 

net revenue from our sleep and respiratory care business in combined europe asia and other markets increased for the year ended june 30 2022 to 11955 million from 11181 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 774 million or 7 an increase of 11 on a constant currency basis the constant currency increase in sales in combined europe asia and other markets predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices and masks including 



recovery of core sleep patient flow that was previously impacted by the pandemic partially offset by decreased covid19related demand for our ventilators 

net revenue from devices for the year ended june 30 2022 increased to 18669 million from 16100 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 2569 million or 16 including an increase of 24 in the united states canada and latin america and an increase of 7 in combined europe asia and other markets a 10 increase on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of foreign currency movements device sales for the year ended june 30 2022 increased by 17

software as a service 

net revenue from our saas business for the year ended june 30 2022 was 4008 million compared to 3736 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 272 million or 7 the increase was predominantly due to continued growth in our hme and home health and hospice verticals in addition to stabilizing patient flow in our facilities vertical 

gross profit and gross margin gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2022 to 20243 million from 18391 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 1852 million or 10 gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 566 for the year ended june 30 2022 compared with the 575 for the year ended june 30 2021 the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher logistics and manufacturing costs partially offset by favorable changes in product mix as we sold an increased proportion of higher acuity devices in addition to higher average selling prices 

operating expenses 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses in thousands 



selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2022 to 7394 million from 6704 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 690 million or 10 selling general and administrative expenses as reported in us dollars were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the us dollar which decreased our expenses by approximately 133 million excluding the impact of foreign currency movements selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2022 increased by 12 compared to the year ended june 30 2021 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2022 improved to 207 compared to 210 for the year ended june 30 2021 

the constant currency increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in employeerelated costs for the year ended june 30 2022 compared to the year ended june 30 2021 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2022 to 2536 million from 2253 million for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 283 million or 13 research and development expenses were favorably 



impacted by the movement of international currencies against the us dollar which decreased our expenses by approximately 30 million as reported in us dollars excluding the impact of foreign currency movements research and development expenses for the year ended june 30 2022 increased by 14 compared to the year ended june 30 2021 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 71 for the year ended june 30 2022 compared to 70 for the year ended june 30 2021 

the constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and saas solutions 

amortization of acquired intangible assets 

amortization of acquired intangible assets was consistent at 311 million for the years ended the year ended june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 

restructuring expenses 

in november 2020 we closed our portable oxygen concentrator business which was part of the sleep and respiratory care segment during the year ended june 30 2021 we recognized restructuring expenses of 139 million primarily related to inventory writedowns of 52 million accelerated amortization of acquired intangible assets of 51 million asset impairments of 23 million employeerelated costs of 07 million and contract cancellation costs of 06 million of the total expense recognized during the year ended june 30 2021 the inventory writedown of 52 million is presented within cost of sales and the remaining 87 million in restructuring costs is separately disclosed as restructuring expenses on the consolidated statements of income we do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with this activity in the future 

total other income loss net 

the following table summarizes our other income loss in thousands 



total other income loss net for the year ended june 30 2022 was a loss of 398 million compared to a loss of 200 million for the year ended june 30 2021 the increase in loss was primarily due to losses associated with our investments in marketable and nonmarketable equity securities which were a loss of 122 million for the year ended june 30 2022 compared to a gain of 145 million for the year ended june 30 2021 this was partially offset by lower losses attributable to equity method investments for the year ended june 30 2022 of 85 million compared to 112 million for the year ended june 30 2021 additionally interest expense net decreased to 223 million for the year ended june 30 2022 compared to 236 million for the year ended june 30 2021 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate decreased to 188 for the year ended june 30 2022 from 463 for the year ended june 30 2021 our effective rate of 188 for the year ended june 30 2022 differs from the statutory rate of 210 primarily due to research credits foreign operations and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee sharebased awards 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended june 30 2022 was primarily related to the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits recorded in connection with the australian tax office ato transfer pricing dispute outlined below excluding the impact of the unrecognized tax benefit our effective income tax rate for the year ended june 30 2021 was 182 the increase in our effective tax rate excluding the impact of the unrecognized tax benefit for the year ended june 30 2021 was due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings for the year ended june 30 2022 



on september 19 2021 we concluded the settlement agreement with the ato in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 “ato settlement” the ato settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles 

the final net impact of the ato settlement was 2387 million which represents a gross amount of 3817 million including interest and penalties of 481 million and adjustments for credits and deductions of 1430 million as a result of the ato settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies we recorded a benefit of 141 million within other comprehensive income and a 41 million reduction of tax credits which was recorded to income tax expense as a result of the ato settlement we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position 

on september 28 2021 we remitted final payment to the ato of 2848 million consisting of the agreed settlement amount of 3817 million less prior remittances made to the ato of 969 million 

our singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30 2030 as a result of the us tax act we treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable during the year ended june 30 2018 therefore future repatriation of cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax if repatriated 

net income and earnings per share 

as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2022 was 7794 million compared to net income of 4745 million for the year ended june 30 2021 our earnings per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2022 was 530 compared to 324 for the year ended june 30 2021 an increase of 64 unrecognized tax benefits as described at note 13 – income taxes reduced our diluted earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2021 by 170 per share 

summary of nongaap financial measures 

in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with gaap our management uses certain nongaap financial measures such as nongaap revenue nongaap cost of sales nongaap gross profit nongaap gross margin nongaap income from operations nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share in evaluating the performance of our business we believe that these nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods for these reasons we use nongaap information internally in planning forecasting and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

the measure “nongaap cost of sales” is equal to gaap cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and restructuring expense associated with inventory writedowns following the closure of the portable oxygen concentrator business the measure “nongaap gross profit” is the difference between gaap net revenue and nongaap cost of sales and “nongaap gross margin” is the ratio of nongaap gross profit to gaap net revenue 



these nongaap measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below in thousands except percentages 



the measure “nongaap income from operations” is equal to gaap income from operations once adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring expense associated with the closure of the portable oxygen concentrator business nongaap income from operations is reconciled with gaap income from operations below in thousands 



the measure “nongaap net income” is equal to gaap net income once adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles net of tax acquisitionrelated expenses reserve for disputed tax positions restructuring expenses net of tax and gain loss on equity investments the measure “nongaap diluted earnings per share” is the ratio of nongaap net income to diluted shares outstanding these nongaap measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures below in thousands except for per share amounts 





liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and access to our revolving credit facility our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities selling and marketing activities capital expenditures strategic acquisitions and investments dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors including fluctuations in our operating results which include impacts from the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions 

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue thirdparty reimbursement of our products for our customers the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts the expansion of selling general and administrative activities the timing of introductions of new products the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions investments or other business combination transactions including our pending acquisition of medifox dan and impacts from the covid19 pandemic as we assess inorganic growth strategies we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources if we are required to access the debt market we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates as part of our liquidity strategy we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels 

as of june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 2737 million and 2953 million respectively our cash and cash equivalents held within the united states at june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 were 700 million and 1067 million respectively our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30 2022 and june 30 2021 were 2037 million and 1886 million respectively our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions 

as of june 30 2022 we had 14 billion available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of 17 billion in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility 

we repatriated 1000 million and 5601 million to the united states during the years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively from earnings generated in each of those years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the united states in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2023 will be determined based on a variety of factors including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the united states such as for the repayment of debt dividend distributions and other domestic obligations 

as a result of the us tax act we treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable which resulted in additional tax expense of 1269 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years the additional tax expense associated with the us tax act was reduced to 942 million during the current year as a result of the ato settlement discussed in note 13 – income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 therefore future repatriation of 



cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax if repatriated except as discussed in note 13 – income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 

we believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations including expected capital expenditures for the next 12 months and beyond 

revolving credit agreement term credit agreement and senior notes 

on june 29 2022 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement as amended from time to time the “revolving credit agreement” the revolving credit agreement among other things provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of 15000 million with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of 10000 million and 100 times the ebitda for the trailing twelvemonth measurement period additionally on june 29 2022 resmed pty limited entered into a second amendment to the syndicated facility agreement the “term credit agreement” the term credit agreement among other things provides resmed limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of 2000 million the revolving credit agreement and term credit agreement each terminate on jun 29 2027 when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid as of june 30 2022 we had 14 billion available for draw down under the revolving credit facility 

on july 10 2019 we entered into a note purchase agreement with the purchasers to that agreement in connection with the issuance and sale of 2500 million principal amount of our 324 senior notes due july 10 2026 and 2500 million principal amount of our 345 senior notes due july 10 2029 “senior notes” 

on june 30 2022 there was a total of 7800 million outstanding under the revolving credit agreement term credit agreement and senior notes we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and longterm debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand cash generated from operations and debt facilities 

cash flow summary

refer to note 16  legal actions contingencies and commitments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 for details of our contingent obligations under recourse provisions 

segment information 

we have determined that we have two operating segments which are the sleep and respiratory care segment and the saas segment see note 14 – segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

critical accounting principles and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill potentially impaired assets intangible assets income taxes and contingencies 



we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as an impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit as described in step 1 below factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

we conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps 

step 0 or qualitative assessment – evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the factors we consider include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance or eventsspecific to that reporting unit if or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount including goodwill we would move to step 1 of the quantitative method 

step 1 – compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit if a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

during the annual reviews for the years ended june 30 2022 2021 and 2020 we completed a step 0 or qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts including goodwill and therefore goodwill was not impaired 

2 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made alternatively if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results 

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on our regular 



assessment we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

on september 19 2021 we concluded the settlement agreement with the australian taxation office “ato” in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 “ato settlement” the ato settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles 

the final net impact of the ato settlement was 2387 million which represents a gross amount of 3817 million including interest and penalties of 481 million and adjustments for credits and deductions of 1430 million as a result of the ato settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies we recorded a benefit of 141 million within other comprehensive income and a 41 million reduction of tax credits which was recorded to income tax expense as a result of the ato settlement we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position 

on september 28 2021 we remitted final payment to the ato of 2848 million consisting of the agreed settlement amount of 3817 million less prior remittances made to the ato of 969 million 

tax years 2018 to 2021 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 

3 revenue recognition we have determined that we have two operating segments which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry “sleep and respiratory care” and the supply of business management software as a service to outofhospital health providers “saas” for products in our sleep and respiratory care business we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms for our saas business revenue associated with professional services are recognized as they are provided we defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our sleep and respiratory care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our saas business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some saas contracts generally deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years our contracts do not contain significant financing components 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services in our sleep and respiratory care segment the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives eg rebates discounts free goods and returns offered to our customers and their customers when we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit returns are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience however returns of products excluding warrantyrelated returns are infrequent and insignificant we adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated the amount expected to be received changes or when the consideration becomes fixed 

we offer our sleep and respiratory care customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods we estimate rebates based on each customer’s expected achievement of its targets in accounting for these rebate programs we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and therefore no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue for rebates measured over annual periods we update our estimates on a quarterly basis based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods 

we participate in programs where we issue credits to our sleep and respiratory care distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors customers we reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method 

we also offer discounts to both our sleep and respiratory care as well as our saas customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs 



when sleep and respiratory care or saas contracts have multiple performance obligations we generally use an observable price to determine the standalone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers revenue is then allocated proportionately based on the determined standalone selling price to each performance obligation an allocation is not required for many of our sleep and respiratory care contracts that have a single performance obligation which is the shipment of our therapybased equipment

foreign currency market risk 

our reporting currency is the us dollar although the financial statements of our nonus subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies we transact business in various foreign currencies including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian and singapore manufacturing activities and international sales operations we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to hedge foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and manufacturing cash flows the goal of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures predominantly denominated in euros australian dollars and singapore dollars under this program increases or decreases in our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes the foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets current other assets noncurrent accrued expenses and other liabilities noncurrent all movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income net on our consolidated statements of income

foreign currency derivative financial instruments these notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the options contracts in thousands except exchange rates 



interest rate risk 

we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt at june 30 2022 we held cash and cash equivalents of 2737 million principally comprising of bank term deposits and atcall accounts and are invested at both shortterm fixed interest rates and variable interest rates at june 30 2022 there was 2800 million outstanding under the revolving credit and term loan facilities which were subject to variable interest rates a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during the year ended june 30 2022 would not have had a material impact on pretax income we have no interest rate hedging agreements on july 10 2019 we entered into the note purchase agreement with the purchasers to that agreement in connection with the issuance and sale of 2500 million principal amount of our 324 senior notes due july 10 2026 and 2500 million principal amount of our 345 senior notes due july 10 2029 the interest rate on these notes is fixed and not subject to fluctuation 

inflation 

inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our products freight overhead costs or wage rates may adversely affect our operating results sustained inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to offset such higher costs through price increases

we are focused on the sleep and related respiratory care markets both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated markets and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes create efficiencies for our customers help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs additionally our software solutions are focused on the outofhospital care market which we believe is fragmented and underserved and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve outofhospital healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care improving clinical decision support and driving interoperability across outofhospital care settings 

sleep and respiratory care 

sleep 

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes

a longterm epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea another study published in 2019 estimated that mild to severe osa impacts more than 936 million people worldwide including 54 million americans of those impacted it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

while sleep apnea has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population until recently it has typically been diagnosed among middleaged men who are obese however we believe the importance of sleep apnea in women is increasingly being recognized with nearly 40 of new pap patients being female a strong association has been discovered between sleep apnea and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases studies have shown that sleep apnea is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 77 of patients with obesity approximately 76 of patients with chronic heart failure and approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes 

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea   sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink air or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development 

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid1980s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air devices including our aircurve 10 series and lumis devices which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that modulate the average pressure delivered during the night 

respiratory care 

our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients with copd asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases  such as overlap syndrome obesity hypoventilation syndrome or ohs and neuromuscular disease including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als  we aim to improve their quality of life slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management 

our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from cpap systems at night to those who are dependent on noninvasive or invasive ventilation for lifesupport and those who require portable oxygen concentrators or pocs our devices are predominantly used in the home and to a lesser extent in general hospital wards and respiratory wards we supply cpap and bilevel device systems noninvasive and invasive ventilators humidifiers and accessories including masks and tubing we also offer stationary and portable batterypowered oxygen concentrators for the administration of longterm oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus or covid19 as a pandemic we have observed increased demand for our ventilator devices and masks and we are working with governments health authorities hospitals physicians and patients worldwide to assess their needs and to deliver the ventilation therapy that is essential to treat the respiratory complications of covid19 our primary focus is to maximize the availability of resmed ventilators and other respiratory support devices for the patients that need them most 

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   copd encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs it is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways symptoms encountered with copd include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production copd includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis a recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are over 380 million people worldwide who suffer from copd the world’s third leading cause of death 

patients with copd can have different clinical presentations patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen hypoxemia and elevated levels of carbon dioxide hypercapnia a chronic productive cough cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity during sleep chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia in general the more hypoxic a copd patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in copd patients and is more pronounced in rem sleep some copd patients may also suffer from comorbid osa a condition known as overlap syndrome 

home noninvasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe copd by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions 

overlap syndrome   in patients with overlap syndrome cpap has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange noninvasive ventilation or niv has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of copd through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing it may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilatorassociated pneumonia in patients with stable copd the advantages of home niv are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and healthrelated qualityoflife measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays

longterm oxygen therapy or ltot is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients the administration of ltot has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia in hypoxemic copd patients ltot is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and also associated with improved healthrelated quality of life measures in longterm copd survivors with a history of congestive heart failure ltot is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression 

obesity hypoventilation syndrome   ohs is characterized by the combination of obesity chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sleep apnea after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation an estimated 90 of patients with ohs also have osa in patients with ohs positive airway therapy both cpap and niv has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive 

neuromuscular disease   neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology or indirectly via nerve pathology impair the functioning of muscles symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue dysphagia dyspnoea on exertion and at rest sleepiness morning headache difficulties with concentration and mood changes most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation being wheelchairbound swallowing difficulties respiratory muscle weakness and eventually death from respiratory failure neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly rapidly progressive conditions  such as als and duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years variable or slowly progressive conditions such as myotonic muscular dystrophy are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy 

niv treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases in als patients niv treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures sleeprelated symptoms and survival studies have demonstrated that patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with niv treatment 

software as a service 

due to multiple acquisitions including brightree in april 2016 healthcare first in july 2018 and matrixcare in november 2018 our operations now include platforms that comprise our saas business our saas strategy is to develop a portfolio that assists durable medical equipment or dme hme and other longterm care providers operate more effectively and efficiently across various outofhospital care settings our saas portfolio provides services across the hme home health and hospice skilled nursing life plan community and senior living and private duty services our offerings can help providers perform analytics manage documentation and implement new reimbursement requirements as well as more effectively transfer data as patients move between different care settings 

business strategy 

we believe that the sleep apnea and respiratory care markets will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa csa and copd improved understanding of the role of sleep apnea treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders improved understanding of the role of noninvasive ventilation in the management of copd and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers additionally the continued impact of covid19 or a resurgence of covid19 may create more demand for our ventilator products our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sleep apnea and respiratory care markets as well as growth in outofhospital care settings consists of the following key elements 

 continue product development and innovation in sleep apnea products we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea we have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sleep apnea more effectively increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy in recent years we have introduced a full suite of masks in our airtouch and airfit ranges advanced and expanded the integrations of our therapybased software solutions including airview to promote greater patient adherence and during the covid19 pandemic we released resmed maskselector in the united states an easyto use digital tool to make mask selection and sizing easier and more effective both remotely and during inperson clinical setups  we believe that the combination of continued product development product and technology acquisitions and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success our recent acquisitions have included a portfolio of sleep apnea products through our acquisition of curative medical  approximately 16 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities

our main manufacturing facilities are located in loyang singapore sydney australia chatsworth california johor bahru malaysia atlanta georgia and suzhou china we are establishing a new manufacturing facility in tuas singapore that will eventually replace our loyang facility refer to item 2 for additional details on these properties 

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany and korea we receive payments directly from these payors but in other countries although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors our success in major markets depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our products 

  

 10  

  



  

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics who invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia china and some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

healthcare reform in the united states continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape in 2011 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms implemented the competitive bidding program which included dme that we manufacture and develop specifically oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices or bilevel devices and related supplies and accessories cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years in addition the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act or collectively the aca required cms to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in noncompetitive bidding areas also known as the nonbid or round 3 areas to match competitive bidding prices by 2016 cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and the rates became fully effective july 1 2016 the implementation of the competitive acquisition program has resulted in reduced medicare payment for oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and noncompetitive bidding areas through an interim final rule issued in may 2018 cms increased the fee schedule amounts for certain dme in nonbid areas that qualify as rural and noncontiguous setting payment for these areas for june 1 2018 to december 31 2018 at a 5050 blended reimbursement rate based on the precompetitive bidding reimbursement rate and the adjusted reimbursement rate set through competitive bidding 

due to the lapse of competitive bid contracts as of december 31 2018 effective january 1 2019 medicare beneficiaries may receive dme from any medicareenrolled supplier until new contracts are in effect under the next round of competitive bidding which is expected to take effect on january 1 2021 pricing in competitive bidding areas and nonrural contiguous nonbid areas will continue to use adjusted fee schedule amounts subject to annual consumer price index cpi adjustments beginning in 2019 until the next bidding round takes place cms also extended the blended fee schedule amounts for nonbid rural and noncontiguous areas through december 31 2020 under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act or the cares act the blended fee schedule amounts for nonbid rural and noncontiguous areas was extended through the end of the covid19 public health emergency should it extend beyond december 31 2020 and a blended fee schedule amount was implemented for all other areas for the same period 

in the next round of durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos competitive bidding program expected to take effect on january 1 2021 there have been some revisions to the bidding methodology including the plan to implement surety bond requirements lead item pricing and setting reimbursement rates at the maximum winning bid rate instead of the median winning bid rate although cms previously expanded the categories of devices subject to competitive bidding to include noninvasive ventilators or nivs starting in 2021 in response to the covid19 pandemic cms removed nivs from round 2021 of the dmepos competitive bidding program 

the aca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources also included among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 however this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the us congress for medical device sales beginning in 2016 and permanently repealed effective january 1 2020 the aca also provided for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for dme and home health services

we cannot predict at this time the full impact that the aca or any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca as well as recent efforts by the trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the aca and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 includes a provision repealing effective january 1 2019 the taxbased shared responsibility payment imposed by the aca on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” on december 14 2018 a us district court judge in the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the aca and therefore because it was repealed as part of the us tax act the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well on december 18 2019 the us court of appeals for the 5th circuit upheld the district court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well on march 2 2020 the us supreme court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case although it is unclear when or how the supreme court will rule it is also unclear how other efforts to challenge repeal or replace the aca will impact the law or our business 

service and warranty 

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our devices in some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

competition 

the markets for our products and services are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features valueadded solutions reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them 

our primary sleep and respiratory care competitors include philips bv fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited devilbiss healthcare apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional manufacturers finally our products compete with surgical procedures nerve stimulation devices and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sleep apnearelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

for our saas business the market is highly competitive rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services the development of new or innovative solutions by others could result in our solutions becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

any product developed by us will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products and solutions accordingly the speed with which we can develop products and solutions complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and provide commercial supply of products and solutions to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

we rely on a combination of patents designs trademarks trade secrets copyrights and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products we believe the combination of these rights in aggregate are of material importance to each of our businesses through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this report we own or have licensed rights to over 6200 pending allowed or granted patents and designs patents and designs have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change of our patents 570 us patents and 1452 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position

litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

government regulations 

fda 

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed pursuant to 510k premarketing clearances and are either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 

eea 

in the european economic area which is comprised of the 27 member states of the european union plus norway iceland and liechtenstein or eea manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the essential requirements laid out in annex i to the eu medical devices directive council directive 9342eec compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the ce mark to medical devices without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the eea to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the ce mark manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i with no measuring function and which are not sterile where the manufacturer can issue an ec declaration of conformity based on a selfassessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an eea country to conduct conformity assessments depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure the notified body would audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of the devices the notified body issues a ce certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements this certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the ce mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related ec declaration of conformity 

as a general rule demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based among other things on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use specifically a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence 

all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the eea must comply with the eu medical device vigilance system under this system incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the member states of the eea and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions or fscas to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market an incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics andor performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which directly or indirectly might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health an fsca may include the recall modification exchange destruction or retrofitting of the device fscas must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers andor to the end users of the device through field safety notices where appropriate our products commercialized in europe are ce marked and classified as either class i or class ii 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation

the medical device regulation was meant to become applicable three years after publication in may 2020 however on april 23 2020 to allow eea national authorities notified bodies manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the covid19 pandemic the european council and parliament adopted regulation 2020561 postponing the date of application of the medical device regulation by one year to may 2021 once applicable the new regulations will among other things 

 s trengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available 

 e stablish explicit provisions on manufacturers responsibilities for the followup of the quality performance and safety of devices placed on the market 

 i mprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the enduser or patient through a unique identification number 

 s et up a central database to provide patients healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the eu and 

 s trengthen rules for the assessment of certain highrisk devices such as implants which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market 

these modifications may have an impact on the way we design and manufacture products and the way we conduct our business in the eea we are progressing in our plans to meet the new requirements 

other regulatory bodies 

our devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the therapeutic goods administration in australia health canada in canada and cfda in china 

other healthcare laws 

we are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation violations of the federal antikickback statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation plus up to three times the remuneration involved violations of the federal antikickback statute can also result in criminal penalties including significant criminal fines and imprisonment in addition violations can result in debarment suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid 

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act when an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil false claims act the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties for each false claim plus treble damages and exclude the entity from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs private suits filed under the civil false claims act known as qui tam actions can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government these individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 

the federal civil monetary penalties law prohibits among other things the offering or transfer of remuneration to a medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by medicare or a state healthcare program unless an exception applies 

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

the federal physician sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs biologicals and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the fda and for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program to report annually to the cms information related to i payments and other transfers of value to teaching hospitals physicians as defined by statute and beginning in 2022 physician assistants nurse practitioners and other practitioners and ii ownership and investment interests held by such providers and their immediate family members applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to cms failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each failure and additional penalties for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely accurately and completely reported in an annual submission and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation 

also many us states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs 

under hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech which we collectively refer to as hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations  including the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules to protect the privacy and security of protected health information  or phi used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates  hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties for each violation in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of personally identifiable information that are applicable to our business for example the california consumer privacy act or the ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that term is broadly defined and provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation although the law includes limited exceptions including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context ccpa’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states 

in some of our operations such as those involving our cloudbased software digital health applications we are a business associate under hipaa and therefore required to comply with the hipaa security rule breach notification rule and certain provisions of the hipaa privacy rule as well as the terms of our business associate agreements that we enter into with our covered entity customers and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 

in addition the general data protection regulation or gdpr went into effect in may 2018 the gdpr imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data in the european economic area or eea the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and has increased our obligations for example by imposing higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data requiring more robust disclosures to individuals strengthening individual data rights shortening timelines for data breach notifications limiting retention periods and secondary use of information including for research purposes  increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eea including to the united states recent legal developments in europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states for example on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union or cjeu invalidated the euus privacy shield framework or privacy shield under which personal data could be transferred from the eea to united states entities that had self

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

certified under the privacy shield scheme while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place however the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain european data protection law provides that eea member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase and harm our business and financial condition the gdpr and other similar regulations impose additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent for electronic marketing such as a prohibition on prechecked tick boxes and bundled consents thereby requiring customers to affirmatively consent for a given purpose through separate tick boxes or other affirmative action failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the eea member states may result in fines of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation  

further following the united kingdom’s departure from the eu and eea on january 31 2020 and the end of the transition period on december 31 2020 we will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom domestic law the data protection act 2018 the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules if we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

numerous other state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of patient health information in addition congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information with the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach such as prompt disclosure to affected customers generally these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches the federal trade commission or ftc and states’ attorneys general have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair andor deceptive acts or practices under the ftc act in addition to data breach notification laws some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information these laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies we intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information 

the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations 

employees 

as of june 30 2020 we had approximately 7770 employees or fulltime consultants of which approximately 3490 were employed in cost of sales activities including areas such as warehousing and manufacturing 1280 in research and development and 3000 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 3030 were located in the united states canada and latin america 1560 in australia 1260 in europe and 1920 in asia we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

 item 1a risk factors 

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business   the markets for our products which encompass sleep and respiratory care products and saas offerings are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products for our sleep and respiratory care business the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat for saas the market for business management software is highly competitive rapidly evolving subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current business management software into their operations and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to change from their current solution or provider to one of our platforms or products 

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics   we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

we have expanded our marketing activities in some markets to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations   many home health care dealers and outofhospital health providers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer   as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by the effects of the covid19 pandemic   we are subject to risks related to the global pandemic associated with covid19 which may have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our business specifically diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment including physician practices hme suppliers and sleep clinics have been impacted and in some instances been required  or in the future may be required to temporarily close due to governments’ “ shelterinplace ” orders  quarantines or similar orders or restrictions enacted to control the spread of covid19  in some countries new patients are prescribed sleep apnea treatment through hospitals that are directing their resources to critical care including covid19 treatment the impact on these diagnostic and prescription pathways has resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in demand for our products designed to treat sleep apnea 

while we have experienced increased demand for our respiratory care products due to the nature of covid19 we cannot guarantee that demand will continue or that we will be able to identify and obtain adequate raw materials or otherwise maintain operations supply chains and distribution systems to satisfy demand for our products in a costeffective manner or at all additionally if the increase in demand currently being experienced for our respiratory care products declines more abruptly than expected this could adversely impact our inventory levels and may result in excess inventory which we may be unable to sell furthermore due to governments’ varying restrictions on international and domestic travel access to labor for our manufacturing facilities could be adversely impacted 

our saas business may also be affected by covid19 and measures taken to control the spread of covid19 some of our existing and potential saas customers are hme distributors and therefore have been impacted or may be impacted by the same temporary business closures noted above we also have existing and potential saas customers that operate care facilities and are either receiving and treating patients infected with covid19 or are implementing significant measures to safeguard their facilities against a potential covid19 outbreak given these challenging business conditions and the uncertain economic environment we expect businesses will be deterred from adopting new or changing saas platforms which may adversely impact our ability to engage new customers for our saas businesses or expand the services used by existing customers 

additionally the types of restrictions enacted to control the spread of covid19 have resulted in most of our employees working from home and have resulted or may result in the employees of our key suppliers and customers working from home or as noted above not working at all neither we nor our suppliers have significant experience operating with the majority of our work forces working from home and this may disrupt our standard operations or significantly hamper our products from moving through our supply chain if we are unable to move products efficiently through the supply chain we may be unable to satisfy customer demand which could negatively impact our results of operations 

health regulatory agencies globally may also experience disruptions in their operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic any delay or deprioritization of our product development activities or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect our results of operations 

in addition to existing travel restrictions countries may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel which may also disrupt our ability to move our product by air and sea the continued spread of covid19 has also led to extreme disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which increases the cost of and adversely impacts access to capital and increases economic uncertainty while we expect covid19 to negatively impact certain aspects of our business given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus and the uncertainty about its impact on society and the global economy we cannot predict the extent to which it will affect our global operations particularly if these impacts persist or worsen over an extended period of time 

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability   we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales in combined europe asia and other markets accounted for approximately 38 and 39 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2020 and june 30 2019 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 3540 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

 fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

 tariffs and other trade barriers

 compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations 

 difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems 

 reduction in thirdparty payor reimbursement for our products 

 inability to obtain import licenses 

 the impact of public health epidemicspandemics on the global economy such as covid19 that has spread globally 

 changes in trade policies and in us and foreign tax policies 

 possible changes in export or import restrictions and 

 the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects 

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

if we fail to effectively integrate and capitalize on our acquisitions combining them with our other saas operations our saas businesses could suffer   part of our growth strategy includes acquiring businesses consistent with our commitment to innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea and respiratory care as well as our saas business for example we acquired matrixcare in november 2018 and propeller health in january 2019 the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the business and operations of the acquired companies  additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

we have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions that may prove to be materially inaccurate we have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions including matrixcare such as 

 projections of each acquired company’s future revenue 

 the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from our acquisitions 

 acquisition costs including transaction contingent consideration and integration costs and

our saas business depends substantially on customers entering into renewing upgrading and expanding their agreements for cloud services term licenses and maintenance and support agreements with us any decline in our customer renewals upgrades or expansions could adversely affect our future operating results   we typically enter into termbased agreements for our licensed onpremises offerings cloud services and maintenance and support services which customers have discretion to renew or terminate at the end of the initial term in order for us to improve our operating results it is important that new customers enter into renewable agreements and our existing customers renew upgrade and expand their termbased agreements when the initial contract term expires our customers have no obligation to renew upgrade or expand their agreements with us after the terms have expired our customers’ renewal upgrade and expansion rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our offerings our pricing the effects of general economic conditions competitive offerings or alterations or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our customers do not renew upgrade or expand their agreements with us or renew on terms less favorable to us our revenues may decline

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products   our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep apnea conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma under the program our customers who provide hme must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas in addition under the aca in 2016 cms adjusted the prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and were fully effective july 1 2016 this program has significantly reduced the medicare reimbursement to our customers compared with reimbursement in 2011 at the beginning of the program the 21st century cures act retroactively adjusted rates in nonbid areas to allow for the higher phasein rates to be paid for items furnished between july 1 2016 and december 31 2016 rather than the lower fullyadjusted rates rules issued by cms in 2018 resumed the higher phasein rates in rural and noncontiguous noncompetitive bidding areas for items furnished between june 1 2018 and december 31 2020 pursuant to the cares act these higher phasein rates were extended through december 31 2020 or through the end of the covid19 public health emergency and were implemented in areas other than rural areas and noncontiguous areas for the same period on march 7 2019 cms announced it would initiate a new round of competitive bidding named round 2021 with contracts expected to become effective on january 1 2021 and extend through december 31 2023 in addition to adopting new bidding processes cms expanded the product categories included in competitive bidding to include noninvasive ventilators in addition to oxygen however d ue to the covid19 pandemic cms removed nivs from round 2021 of the dmepos competitive bidding program cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories which had been included in prior rounds of competitive bidding remain included in round 2021 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition if changes are made to this program in the future it could affect amounts being recovered by our customers 

healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations   in march 2010 the aca was signed into law in the united states the aca made changes that significantly impacted the healthcare industry including medical device manufacturers  one of the principal purposes of the aca was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of americans who were uninsured the aca required adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate 

the aca also contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this included new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax was applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products through a series of legislative amendments the tax was suspended beginning in 2016 and permanently repealed effective january 1 2020 in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the aca also included among other things demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payors for our products and decreased profits to us

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted these changes included an aggregate reduction in medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 the cares act which was signed into law in march 2020 suspended the payment reductions from may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and extended the sequester by one additional year through 2030 in addition on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

the full impact on our business of the aca and other new laws is uncertain nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted if any or how such changes would affect the demand for our products future actions by the administration and the us congress including but not limited to repeal or replacement of the aca could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge for example on december 14 2018 a us district court judge in the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the aca and therefore because it was repealed as part of the us tax act the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well on december 18 2019 the us court of appeals for the 5th circuit upheld the district court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well on march 2 2020 the united states supreme court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case although it remains unclear when or how the supreme court will rule it is also unclear how other efforts to challenge repeal or replace the aca will impact the aca or our business 

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states the aca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations   although in the united states we do not provide healthcare services submit claims for thirdparty reimbursement or receive payments directly from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors for our products we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country 

in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to 

 the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or paying remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate the antikickback statute itself to have committed a violation the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us violations of the federal antikickback statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation plus up to three times the remuneration involved violations of the federal antikickback statute can also result in significant criminal penalties and imprisonment 

 federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws that prohibit among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage  coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill thirdparty payors in addition the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act violations can result in debarment suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid when an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil false claims act the government may impose significant civil fines and penalties for each false claim plus treble damages and exclude the entity from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs

 hipaa which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation further failure to comply with the hipaa privacy and security standards can result in significant civil monetary penalties per violation and in certain circumstances significant criminal penalties andor imprisonment 

 the federal physician sunshine act requirements under the aca which impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed by certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics  and medical supplies to physicians including doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided as well as ownership and investment interests held during the previous year to physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives 

 federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers and 

 state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as state antikickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including commercial insurers state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures 

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these types of investigations healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs additional compliance and reporting obligations imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our ope rations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

in december 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with the us department of justice and the us attorneys’ offices for the district court of south carolina the southern district of california the northern district of iowa and the eastern district of new york the agreement resolves five lawsuits originally brought by whistleblowers under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act and allegations that we a provided dme companies with free telephone call center services and other free patient outreach services that enabled these companies to order resupplies for their patients with sleep apnea b provided sleep labs with free and belowcost positive airway pressure masks and diagnostic machines as well as free installation of these machines c arranged for and fully guaranteed the payments due on interestfree loans that dme supplies acquired from thirdparty financial institutions for the purchase of our equipment and d provided nonsleep specialist physicians free home sleep testing devices referred to as “apnealink” we agreed with the government to civilly resolve these matters for a payment of 395 million 375 million to the federal government and 2 million to the various states and we incurred additional fees and administrative costs that typically accompany such a resolution amounting to 11 million the total final costs relating to these matters was 406 million 

contemporaneous with the civil settlement we also entered into a corporate integrity agreement or cia with the department of health and human services office of inspector general the cia requires among other things that we implement additional controls around our product pricing and sales and that we conduct internal and external monitoring of our arrangements with referrals sources the settlement agreement with the government and the cia could result in reputational harm the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and an increase in our compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our financial results and our ability to operate our business

our use and disclosure of individually identifiable information including health information is subject to federal state and foreign privacy and security regulations and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm   the privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored maintained received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies legal standards for privacy including but not limited to “unfairness” and “deception” as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose audience and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business recently there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacyrelated lawsuits filed against companies concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business 

numerous foreign federal and state laws and regulations govern collection dissemination use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information including i state privacy and confidentiality laws including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches ii hipaa and iii european and other foreign data protection laws including the gdpr 

hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information or protected health information by health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically or covered entities and their “business associates” which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involve creating receiving maintaining or transmitting protected health information certain portions of our business such as the cloudbased software digital health applications are subject to hipaa as a business associate of our covered entity clients to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve access to phi hipaa requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa as a business associate we are also directly liable for compliance with hipaa penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties 

hipaa authorizes state attorneys’ general to file suit under hipaa on behalf of state residents courts can award damages costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of hipaa in such cases while hipaa does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for hipaa violations its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of phi 

hipaa further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” covered entities must notify affected individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” if their unsecured phi is subject to an unauthorized access use or disclosure if a breach affects 500 patients or more covered entities must report it to hhs and local media without unreasonable delay and hhs will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website if a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals the covered entity must log it and notify hhs at least annually 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us our solutions may be perceived as not secure we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients we are liable not only contractually but also directly under hipaa

in addition the california consumer privacy act of 2018 or ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers as that term is broadly defined and provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa includes civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation although the law includes limited exceptions including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context ccpa’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and the ccpa may increase our compliance costs and potential liability any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may also result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in nonus countries covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information for example eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time 

in addition the gdpr went into effect in may 2018 the gdpr imposes stringent data protection requirements for the processing of personal data in the european economic area or eea the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and increased our obligations for example by imposing higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data requiring more robust disclosures to individuals strengthening individual data rights shortening timelines for data breach notifications limiting retention periods and secondary use of information including for research purposes  increasing requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data and imposing additional obligations when we contract with third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eea including to the united states and recent legal developments in europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers of personal data from the eea to the united states for example on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union or cjeu invalidated the euus privacy shield framework or privacy shield under which personal data could be transferred from the eea to united states entities that had selfcertified under the privacy shield scheme while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a casebycase basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures andor contractual provisions may need to be put in place however the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain european data protection law provides that eea member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase and harm our business and financial condition the gdpr and other similar regulations impose additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent for electronic marketing such as a prohibition on prechecked tick boxes and bundled consents thereby requiring customers to affirmatively consent for a given purpose through separate tick boxes or other affirmative action failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the eea member states may result in fines of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation  

in addition following the united kingdom’s departure from the eu and the eea on january 31 2020 and the end of the transition period on december 31 2020 we will have to comply with the gdpr and the gdpr as incorporated into the united kingdom domestic law the data protection act 2018 the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £175 million or 4 of global turnover compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules if we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our business activities are subject to extensive regulation and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   we are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore certain of our products could be subject to recall if the food and drug administration or the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that those products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

actual or attempted breaches of security unauthorized disclosure of information denial of service attacks or the perception that personal andor other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure could result in a material loss of business substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation   we receive collect process use and store a large amount of information from clients and our own employees including personally identifiable protected health and other sensitive and confidential information this data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks including the internet the secure transmission of such information over the internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems we have implemented security measures technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify detect and prevent unauthorized access alteration use or disclosure of our clients’ patients’ and employees’ data however the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities beyond external criminal activity systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations 

if someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems they could steal any information located therein or cause serious and potentially long lasting disruption to our operations security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss andor litigation fines and sanctions we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data while we maintain insurance that covers certain security and privacy breaches we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability 

we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security including hipaa and european data privacy laws complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny fines and civil liability in addition any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information additional costs associated with repairing any system damage incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches including organizational changes deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies employee training and engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants additionally the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 

we cannot assure you that any of our thirdparty service providers with access to our or our clients andor employees’ personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof which could have a corresponding effect on our business 

if there are interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology or infrastructure our existing saas customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our platform   we depend on services from various third parties as well as our own technical operations infrastructure to distribute our saas products via the internet if a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform or otherwise experiences service outages such failure could interrupt our customers’ access to our service which could adversely affect their perception of our platforms reliability and our revenues any disruptions in these services including as a result of actions outside of our control would significantly impact the continued performance of our saas products in the future these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all any loss of the right to use any of these services could result in decreased functionality of our saas products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or if available from another provider is identified obtained and integrated into our infrastructure

to meet our business needs we must maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to ensure that our saas products are accessible design and mechanical errors spikes in usage volume and failure to follow system protocols and procedures could cause our systems to fail resulting in interruptions in our saas products any interruptions or delays in our service whether or not caused by our products or as a result of thirdparty error our own error natural disasters or security breaches whether accidental or willful could harm our relationships with customers and cause our revenue to decrease andor our expenses to increase 

any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation cause customers to terminate their agreements with us impair our ability to obtain contract renewals from existing customers impair our ability to grow our customer base result in the expenditure of significant financial technical and engineering resources subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline   unless a product is exempt before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process for example in november 2018 fda officials announced forthcoming steps that the fda intends to take to modernize the 510k premarket notification pathway among other things the fda announced that it plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510k pathway toward the use of newer predicates these proposals include plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510k clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old in september 2019 the fda also issued revised final guidance establishing a “safety and performance based pathway” for “manufacturers of certain wellunderstood device types” allowing manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the fda to demonstrate substantial equivalence obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process the fda intends to develop and maintain a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop productspecific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria and recommended testing methodologies for each such device type where feasible some of these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted and the fda announced that it would seek public feedback prior to publication of any such proposals and may work with congress to implement such proposals through legislation accordingly it is unclear the extent to which any proposals if adopted could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business 

the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing stricter requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies

disruptions at the fda and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all which could negatively impact our business   the ability of the fda to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels statutory regulatory and policy changes the fda’s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and other events that may otherwise affect the fda’s ability to perform routine functions average review times at the fda have fluctuated in recent years as a result in addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable disruptions at the fda and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved medical devices to be reviewed andor approved by necessary government agencies which would adversely affect our business for example over the last several years including for 35 days beginning on december 22 2018 the us government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the fda have had to furlough critical fda employees and stop critical activities 

separately in response to the covid19 pandemic on march 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and subsequently on march 18 2020 the fda temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities regulatory authorities outside the united states may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the covid19 pandemic subsequently on july 10 2020 the fda announced its intention to resume certain onsite inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a riskbased prioritization system the fda intends to use this riskbased assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities if a prolonged government shutdown occurs or if global health concerns continue to prevent the fda or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections reviews or other regulatory activities it could significantly impact the ability of the fda or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities   our business activities include contacts with consumers in different parts of the world certain laws such as the us telephone consumer protection act regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts with consumers such as phone calls texts or emails our use of outbound contacts may be restricted by existing laws or by laws regulations or regulatory decisions that may be adopted in the future similarly the new california consumer privacy act of 2018 requires disclosure of our privacy practices to consumers if we are found to have violated these laws or regulations we may be subjected to substantial fines penalties or liabilities to consumers

our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   as a part of the regulatory process to obtain marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products or for other reasons we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints we our competitors or other third parties may also conduct clinical trials involving our commercially marketed products the results of clinical trials may be unfavorable or inconsistent with previous findings or could identify safety signals associated with our products current or future clinical trials may not meet primary endpoints may reveal disadvantages of our products and solutions for various markets we address or could generate unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data clinical data or the market’s or regulatory bodies’ perception of the clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product clearances or approvals and our position in and share of the markets in which we participate moreover if these clinical trials identify serious safety issues associated with our marketed products potentially adverse consequences could result including that regulatory authorities could withdraw clearances or approvals of our products we could be required to halt the marketing and sales of our products or recall our products we could be required to update our product labeling with additional warnings we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our reputation may suffer any of these could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties   the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fdacleared products in particular clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 

disruptions in the supply of components from our suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability   we purchase configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us disruptions to our suppliers including disruptions in connection with the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 may limit our ability to manufacture our devices in a timely or costeffective manner which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices in a timely or costeffective manner which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

if we fail to attract develop and retain key employees our business may suffer   our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing technology and rd positions competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions if we cannot effectively recruit develop and retain qualified employees to drive our strategic goals our business could suffer 

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims   we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business

if our saas products fail to perform properly and if we fail to develop enhancements we could lose customers become subject to service performance or warranty claims and our market share could decline   our saas operations are dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruptions and as we continue to grow we will need to devote additional resources to improving our infrastructure in order to maintain the performance of our products and solutions the applications underlying our saas products are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors which may cause disruptions in availability or other performance problems we have from time to time found defects in our products and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in data unavailability unauthorized access to loss corruption or other harm to our customers’ data while we implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance we may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before implementing our products and solutions consequently we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our products and solutions have been deployed if we fail to perform timely maintenance or if customers are otherwise dissatisfied with the frequency andor duration of our maintenance services and related system outages our existing customers could elect not to renew their contracts delay or withhold payment or potential customers may not adopt our products and solutions and our brand and reputation could be harmed in addition the occurrence of any material defects errors disruptions in service or other performance problems with our software could result in warranty or other legal claims against us and diversion of our resources the costs incurred in addressing and correcting any material defects or errors in our software and expanding our infrastructure and architecture in order to accommodate increased demand for our products and solutions may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results 

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties   we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products we face the risks that 

 thirdparties will infringe our intellectual property rights 

 our nondisclosure agreements will be breached 

 we will not have adequate remedies for infringement 

 our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors or 

 thirdparties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our products 

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed on proprietary rights of others if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

tax laws regulations and enforcement practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position   tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and aggressive positions taken by tax authorities 

changes or clarifications to us tax laws could materially affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment hybrid entities and instruments transfer pricing and tax treaties the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations

developments in relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices and enforcement practices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows including the need to obtain additional financing 

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions   our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that require significant judgment and are subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

in connection with the audit by the australian taxation office or ato for the tax years 2009 to 2013 we received notices of amended assessments in march 2018 based on these assessments the ato asserted that we owe 1517 million in additional income tax and 384 million in accrued interest we agreed to a payment arrangement with the ato whereby an amount of 759 million was paid by us in april 2018 with the remaining amounts due only if we are unsuccessful in defending our position in june 2018 we received a notice from the ato claiming penalties of 50 of the additional income tax that was assessed or 759 million in accordance with the payment arrangement all remaining tax interest and penalty amounts outstanding are due only if we are unsuccessful in defending our position we do not agree with the ato’s assessments and intend to pursue administrative and legal steps to defend our position we continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position however if we are not successful there may be material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets we will not receive a refund of the 759 million we paid in april 2018 and we will be required to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results the ato is currently auditing tax years 2014 to 2018 and may advance the position that additional taxes are owed for those years as well 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons   our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

 the introduction of new products by us or our competitors 

 the geographic mix of product sales 

 the success and costs of our marketing efforts in new regions 

 changes in thirdparty payor reimbursement 

 timing of regulatory clearances and approvals 

 costs associated with acquiring and integrating new businesses technologies and product offerings 

 timing of orders by distributors 

 expenditures incurred for research and development 

 competitive pricing in different regions 

 the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses and 

 other activities of our competitors 

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline   our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters including covid19 that has spread globally and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us   provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors   a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally some of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of their assets as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition investors may not be able to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in nonus courts where most of these assets and persons reside 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure   our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets   recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile commodity prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability 

our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business   as of june 30 2020 our total consolidated debt was 12 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 making it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations 

 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions 

 limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditure acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

 exposing us to greater interest rate risk 

our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness which could impede our growth our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control

we may be adversely affected by recent proposals to reform libor   certain of our financial arrangements including credit facilities are made at variable interest rates that use the london interbank offered rate or libor or metrics derived from or related to libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021 these reforms may cause libor to cease to exist new methods of calculating libor to be established or alternative reference rates to be established the alternative reference rates committee arrc has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate sofr is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to libor for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to united states dollar libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to libor uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of sofr as the primary alternative to libor and the potential consequences to us cannot be fully predicted changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows 

we may impair intangible assets such as goodwill   we have recorded intangible assets including goodwill in connection with our acquisitions at least on an annual basis we will evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the values of these intangible assets as circumstances change we cannot assure you that the value of these intangible assets will be realized by us if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred we will be required to writeoff the impaired portion of intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the writeoff occurs

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” as a pandemic our primary goal during the covid19 pandemic is the preservation of life we have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our employees and continuing to use our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the challenges the pandemic poses 

we have observed increased demand for our ventilator devices and masks which can be used to treat covid19 patients due to governments’ varying restrictions on international and domestic travel access to labor for our manufacturing facilities was impacted as was the availability of raw materials and components which constrained our manufacturing capacity and restricted our ability to initially meet the substantial demand for ventilators our primary focus is maximizing the availability of our ventilators and other respiratory support devices for the patients that need them the most in the countries facing the greatest challenges the global increase in our sales for these respiratory care products during fiscal year 2020 generally followed infection patterns around the world we believe the global demand for these devices has largely been met however this may change depending on the ability for regions to contain and control infection rates which remains highly uncertain additionally as more becomes known about the virus and as governments pursue testing and vaccines we may see an overall reduction in demand and then face a corresponding risk of oversupply by us and by our competitors while further outbreaks in the future are highly uncertain we expect lower demand for ventilator products for the fiscal year ending june 30 2021 

as anticipated we observed lower demand for our sleep devices and masks during the three months ended june 30 2020 and we continue to expect covid19 will lead to a temporary decrease in demand for these products from new patients for some or all of our fiscal year 2021 specifically diagnostic pathways for sleep apnea treatment including hme suppliers and sleep clinics have been impacted and in some instances been required or in the future may be required to temporarily close due to governments’ “shelterinplace” orders quarantines or similar orders or restrictions enacted to control the spread of covid19 in some countries new patients are prescribed sleep apnea treatment through hospitals that are directing their resources to critical care including covid19 treatment the impact on these diagnostic and prescription pathways has likely resulted in a decrease in demand from new patients for our products designed to treat sleep apnea given the ongoing uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the covid19 pandemic and measures taken to control the spread of covid19 we are uncertain as to the duration and extent of decreased demand for our sleep devices however due to the nature of the installed base of existing patients using our devices we expect the demand for resupply of our masks to be less impacted compared to devices 

our saas business may also be affected by covid19 and measures taken to control the spread of covid19 some of our existing and potential saas customers are hme distributors and therefore have been impacted or may be impacted by the same temporary business closures noted above we also have existing and potential saas customers that operate care facilities and are either receiving and treating patients infected with covid19 or are implementing significant measures to safeguard their facilities against a potential covid19 outbreak given these challenging business conditions and the uncertain economic environment we expect businesses will be deterred from adopting new or changing saas platforms which may adversely impact our ability to engage new customers for our saas businesses or expand the services used by existing customers 

our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees we have endeavored and continue to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide but since covid19 was declared a pandemic in march 2020 we were able to broadly maintain our operations and we are beginning the slow and careful process of progressively returning to work in our offices around the world the pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity position

net revenue from our saas business for the year ended june 30 2020 was 3546 million compared to 2758 million for the year ended june 30 2019 an increase of 788 million or 29 the increase was predominantly due to revenue attributable to matrixcare which was acquired on november 13 2018 and continued growth in our saas product offerings 

gross profit and gross margin   within our consolidated statements of income for the years ended june 30 2020 2019 and 2018 cost of sales has been adjusted to include amortization of acquired intangible assets directly applicable to revenue as a result gross profit now includes amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales and operating expenses have been reduced by this amount there was no impact on income from operations income before taxes or net income as a result of this reclassification the adjustments to the previously reported amounts are not material

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2020 to 6767 million from 6450 million for the year ended june 30 2019 an increase of 317 million or 5 the selling general and administrative expenses as reported in us dollars were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the us dollar which decreased our expenses by approximately 151 million excluding the impact of foreign currency movements selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2020 increased by 7 compared to the year ended june 30 2019 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2020 improved to 229 compared to 247 for the year ended june 30 2019 

the constant currency increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of our acquisitions of matrixcare and propeller health partially offset by a decrease in legal costs and travel marketing and consulting expenses either as a direct or indirect result of the covid19 pandemic

amortization of acquired intangible assets   amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2020 totaled 301 million compared to 324 million for the year ended june 30 2019 the decrease in amortization expense was attributable to our historical intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the fiscal year 

restructuring expenses   during the year ended june 30 2020 we did not incur material restructuring expenses during the year ended june 30 2019 we incurred restructuring expenses of 94 million associated with the reorganization rationalization and relocation of some of our research and development and saas operations including the closure of our german research and development site we recorded the full amount of 94 million during the year ended june 30 2019 within our operating expenses which was separately disclosed as restructuring expenses the restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance payments to employees and contract exit costs associated with several impacted sites 

acquisition related expenses during the year ended june 30 2020 we did not incur material acquisition related expenses during the year ended june 30 2019 we recognized acquisition related expenses of 61 million associated primarily with our acquisition of matrixcare 

litigation settlement expenses   during the year ended june 30 2020 we did not incur material litigation settlement expenses during the year ended june 30 2019 we recognized litigation settlement expenses of 412 million on account of a tentative agreement with the department of justice to resolve an ongoing investigation by the government into certain of our product offerings the final agreement entered into in december 2019 included payment by us of 395 million and additional fees and administrative costs raising the overall total to 412 million 

total other income loss net   total other income loss net for the year ended june 30 2020 was a loss of 766 million compared to a loss of 604 million for the year ended june 30 2019 the change was due primarily to an increase in losses attributable to equity method investments for the year ended june 30 2020 of 251 million compared to 158 million for the year ended june 30 2019 the losses attributable to equity method investments relate to our joint venture with verily whereby we recognize our share of the joint venture’s losses additionally interest expense increased to 404 million for the year ended june 30 2020 compared to interest expense of 362 million for the year ended june 30 2019 

income taxes   our effective income tax rate decreased to 152 for the year ended june 30 2020 from 220 for the year ended june 30 2019 our effective income tax rate was affected by the geographic mix of our earnings and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee sharebased awards our singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30 2030 as a result of the us tax act we treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable during the year ended june 30 2018 therefore future repatriation of cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax if repatriated 

finally in connection with the audit by the australian tax office the “ato” for the tax years 2009 to 2013 we received notices of amended assessments in march 2018 based on these assessments the ato asserted that we owe 1517 million in additional income tax and 384 million in accrued interest of which 759 million was paid in april 2018 under a payment arrangement with the ato as of june 30 2020 we have recorded a receivable in prepaid taxes and other noncurrent assets for the amount paid as we ultimately expect this will be refunded by the ato in june 2018 we received a notice from the ato claiming penalties of 50 of the additional income tax that was assessed or 759 million the ato is currently auditing tax years 2014 to 2018 we do not agree with the ato’s assessments and continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position 

net income and earnings per share   as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2020 was 6217 million compared to net income of 4046 million for the year ended june 30 2019 our earnings per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2020 was 427 compared to 280 for the year ended june 30 2019 an increase of 53

we repatriated 4000 million and 3600 million to the united states during both the years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively from earnings generated in each of those years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the united states in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2021 will be determined based on a variety of factors including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the united states such as for the repayment of debt dividend distributions and other domestic obligations 

during the year ended june 30 2018 as a result of the us tax act we treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable which resulted in additional tax expense of 1269 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years therefore future repatriation of cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax if repatriated on june 14 2019 the us treasury department issued final and temporary regulations relating to the repatriation of nonus earnings as a result in the event our nonus earnings had not been permanently reinvested deferred taxes of approximately 1944 million in us federal deferred tax and 52 million in us state deferred taxes would have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

inventories at june 30 2020 were 4169 million an increase of 673 or 19 over the balance at june 30 2019 of 3496 million the increase in inventories was required primarily to support our revenue growth including increased demand for our ventilators due to covid19

during the year ended june 30 2020 we paid 279 million associated with business acquisitions net of cash acquired compared to 9514 million during the year ended june 30 2019

critical accounting principles and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill potentially impaired assets intangible assets income taxes and contingencies 

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

1 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets   we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit as described in step 1 below we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

we conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps 

step 0 or qualitative assessment – evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the factors we consider include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance or eventsspecific to that reporting unit if or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount including goodwill we would move to step 1 of the quantitative method 

  

 45  

  



  

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

step 1 – compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit if a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

2 income tax   we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made alternatively if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results 

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws although currently immaterial we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on our regular assessment we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

in connection with the audit by the ato for the tax years 2009 to 2013 we received notices of amended assessments in march 2018 based on these assessments the ato asserted that we owe 1517 million in additional income tax and 384 million in accrued interest of which 759 million was paid in april 2018 under a payment arrangement with the ato in june 2018 we received a notice from the ato claiming penalties of 50 of the additional income tax that was assessed or 759 million at june 30 2020 we recorded a receivable in prepaid taxes and other noncurrent assets for the amount paid as we ultimately expect this will be refunded by the ato the ato is currently auditing tax years 2014 to 2018 we do not agree with the ato’s assessments and continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position 

3 revenue recognition   we have determined that we have two operating segments which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry “sleep and respiratory care” and the supply of business management software as a service to outofhospital health providers “saas” for products in our sleep and respiratory care business we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms for our saas business revenue associated with professional services are recognized as they are provided we defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our sleep and respiratory care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our saas business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some saas contracts generally deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years our contracts do not contain significant financing components 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services in our sleep and respiratory care business the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives eg rebates discounts free goods and returns offered to customers in accounting for these rebate programs we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer we also recognize discount on products as a reduction to revenue when control is transferred we adjust the estimate of revenue for the impact of returned items at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated the amount expected to be received changes or when the consideration becomes fixed however returns of products excluding warrantyrelated returns are infrequent and insignificant 

when sleep and respiratory care or saas contracts have multiple performance obligations we generally use an observable price to determine the standalone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers revenue is then allocated proportionately based on the determined standalone selling price to each performance obligation an allocation is not required for many of our sleep and respiratory care contracts that have a single performance obligation which is the shipment of our therapybased equipment

general 

﻿ 

we are a global leader in the development manufacturing distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloudbased software solutions that diagnose treat and manage respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing or sdb chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings our cloudbased software digital health applications along with our devices are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers 

﻿ 

following our formation in 1989 we commercialized a treatment for osa this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

﻿ 

since the development of cpap we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products ventilation devices diagnostic products mask systems for use in the hospital and home headgear and other accessories dental devices portable oxygen concentrators or pocs  and cloudbased software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes   our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion our research and product development efforts acquisitions and an increasing awareness of sdb and respiratory conditions like copd as significant health concerns   we are also a leading provider of cloudbased software health applications and devices designed to provide connected care improving patient outcomes and efficiencies for healthcare providers these tools are designed to allow fewer people to manage more patients and empower patients to track their own health outcomes

corporate history 

﻿ 

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries in june 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market in september 1999 we transferred our principal listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol “rmd” in november 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdis on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol “rmd” ten cdis on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

﻿ 

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

﻿ 

since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors suppliers developers of medical equipment and related technologies and software solutions providers 

﻿ 

segment information 

﻿ 

prior to the three months ended december 31 2018 we had previously determined that our softwareasasol utions or saas line of business was not material to our global operations in terms of revenue and profit and therefore had not been separately reported as a segment however following recent acquisitions we have quantitatively and qualitatively reassessed our segment reporting and determined the saas segment is material to the group and now have two operating segments which are the sleep and respiratory care segment and the saas segment see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

the market 

﻿ 

we are focused on the sleep and related respiratory care markets both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated markets and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes create efficiencies for our customers help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs additionally our software solutions are focused outofhospital care market  which we believe is fragmented and underserved and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve outofhospital healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care improving clinical decision support and driving interoperability across outofhospital care settings 

﻿ 

sleep 

﻿ 

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

﻿ 

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

﻿

a longterm epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 46 million people another study published in 201 9 estimated that mild to severe sleep apnea impacts more than 936 million people worldwide of which it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

﻿ 

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population until recently it has typically been diagnosed among middleaged men who are obese however we believe the importance of osa in women is increasingly being recognized with nearly 40 of new pap patients being female a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with chronic heart failure 

﻿ 

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

﻿ 

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

﻿ 

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

﻿ 

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apneal ink air or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

﻿ 

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development 

﻿ 

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid1980s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

﻿

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air devices including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

﻿ 

respiratory care 

﻿ 

our aim is to provide respiratory c are solutions to patients with copd and other chronic respiratory diseases  such as overlap syndrome obesity hypoventilation syndrome or ohs and neuromuscular disease including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als  we aim to improve their quality of life slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management 

﻿ 

our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from cpap or vpap systems at night to those who are dependent on noninvasive or invasive ventilation for lifesupport and those who require portable oxygen concentrators  or pocs  our devices are predominantly used in the home and to a lesser extent in general hospital wards and respiratory wards we supply cpap and vpap systems noninvasive and invasive ventilators humidifiers and accessories including masks and tubing we also offer stationary and portable battery powered oxygen concentrators for the administration of longterm oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients 

﻿ 

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs it is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways symptoms encountered with copd include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production copd includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis   a recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 380 million people worldwide who suffer from copd 

﻿ 

patients with copd can have different clinical presentations patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen hypoxemia and elevated levels of carbon dioxide hypercapnia a chronic productive cough cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity during sleep chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia in general the more hypoxic a copd patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in copd patients and is more pronounced in rem sleep some copd patients may also suffer from comorbid osa a condition known as overlap syndrome 

﻿ 

home noninvasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe copd by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions 

﻿ 

overlap syndrome in patients with overlap syndrome cpap has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange noninvasive ventilation or niv has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of copd through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing it may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilatorassociated pneumonia in patients with stable copd the advantages of home niv are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and healthrelated quality of life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays 

﻿ 

longterm oxygen therapy or ltot is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients the administration of ltot has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia in hypoxemic copd patients ltot is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and also associated with improved healthrelated quality of life measures in longterm copd survivors with a history of congestive heart failure ltot is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression 

﻿ 

obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs is characterized by the combination of obesity chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sdb after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation ohs is frequently associated with osa with an estimated 90 of patients also having osa 

﻿

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

in patients with ohs positive airway therapy both cpap and niv has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive 

﻿ 

neuromuscular disease neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology or indirectly via nerve pathology impair the functioning of muscles symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue dysphagia dyspnoea on exertion and at rest sleepiness morning headache difficulties with concentration and mood changes most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation being wheelchairbound swallowing difficulties respiratory muscle weakness and eventually death from respiratory failure neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly rapidly progressive conditions  such as als and duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years variable or slowly progressive conditions such as myotonic muscular dystrophy are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy 

﻿ 

niv treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases in als patients niv treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures sleeprelated symptoms and survival studies have demonstrated that patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with niv treatment 

﻿ 

business strategy 

﻿ 

we believe that the sdb and respiratory care markets will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa csa and copd improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders improved understanding of the role of noninvasive ventilation in the management of copd and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb and respiratory care markets  as well as growth in outofhospital care setting s  consists of the following key elements

manufacturing 

﻿ 

we operate a globally distributed manufacturing network designed for supply chain resilience and that is intended to control costs and minimize risks our manufacturing operations consist of specialist component production as well as assembly and testing of our devices masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products many are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us any reduction or halt in supply from one of these singlesource suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received we strive for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes to deliver yearonyear improvement in output cost and product quality each manufacturing site and team are responsible for the quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback   

﻿ 

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell our main manufacturing sites are certified to iso 13485 and audited at regular intervals by a notified body additionally our sydney loyang san diego atlanta and moreno valley sites are certified under the medical device single audit program or mdsap an audit of medical device manufacturers’ quality management system to satisfy multiple regulatory requirements mdsap audits are conducted by a mdsap recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of multiple regulatory jurisdictions ie australia brazil canada japan and the united states of america

﻿ 

thirdp arty coverage and reimbursement 

﻿ 

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payors outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors our success in major markets depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our products 

﻿ 

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics who invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia china and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

﻿ 

healthcare reform in the united states   continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape i n 20 11  the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms implemented the competitive bidding program which included home medical equipment or hme  that we manufacture and develop specifically oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years in addition the   2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act or collectively the aca  required cms to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in noncompetitive bidding areas also known as the nonbid or round 3 areas to match competitive bidding prices by 2016 cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and the rates became fully effective july 1 2016   the implementation of the competitive acquisition program has resulted in reduced medicare payment for oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and noncompetitive bidding areas through a n interim final rule issued in may 2018 cms increased the fee schedule amounts for certain dme in nonbid areas that qualify as   rural and noncontiguous  setting payment for these areas for june 1 2018 to december 31 2018   at a 5050 blended reimbursement rate based on the precompetitive bidding reimbursement rate and the adjusted reimbursement rate set through competitive bidding

due to the lapse of competitive bid contracts as of december 31 2018 effective january 1 2019 medicare beneficiaries may receive durable medical equipment from any medicareenrolled supplier until new contracts are in effect under the next round of competitive bidding which is expected to take effect on january 1 2021 pricing in competitive bidding areas and nonrural contiguous nonbid areas will continue to use adjusted fee schedule amounts subject to annual consumer price index cpi adjustments beginning in 2019 until the next bidding round takes place cms also extended the blended fee schedule amounts for nonbid rural and noncontiguous areas through december 31 2020  

﻿ 

in the next round of durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos competitive bidding program expected to take effect on january 1 2021 there have been some revisions to the bidding methodology including the plan to implement surety bond requirements lead item pricing and setting reimbursement rates at the maximum winning bid rate instead of the median winning bid rate in addition cms has expanded the categories of devices subject to competitive bidding to include noninvasive ventilators which have not previously been subject to competitive bidding 

﻿ 

the aca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources also included among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 however this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the us congress for medical device sales during calendar years 2016 through 2019 if this excise tax had not been suspended it would be applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apneal ink air vpap tx and certain respiratory care and dental sleep products absent further congressional action this excise tax will be reinstated for medical device sales beginning january 1 2020 the aca also provided for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services 

﻿ 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact that the aca or any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca as well as recent efforts by the trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the aca and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 includes a provision repealing effective january 1 2019 the taxbased shared responsibility payment imposed by the aca on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” on december 14 2018 a us district court judge in the northern district of texas or texas district court judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the aca and therefore because it was repealed as part of the us tax act the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well while the texas district court judge as well as the trump administration and cms have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect it is unclear how this decision subsequent appeals will impact the aca further the administration and the us congress may take further action regarding the aca including but not limited to repeal or replacement additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge 

﻿ 

service and warranty 

﻿ 

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our devices in some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

﻿ 

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

﻿ 

competition 

﻿ 

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features valueadded solutions reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us our primary competitors include philips bv fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited devilbiss healthcare apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors such as löwenstein medical gmbh  co kg are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them finally our products compete with surgical procedures  nerve stimulation devices and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

﻿ 

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property   

﻿ 

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

﻿ 

we rely on a combination of patents designs trademarks trade   secrets copyrights and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights   some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products we believe the combination of these rights in aggregate are of material importance to each of our businesses through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this report we own or have licensed rights to over 5700 pending allowed or granted patents and designs patents and d esigns have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change   of our patents 259 us patents and 705 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

﻿ 

litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

﻿ 

government regulations 

﻿ 

fda 

﻿ 

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

﻿ 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

﻿

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed pursuant to 510k premarketing clearances and are either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

﻿ 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties the fda recently reviewed its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device and determined that manufacturers should continue adhering to the 1997 guidance on this topic in october 2017 the fda issued guidance that it believes preserves the basic content and format of the 1997 guidance with updates to add clarity   

﻿ 

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

﻿ 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

﻿ 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

﻿ 

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country

eea 

﻿ 

in the european economic area which is comprised of the 28 member states of the european union plus norway iceland and liechtenstein or eea manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the essential requirements laid out in annex i to the eu medical devices directive council directive 9342eec compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the ce mark to medical devices without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the eea to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the ce mark manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i with no measuring function and which are not sterile where the manufacturer can issue an ec declaration of conformity based on a selfassessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an eea country to conduct conformity assessments depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure the notified body would audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of the devices the notified body issues a ce certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements this certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the ce mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related ec declaration of conformity 

﻿ 

as a general rule demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based among other things on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use specifically a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence 

﻿ 

all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the eea must comply with the eu medical device vigilance system under this system incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the member states of the eea and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions or fscas to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market an incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics andor performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which directly or indirectly might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health an fsca may include the recall modification exchange destruction or retrofitting of the device fscas must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers andor to the end users of the device through field safety notices 

﻿ 

where appropriate our products commercialized in europe are ce marked and classified as either class i or class ii 

﻿ 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

﻿ 

the medical devices regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication in may 2020 once applicable the new regulations will among other things

these modifications may have an impact on the way we design and manufacture products and the way we conduct our business in the eea   we are progressing in our plans to meet the new requirements 

﻿ 

other regulatory bodies 

﻿ 

our devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the therapeutic goods administration in australia health canada in canada and cfda in china 

﻿ 

other healthcare laws 

﻿ 

we are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

﻿ 

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act violations of the federal antikickback statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to  100000 for each violation plus up to three times the remuneration involved violations of the federal antikickback statute can also result in criminal penalties including criminal fines of up to 100000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years in addition violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid 

﻿ 

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act when an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil false claims act the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from 11 463 to 22 927 for each false claim plus treble damages and exclude the entity from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs private suits filed under the civil false claims act known as qui tam actions can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government these individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 

﻿ 

the federal civil monetary penalties law prohibits among other things the offering or transfer of remuneration to a medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by medicare or a state healthcare program unless an exception applies 

﻿ 

the federal physician sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs biologicals and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the fda and for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program to report annually to the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms information related to i payments and other transfers of value to physicians  physician assistants nurse practitioners other practitioners and teaching hospitals and ii ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to cms failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of 11 278 per failure up to an aggregate of 16 9170 per year or up to an aggregate of 1 128 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely accurately and completely reported in an annual submission and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

﻿ 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation

﻿ 

also many us states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs 

﻿ 

under hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech which we collectively refer to as hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations  including the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules to protect the privacy and security of protected health information  or phi used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates  hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties of up to 57051 per violation not to exceed 17 million per calendar year for noncompliance of an identical provision  in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well 

﻿ 

in some of our operations such as those involving our cloudbased software digital health applications we are a business associate under hipaa and therefore required to comply with the hipaa security rule breach notification rule and certain provisions of the hipaa privacy rule and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 

﻿ 

in addition as of may 25 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr has replaced the data protection directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the european area or eea  the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including for example higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime shortened timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention and secondary use of information   including for research purposes  increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data and additional obligations when we contract third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr   also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eea including to the united states and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by european regulators under the gdpr as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the european courts european data protection law provides that eea member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase and harm our business and financial condition   the gdpr and other similar regulations impose additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent for electronic marketing such as a prohibition on prechecked tick boxes and bundled consents thereby requiring customers to affirmatively consent for a given purpose through separate tick boxes or other affirmative action failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the eea member states may result in fines of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties   as well as individual claims for compensation  to comply with the new data protection rules imposed by gdpr we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

﻿ 

in addition brexit could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes by the planned exit date of october 2019 it remains unclear how the united kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the united kingdom from the european union will be regulated especially if the united kingdom leaves the european union without a deal however the united kingdom has transposed the gdpr into domestic law with the data protection act 2018 which will remain in force even if and when the united kingdom leaves the eu 

﻿ 

numerous other state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of patient health information in addition congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information with the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach such as prompt disclosure to affected customers generally these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches the federal trade commission or ftc and states’ attorneys general have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair andor deceptive acts or practices under the ftc act in addition to data breach notification laws some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information these laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies we intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities 

﻿ 

the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations

as of june 30 2019  we had approximately 7240 employees or fulltime consultants of which approximately 2930 were employed in cost of sales activities including areas such as warehousing and manufacturing 1200 in research and development and 3110 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 2810 were located in the u nited states  canada and latin america 1430 in australia 1250 in europe and 1750 in asia we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

﻿ 

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

﻿ 

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

﻿ 

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

﻿ 

we have expanded our marketing activities in some markets to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

﻿ 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations many home health care dealers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer 

﻿ 

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer

if we fail to integrate our acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer part of our growth strategy includes acquiring businesses consistent with our commitment to innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb and respiratory care as well as our saas business for example we acquired matrixcare in november 2018 and propeller health in january 2019 the success of our acquisitions including matrixcare will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the business and operations of the acquired companies  additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

﻿ 

we have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions that may prove to be materially inaccurate we have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions including matrixcare such as 









﻿ 

while management has made such assumptions in good faith and believes them to be reasonable the assumptions may turn out to be materially inaccurate including for reasons beyond our control if these assumptions are incorrect we may change or modify our assumptions and such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

﻿ 

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales in combined europe asia and other markets accounted for approximately 35 and 38 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2019 and june 30 2018 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 35 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 



















﻿ 

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the mma under the program our customers who provide home medical equipment must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas in addition under the aca in 2016 cms adjusted the prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and were fully effective july 1 2016 this program has significantly reduced the medicare reimbursement to our customers compared with reimbursement in 2011 at the beginning of the program the 21st century cures act retroactively adjusted rates in nonbid areas to allow for the higher phasein rates to be paid for items furnished between july 1 2016 and december 31 2016 rather than the lower fullyadjusted rates rules issued by cms in 2018 resumed the higher phasein rates in rural and noncontiguous noncompetitive bidding areas for items furnished between june 1 2018 and december 31 2020 on march 7 2019 cms announced it would initiate a new round of competitive bidding named round 2021 with contracts expected to become effective on january 1 2021 and extend through december 31 2023 in addition to adopting new bidding processes cms expanded the product categories included in competitive bidding to include noninvasive ventilators in addition to oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories which had been included in prior rounds of competitive bidding 

﻿ 

we cannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition   if changes are made to this program in the future it could affect amounts being recovered by our customers

healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the aca was signed into law in the united states the aca made changes that significantly impacted the healthcare industry including medical device manufacturers  one of the principal purposes of the aca was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of americans who were uninsured the aca required adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate 

﻿ 

the aca also contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this included new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products through a series of legislative amendments the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019  but is scheduled to return beginning in 2020 absent further congressional action in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the aca also included among other things demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payors for our products and decreased profits to us 

﻿ 

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted these changes included an aggregate reduction in medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

﻿ 

the full impact on our business of the aca and other new laws is uncertain nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted if any or how such changes would affect the demand for our products future actions by the administration and the us congress including but not limited to repeal or replacement of the aca could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge for example on december 14 2018 a us district court judge in the northern district of texas or texas district court judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the aca and therefore because it was repealed as part of the us tax act the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well while the texas district court judge as well as the trump administration and cms have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect it is unclear how this decision subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the aca will impact the aca and our business

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states the aca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations although in the united states we do not provide healthcare services submit claims for thirdparty reimbursement or receive payments directly from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors for our products we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country 

﻿ 

in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry for example from 2016 through 2019 the office of inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services has sent us subpoenas informal requests and a civil investigative demand requesting documents and other materials that relate to our business practices marketing programs promotional activities and leasing programs with home medical equipment providers medical providers sleep labs and physicians responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these types of investigations healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business 

﻿ 

we have tentatively agreed with the government to civilly resolve the 2016 to 20 19 government investigations described above for a payment of 395 million and we expect to also incur additional fees and administrative costs that typically accompany such a resolution as a result we have reserved 412 million for the expenses we expect to incur in connection with this settlement a resolution may also include ongoing obligations  such as any imposed under a corporate integrity agreement however we have not yet completed negotiations and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the parties will finalize any such negotiated resolution or what the final terms of such a resolution will be  

﻿ 

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs   additional compliance and reporting obligations imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our ope rations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results   

﻿ 

our use and disclosure of individually identifiable information including health information is subject to federal state and foreign privacy and security regulations and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm the privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored maintained received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies legal standards for privacy including but not limited to ‘‘unfairness’’ and ‘‘deception’’ as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose audience and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business recently there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacyrelated lawsuits filed against companies concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business 

﻿ 

numerous foreign federal and state laws and regulations govern collection dissemination use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information including i state privacy and confidentiality laws including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches ii hipaa and iii european and other foreign data protection laws including the gdpr 

﻿ 

hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information including what is known as protected health information by health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically or covered entities and their ‘‘business associates’’ which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information certain portions of our business such as the cloudbased software digital health applications are subject to hipaa as a business associate of our covered entities clients to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of phi hipaa requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa as a business associate we are also directly liable for compliance with hipaa penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties 

﻿ 

hipaa authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under hipaa on behalf of state residents courts can award damages costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of hipaa in such cases while hipaa does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for hipaa violations its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of phi 

﻿

hipaa further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” covered entities must notify affected individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” if their unsecured phi is subject to an unauthorized access use or disclosure if a breach affects 500 patients or more covered entities must report it to hhs and local media without unreasonable delay and hhs will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website if a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals the covered entity must log it and notify hhs at least annually 

﻿ 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us our solutions may be perceived as not secure we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients we are liable not only contractually but also directly under hipaa 

﻿ 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in nonus countries covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time 

﻿ 

in addition as of may 25 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr has replaced the data protection directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the economic area or eea the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including for example higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime shortened timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention and secondary use of information including for research purposes  increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data and additional obligations when we contract third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eea including to the united states and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by european regulators under the gdpr as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the european courts european data protection law   provides that eea member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase and harm our business and financial condition the gdpr and other similar regulations impose additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent for electronic marketing such as a prohibition on prechecked tick boxes and bundled consents thereby requiring customers to affirmatively consent for a given purpose through separate tick boxes or other affirmative action failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the eea member states may result in fines of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation  to comply with the new data protection rules imposed by gdpr we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects compliance with such laws and regulations causes our costs to increase and harms our business and financial condition additionally limitations on our ability to use and share personal data could adversely affect our business 

﻿ 

in addition brexit could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes by the planned exit date of october 2019 it remains unclear how the united kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the united kingdom from the european union will be regulated especially if the united kingdom leaves the european union without a deal however the united kingdom has transposed the gdpr into domestic law with the data protection act 2018 which will remain in force even if and when the united kingdom leaves the eu 

﻿ 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business

our business activities are subject to extensive regulation and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore certain of our products could be subject to recall if the food and drug administration or the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that those products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

﻿ 

actual or attempted breaches of security unauthorized disclosure of information denial of service attacks or the perception that personal andor other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure could result in a material loss of business substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation we receive collect process use and store a large amount of information from clients and our own employees including personally identifiable protected health and other sensitive and confidential information this data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks including the internet the secure transmission of such information over the internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems we have implemented security measures technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify detect and prevent unauthorized access alteration use or disclosure of our and our clients’ and employees’ data however there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security beyond external criminal activity systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations 

﻿ 

if someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems they could steal any information located therein or cause interruptions to our operations security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss andor litigation fines and sanctions we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data while we maintain insurance that covers certain security and privacy breaches we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability   

﻿ 

we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security including hipaa and european data privacy laws complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny fines and civil liability in addition any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information additional costs associated with repairing any system damage incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches including organizational changes deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies employee training and engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants furthermore these rules are constantly changing for example as stated above the gdpr has been adopted the euus safe harbor framework has been declared invalid and the euus privacy shield framework has recently been formally adopted by the european commission while the standard contractual clauses are being challenged in the european courts additionally the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 

﻿ 

we cannot assure you that any of our thirdparty service providers with access to our or our clients andor employees’ personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof which could have a corresponding effect on our business

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline unless a product is exempt before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

﻿ 

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process for example in november 2018 fda officials announced forthcoming steps that the fda intends to take to modernize the 510k premarket notification pathway among other things the fda announced that it plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510k pathway toward the use of newer predicates these proposals include plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510k clearance pathway and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old in february 2019 the fda also finalized guidance establishing a “safety and performance based pathway” for “manufacturers of certain wellunderstood device types” allowing manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the fda to demonstrate substantial equivalence obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process some of these proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted and the fda announced that it would seek public feedback prior to publication of any such proposals and may work with congress to implement such proposals through legislation accordingly it is unclear the extent to which any proposals if adopted could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our ability to obtain new 510k clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business 

﻿ 

in addition the fda recently evaluated its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device although the fda had historically proposed a number of changes to a longstanding guidance from 1997 on this topic the fda concluded that manufacturers should continue adhering to the principles in the 1997 guidance in october 2017 the fda issued final guidance superseding the 1997 guidance which fda believes preserves the basic format and content of the 1997 guidance with updates to enhance predictability consistency and transparency of the decisionmaking process the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing stricter requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the united states significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

﻿ 

changes in funding for the fda and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner which could negatively impact our business the ability of the fda to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and statutory regulatory and policy changes in addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable   disruptions at the fda and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs biologics or devices to be reviewed andor cleared or approved by necessary government agencies which would adversely affect our business for example over the last several years including for 35 days beginning on december 22 2018 the us government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the fda have had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities if a prolonged government shutdown occurs it could significantly impact the ability of the fda to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

﻿

our effective income tax rate was affected by the geographic mix of our earnings our singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30 2030 as a result of the us tax act  we treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable during the year ended june 30 2018 therefore future repatriation of cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax if repatriated

critical accounting principles and estimates 

﻿ 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

﻿ 

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

﻿

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

1 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

﻿ 

we conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments our goodwill impairment review involves the following steps 

﻿ 

step 0 or qualitative assessment – evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill the factors we consider include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance or eventsspecific to that reporting unit if or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount including goodwill we would move to step 1 of the quantitative method 

﻿ 

step 1 – compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value we would proceed to step 2 if a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

﻿ 

step 2 – allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and nongoodwill intangible assets and liabilities this will derive an implied fair value for the goodwill then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 

﻿ 

2 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made alternatively if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results 

﻿ 

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws although currently immaterial we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on our regular assessment we may adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

﻿ 

in connection with the audit by the ato for the tax years 2009 to 2013 we received notices of amended assessments in march 2018 based on these assessments the ato asserted that we owe 1517 million in additional income tax and 384 million in accrued interest of which 759 million was paid in april 2018 under a payment arrangement with the ato in june 2018 we received a notice from the ato claiming penalties of 50 of the additional income tax that was assessed or 759 million the ato is currently auditing tax years 2014 to 2017 and we have also been notified by the ato that they intend to audit tax year 2018 we do not agree with the ato’s assessments and continue to believe we are more likely than not to be successful in defending our position

3 revenue recognition we have determined that we have two operating segments which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry “sleep and respiratory care” and the supply of business management software as a service to outofhospital health providers “saas” for products in our sleep and respiratory care business we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms for our saas business revenue associated with professional services are recognized as they are provided we defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our sleep and respiratory care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our saas business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some saas contracts generally deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years 

﻿ 

revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services in our sleep and respiratory care business  the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives eg rebates discounts free goods and returns offered to customers and their customers in accounting for these rebate programs we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer we also recognize discount on products as a reduction to revenue when control is transferred we adjust the estimate of revenue for the impact of returned items at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated the amount expected to be received changes or when the consideration becomes fixed   however returns of products excluding warrantyrelated returns are infrequent and insignificant 

﻿ 

many of our sleep and respiratory care contracts have a single performance obligation which is the shipment of our therapybased equipment however when the sleep and respiratory care or saas contract has multiple performance obligations we generally use an observable price to determine the standalone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers revenue is then allocated proportionately based on the determined standalone selling price to the performance obligation 

﻿ 

we include shipping and handling associated with our sleep and respiratory care business within cost of sales and record shipping and handling costs collected from customers in net revenue taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue

general 

﻿ 

we are a global leader in the development manufacturing distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloudbased software applications that diagnose treat and manage respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing or sdb chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings our cloudbased software digital health applications along with our devices are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers 

﻿ 

following our formation in 1989 we commercialized a treatment for osa this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

﻿ 

since the development of cpap we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products ventilation devices diagnostic products mask systems for use in the hospital and home headgear and other accessories dental devices portable oxygen concentrators or pocs and cloudbased software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion our research and product development efforts acquisitions and an increasing awareness of sdb and respiratory conditions like copd as significant health concerns 

﻿ 

we employ approximately 6000 people and sell our products in approximately 120 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

corporate history 

﻿ 

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries in june 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market in september 1999 we transferred our principal listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol “rmd” in november 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdis on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol “rmd” ten cdis on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

﻿ 

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

﻿ 

since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors suppliers developers of medical equipment and related technologies and software solutions providers 

﻿ 

segment information 

﻿ 

we have determined that we predominantly operate in a single operating segment which is the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry due to the acquisition of brightree llc “brightree” in april 2016 our operations now include the supply of business management software and services to medical equipment and home health providers however these operations both in terms of revenue and profit are not material to our global operations and have not been separately reported see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the n otes to our consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

the market 

﻿ 

we are focused on the sleep and related respiratory care markets both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated markets and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes create efficiencies for our customers help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs 

﻿ 

sleep 

﻿ 

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

﻿ 

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

﻿ 

a longterm epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 46 million people another study published in 2018 estimated that mild to severe sleep apnea impacts more than 936 million people worldwide  of which it was estimated that more than 424 million would have modera te to severe sleep apnea    despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

﻿

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population until recently it has typically been diagnosed among middleaged men who are obese however we believe the importance of osa in women is increasingly being recognized with nearly 40 of new pap patients being female a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with chronic heart failure 

﻿ 

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

﻿ 

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

﻿ 

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

﻿ 

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink air or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

﻿ 

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development 

﻿ 

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid1980s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

﻿ 

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air devices including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night

respiratory care 

﻿ 

our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients with from copd and other chronic respiratory diseases  such as overlap syndrome obesity hypoventilation syndrome or ohs and neuromuscular disease including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als  we aim to improve their quality of life slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management 

﻿ 

our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from cpap or vpap systems at night to those who are dependent on noninvasive or invasive ventilation for lifesupport and those who require portable oxygen concentrators “poc” our devices are predominantly used in the home and to a lesser extent in general hospital wards and respiratory wards we supply cpap and vpap systems noninvasive and invasive ventilators humidifiers and accessories including masks and tubing we also offer stationary and portable battery powered oxygen concentrators for the administration of longterm oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients 

﻿ 

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs it is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways symptoms encountered with copd include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production copd includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis   a recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 380 million people worldwide who suffer from copd 

﻿ 

patients with copd can have different clinical presentations patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen hypoxemia and elevated levels of carbon dioxide hypercapnia a chronic productive cough cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity during sleep chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia in general the more hypoxic a copd patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in copd patients and is more pronounced in rem sleep some copd patients may also suffer from comorbid osa a condition known as overlap syndrome 

﻿ 

home noninvasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe copd by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions 

﻿ 

overlap syndrome in patients with overlap syndrome cpap has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange noninvasive ventilation or niv has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of copd through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing it may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays as well as reducing complicati n g factors such as ventilatorassociated pneumonia in patients with stable copd the advantages of home niv are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and healthrelated quality of life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays 

﻿ 

longterm oxygen therapy or ltot is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients the administration of ltot has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia in hypoxemic copd patients ltot is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and also associated with improved healthrelated quality of life measures in longterm copd survivors with a history of congestive heart failure ltot is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression 

﻿ 

obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs is characterized by the combination of obesity chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sdb after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation ohs is frequently associated with osa with an estimated 90 of patients also having osa 

﻿ 

in patients with ohs positive airway therapy both cpap and niv has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive

neuromuscular disease neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology or indirectly via nerve pathology impair the functioning of muscles symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue dysphagia dyspnoea on exertion and at rest sleepiness morning headache difficulties with concentration and mood changes most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation being wheelchairbound swallowing difficulties respiratory muscle weakness and eventually death from respiratory failure neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly rapidly progressive conditions  such as als and duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years variable or slowly progressive conditions such as myotonic muscular dystrophy are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy 

﻿ 

niv treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases in als patients niv treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures sleeprelated symptoms and survival studies have demonstrated that patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with niv treatment 

﻿ 

business strategy 

﻿ 

we believe that the sdb and respiratory care markets will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa csa and copd improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders improved understanding of the role of noninvasive ventilation in the management of copd and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb and respiratory care markets consists of the following key elements

the second horizon includes the use of connected devices for the treatment of respiratory failure both in the hospital and the home we believe that copd is a large and underpenetrated market where there are unmet patient needs as the global population with copd continues to expand due to smoking and poor air quality some patients with laterstage copd may benefit from the use of ventilation at night but until recently only a small number of copd patients were treated using ventilation on a longterm basis a study published in 2017 found that patients with stable but severe copd using noninvasive ventilation nightly for six months experienced a reduction in mortality and an improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity the findings from this study and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in the size of the homecare market for niv in 2016 we expanded our product portfolio for the treatment of copd with our acquisition of inova labs a company that designs and manufactures pocs many patients in earlier stages of copd may require oxygen therapy and through the use of niv and poc products they can receive this treatment in the home 

﻿ 

our third horizon focuses on a portfolio of new market options including sleep and consumer wellness connected care expansion to continue to drive efficiency within the healthcare ecosystem and clinical areas of interest in adjacent markets like atrial fibrillation heart failure and asthma 

﻿ 

we continue to approach this horizon by building a pipeline of growth options focusing on technology disruption of healthcare that will lead to value creation opportunities we continue working with key opinion leaders in pulmonology cardiology neurology and related clinical areas a growing body of literature documents the association and interactions between a number of cardiac diseases and sdb osa is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is prevalent in hypertensive populations particularly those resistant to therapy treatment with cpap tends to lower blood pressure osa is prevalent in those with atrial fibrillation and may trigger episodes of fibrillation treatment with cpap appears to improve outcomes osa is also known to be a strong risk factor for the development of acute coronary disease and cardiovascular disease in general heart failure is also commonly associated with both osa and csa and both forms of sdb are risk factors for poor outcomes we are undertaking several clinical trials in cardiology to strengthen the knowledge base on the effects of sdb therapy on outcomes in addition to clinical trials we pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients 

﻿ 

we are also working with occupational health professionals to raise awareness of the issues caused by untreated osa in the workplace including accidents absenteeism and reduced productivity plus increased costs for employers who provide healthcare coverage for employees 

﻿ 

we continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets 

﻿

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

﻿ 

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payors outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors our success in major markets depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our products 

﻿ 

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics who invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia china and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

﻿ 

the past decade of legislative reform in the united states including by way of example the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the aca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 deficit reduction act of 2005 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or the mma and the 21st century cures act has significantly impacted government reimbursement for products that we provide the longer term impact though not entirely predictable continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape 

﻿ 

beginning in 2005 the mma established a medicare competitive acquisition program for home medical equipment or hme and imposed quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms implemented the competitive bidding program beginning in 2011 and included hme that we manufacture and develop specifically oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years in addition the aca required cms to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in noncompetitive bidding areas also known as the nonbid or round 3 areas to match competitive bidding prices by 2016 cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and the rates became fully effective july 1 2016   as a result of the national rollout medicare payment for cpap devices in noncompetitive bidding areas was reduced by approximately 60 in urban areas and approximately 56 in rural areas as compared to the medicare payment rates that were effective in 2015 the implementation of the competitive acquisition program has resulted in reduced medicare payment for oxygen cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and noncompetitive bidding areas 

﻿ 

on december 13 2016 the 21st century cures act was signed into law which retroactively adjusted rates in nonbid areas to allow for higher phasein rates to be paid for items furnished between july 1 2016 and december 31 2016 rather than the lower fullyadjusted rates an interim final rule was recently issued by cms resuming the higher phasein rates in rural and noncontiguous noncompetitive bidding areas for items furnished between june 1 2018 and december 31 2018   a proposed rule released by medicare on july 11 2018 would  if finalized suspend the competitive bidding program for 2019 and possibly 2020 as they finalize a new auction methodology using clearing price and lead item pricing they propose holding reimbursements steady in the interim including continuing the higher blended phasein rates established in the interim rule 

﻿ 

the aca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources also included among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 however this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the us congress for medical device sales during calendar years 2016 and 2019 if this excise tax had not been suspended it would be applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink air vpap tx and certain respiratory care and dental sleep products absent further congressional action this excise tax will be reinstated for medical device sales beginning january 1 2020 the aca also provided for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services

we cannot predict at this time the full impact that the aca or any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the aca as well as recent efforts by the trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the aca and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 includes a provision repealing effective january 1 2019 the taxbased shared responsibility payment imposed by the aca on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” the administration and the us congress may take further action regarding the aca including but not limited to repeal or replacement additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge 

﻿ 

service and warranty 

﻿ 

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our devices warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

﻿ 

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

﻿ 

competition 

﻿ 

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features valueadded solutions reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

﻿ 

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us our primary competitors include philips bv fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited devilbiss healthcare apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors such as löwenstein medical gmbh  co kg are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them finally our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

﻿ 

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

﻿ 

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

﻿ 

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

﻿ 

through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this report we own or have licensed rights to approximately 1166 issued us patents including approximately 437 design patents and approximately 2123 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 454 pending us patent applications including approximately 34 design patent applications approximately 910 pending foreign patent applications approximately 995 registered foreign designs and 37 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

﻿ 

of our patents 213 us patents and 512 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years there are 50 foreign patents due to expire in 2019 128 in 2020 78 in 2021 117 in 2022 and 139 in 2023 there are 16 us patents due to expire in 2019 74 us patents due to expire in 2020 35 us patents   due to expire in 2021 49 us patents   due to expire in 2022 and 39 us patents   due to expire in 2023 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position

litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

﻿ 

government regulations 

﻿ 

fda 

﻿ 

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

﻿ 

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

﻿ 

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed pursuant to 510k premarketing clearances and are either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

﻿ 

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties the fda recently reviewed its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device and determined that manufacturers should continue adhering to the 1997 guidance on this topic in october 2017  the fda issued guidance that it believes preserves the basic content and format of the 1997 guidance with updates to add clarity

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

﻿ 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

﻿ 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

﻿ 

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 

﻿ 

eea 

﻿ 

in the european economic area which is comprised of the 28 member states of the european union plus norway iceland and liechtenstein or eea manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the essential requirements laid out in annex i to the eu medical devices directive council directive 9342eec compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the ce mark to medical devices without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the eea to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the ce mark manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification except for lowrisk medical devices class i with no measuring function and which are not sterile where the manufacturer can issue an ec declaration of conformity based on a selfassessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an eea country to conduct conformity assessments depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure the notified body would audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture design and final inspection of the devices the notified body issues a ce certificate of conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements this certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the ce mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related ec declaration of conformity 

﻿ 

as a general rule demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based among other things on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use specifically a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence 

﻿ 

all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the eea must comply with the eu medical device vigilance system under this system incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the member states of the eea and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions or fscas to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market an incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics andor performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which directly or indirectly might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health an fsca may include the recall modification exchange destruction or retrofitting of the device fscas must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers andor to the end users of the device through field safety notices

where appropriate our products commercialized in europe are ce marked and classified as either class i or class ii 

﻿ 

on april 5 2017 the european parliament passed the medical devices regulation which repeals and replaces the eu medical devices directive unlike directives which must be implemented into the national laws of the eea member states the regulations would be directly applicable ie without the need for adoption of eea member state laws implementing them in all eea member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among eea member states the medical devices regulation among other things is intended to establish a uniform transparent predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the eea for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation 

﻿ 

the medical devices regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication in may 2020 once applicable the new regulations will among other things 











﻿ 

these modifications may have an impact on the way we design and manufacture products and the way we conduct our business in the eea we are progressing in our plans to meet the new requirements 

﻿ 

other regulatory bodies 

﻿ 

our devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the therapeutic goods administration in australia health canada in canada and cfda in china 

﻿ 

other healthcare laws 

﻿ 

w e are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

﻿ 

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act violations of the federal antikickback statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to 74792 for each violation plus up to three times the remuneration involved violations of the federal antikickback statute can also result in criminal penalties including criminal fines of up to 100000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years in addition violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid 

﻿ 

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act when an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil false claims act the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from 11181 to 22363 for each false claim plus treble damages and exclude the entity from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs   private suits filed under the civil false claims act known as qui tam actions can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government these individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement

the federal civil monetary penalties law prohibits among other things the offering or transfer of remuneration to a medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by medicare or a state healthcare program unless an exception applies 

﻿ 

the federal physician sunshine act which requires certain manufacturers of drugs biologicals and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the fda and for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program to report annually to the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms information related to i payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ii ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to cms failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of 11052 per failure up to an aggregate of 165786 per year or up to an aggregate of 1105 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely accurately and completely reported in an annual submission and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

﻿ 

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation 

﻿ 

also many us states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs 

﻿ 

under hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech which we collectively refer to as hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations  including the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules to protect the privacy and security of protected health information  or phi used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates  hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well  further failure to comply with the hipaa privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to 55910 per violation not to exceed 168 million per calendar year for noncompliance of an identical provision and in certain circumstances criminal penalties with fines up to 250000 andor imprisonment  which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

﻿ 

in some of our operations such as those involving our cloudbased software digital health applications we are a business associate under hipaa and therefore required to comply with the hipaa security rule breach notification rule and certain provisions of the hipaa privacy rule and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 

﻿ 

in addition as of may 25 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr has replaced the data protection directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the european union the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including for example higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime shortened timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention and secondary use of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data and additional obligations when we contract third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr provides that eu member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase and harm our business and financial condition failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties to comply with the new data protection rules imposed by gdpr we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

european data protection law also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu including to the united states these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices in addition these rules are constantly under scrutiny for example following a decision of the court of justice of the european union in october 2015 transferring personal data to us companies that had certified as members of the us safe harbor scheme was declared invalid in july 2016 the european commission adopted the useu privacy shield framework which replaces the safe harbor scheme however this framework is under review and there is currently litigation challenging other eu mechanisms for adequate data transfers ie the standard contractual clauses it is uncertain whether the privacy shield framework andor the standard contractual clauses will be similarly invalidated by the european courts we rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our eu business to the us and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by european regulators under the gdpr as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the european courts 

﻿ 

numerous other state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of patient health information in addition congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information with the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach such as prompt disclosure to affected customers generally these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches the federal trade commission or ftc and states’ attorneys general have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair andor deceptive acts or practices under the ftc act in addition to data breach notification laws some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information these laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies we intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information 

﻿ 

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities 

﻿ 

the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

﻿ 

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

﻿ 

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

﻿ 

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

﻿ 

we have expanded our marketing activities in some markets to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

﻿ 

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations many home health care dealers are consolidating  which may result in greater concentration of market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer 

﻿ 

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer

if we fail to integrate our acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer   part of our growth strategy includes acquiring businesses consistent with our commitment to innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb and respiratory care as well as our saas business the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the business and operations of the acquired companies  additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

﻿ 

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales in combined europe asia and other markets accounted for approximately 38 and 37 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2018 and june 30 2017 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 35 to 40 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 



















﻿ 

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus  sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

﻿ 

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the mma under the program our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas in addition under the aca in 2016 cms adjusted the prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and were fully effective july 1 2016 this program has significantly reduced the medicare reimbursement to our customers compared with reimbursement in 2011 at the beginning of the program similarly provisions of the 21st century cures act were signed into law which retroactively adjusted rates in nonbid areas to allow for the higher phasein rates to be paid for items furnished between july 1 2016 and december 31 2016 rather than the lower fullyadjusted rates an interim final rule was recently issued by cms resuming the higher phasein rates in rural and noncontiguous noncompetitive bidding areas for items furnished between june 1 2018 and december 31 2018 if changes are made to this law in the future it could affect amounts being recovered by our customers

healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the aca was signed into law in the united states the aca made changes that significantly impacted the healthcare industry including medical device manufacturers  one of the principal purposes of the aca was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of americans who were uninsured the aca required adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate 

﻿ 

the aca also contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this included new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products   through a series of legislative amendments the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019  but is scheduled to return beginning in 2020 absent further congressional action in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the aca also included among other things demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payo rs for our products and decreased profits to us 

﻿ 

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted these changes included an aggregate reduction in medicare payments to providers of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and will remain in effect through 202 7 unless additional congressional action is taken on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

﻿ 

the full impact on our business of the aca and other new laws is uncertain nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted if any or how such changes would affect the demand for our products future actions by the administration and the us congress including but not limited to repeal or replacement of the aca could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition additionally all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge 

﻿ 

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states the aca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations although we do not provide healthcare services submit claims for thirdparty reimbursement or receive payments directly from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors for our products we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country

in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to 













﻿ 

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry for example in july 2016 we received a federal administrative subpoena from the office of inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services the subpoena contains a request for documents and other materials that relate primarily to industry offerings of patient resupply software to home medical equipment providers in november 2016 we received a second subpoena requesting documents and other materials regarding discounted sales and leasing to sleep labs samples and other promotional programs in august 2018 we received a third subpoena requesting documents and other materials relating to diagnostic devices and masks provided to medical providers and diagnostic autoscoring functions in addition the government has informally requested information about our leasing arrangements with customers  we are cooperating with the government’s subpoenas and request s for documents and information responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these investigations healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our ope rations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

﻿ 

our use and disclosure of individually identifiable information including health information is subject to federal state and foreign privacy and security regulations and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm the privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored maintained received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies legal standards for privacy including but not limited to ‘‘unfairness’’ and ‘‘deception’’ as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose audience and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business recently there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacyrelated lawsuits filed against companies concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business 

﻿ 

numerous foreign federal and state laws and regulations govern collection dissemination use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information including i state privacy and confidentiality laws including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches ii hipaa and iii european and other foreign data protection laws  including the gdpr  

﻿ 

hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information including what is known as protected health information by health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically or covered entities and their ‘‘business associates’’ which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information certain portions of our business such as the cloudbased software digital health applications are subject to hipaa as a business associate of our covered entities clients to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of phi hipaa requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa as a business associate we are also directly liable for compliance with hipaa penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties 

﻿ 

hipaa authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under hipaa on behalf of state residents courts can award damages costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of hipaa in such cases while hipaa does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for hipaa violations its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of phi 

﻿ 

hipaa further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” covered entities must notify affected individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” if their unsecured phi is subject to an unauthorized access use or disclosure if a breach affects 500 patients or more covered entities must report it to hhs and local media without unreasonable delay and hhs will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website if a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals the covered entity must log it and notify hhs at least annually 

﻿ 

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us our solutions may be perceived as not secure we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients we are liable not only contractually but also directly under hipaa 

﻿ 

we are also subject to laws and regulations in nonus countries covering data privacy and the protection of healthrelated and other personal information eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use storage disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual such as names contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations and have generally become more stringent over time

in addition as of may 25 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr has replaced the data protection directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the european union the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data including for example higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime shortened timelines for data breach notifications limitations on retention and secondary use of information increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised ie keycoded data and additional obligations when we contract third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr provides that eu member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic biometric or health data which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase and harm our business and financial condition failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20000000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties to comply with the new data protection rules imposed by gdpr we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects compliance with such laws and regulations causes our costs to increase and harms our business and financial condition additionally limitations on our ability to use and share personal data could adversely affect our business 

﻿ 

we are also subject to evolving eu laws on data export as we may transfer personal data from the eu to other jurisdictions these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices in addition these rules are constantly under scrutiny for example following a decision of the court of justice of the european union in october 2015 transferring personal data to us companies that had certified as members of the us safe harbor scheme was declared invalid in july 2016 the european commission adopted the useu privacy shield framework which replaces the safe harbor scheme however this framework is under review and there is currently litigation challenging other eu mechanisms for adequate data transfers ie the standard contractual clauses it is uncertain whether the privacy shield framework andor the standard contractual clauses will be similarly invalidated by the european courts we rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our eu business to the us and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by european regulators under the gdpr as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the european courts 

﻿ 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws policies legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations fines and penalties litigation andor adverse publicity including by consumer advocacy groups and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws contractual obligations or suffer a security breach such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations andor could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business 

﻿ 

our business activities are subject to extensive regulation and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the food and drug administration or the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

﻿ 

actual or attempted breaches of security unauthorized disclosure of information denial of service attacks or the perception that personal andor other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure could result in a material loss of business substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation we receive collect process use and store a large amount of information from clients and our own employees including personally identifiable protected health and other sensitive and confidential information this data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks including the internet the secure transmission of such information over the internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems we have implemented security measures technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify detect and prevent unauthorized access alteration use or disclosure of our and our clients’ and employees’ data however there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security beyond external criminal activity systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations

if someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems they could steal any information located therein or cause interruptions to our operations security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss andor litigation fines and sanctions we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data while we maintain insurance that covers certain security and privacy breaches we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability   

﻿ 

we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security including hipaa and european data privacy laws complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny fines and civil liability in addition any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information additional costs associated with repairing any system damage incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches including organizational changes deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies employee training and engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants furthermore these rules are constantly changing for example as stated above the gdpr has been adopted the euus safe harbor framework has been declared invalid and the euus privacy shield framework has recently been formally adopted by the european commission while the standard contractual clauses are being challenged in the european courts  additionally the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 

﻿ 

we cannot assure you that any of our thirdparty service providers with access to our or our clients andor employees’ personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof which could have a corresponding effect on our business 

﻿ 

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline unless a product is exempt before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

﻿ 

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process 

  

for example the fda recently evaluated its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device although the fda had proposed a number of changes to a longstanding guidance from 1997 on this topic the fda concluded that manufacturers should continue adhering to the principles in the 1997 guidance in august 2016 the fda issued a new draft guidance which fda believes preserves the basic format and content of the 1997 guidance with updates to add clarity the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales

laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities our business activities include contacts with consumers in different parts of the world certain laws such as the us telephone consumer protection act regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts with consumers such as phone calls texts or emails our use of outbound contacts may be restricted by existing laws or by laws regulations or regulatory decisions that may be adopted in the future if we are found to have violated these laws or regulations we may be subjected to substantial fines penalties or liabilities to consumers

our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a part of the regulatory process to obtain marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products or for other reasons we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints we our competitors or other third parties may also conduct clinical trials involving our commercially marketed products the results of clinical trials may be unfavorable or inconsistent with previous findings or could identify safety signals associated with our products for example in may 2015 we announced the preliminary analysis of the data from the servehf clinical trial which was designed to assess whether the treatment of moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea with adaptive servoventilation or asv therapy could reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure the preliminary headline results showed no significant difference with respect to allcause mortality and hospitalization however the analysis of the data identified a statistically significant 25 absolute increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for those patients in the trial who received asv therapy with moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea and symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction we worked with global regulatory authorities to revise the labels and instructions for use for resmed asv devices as well as informing healthcare providers physicians and patients of the cardiovascular safety signal observed in servehf current or future clinical trials may not meet primary endpoints may reveal disadvantages of our products and solutions for various markets we address or could generate unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data clinical data or the market’s or regulatory bodies’ perception of the clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product clearances or approvals and our position in and share of the markets in which we participate moreover if these clinical trials identify serious safety issues associated with our marketed products potentially adverse consequences could result including that regulatory authorities could withdraw clearances or approvals of our products we could be required to halt the marketing and sales of our products or recall our products we could be required to update our product labeling with additional warnings we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our reputation may suffer any of these could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

﻿ 

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fdacleared products in particular clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed on proprietary rights of others for example we are involved in litigation with fisher  paykel healthcare which has sued us in the us district court for the southern district of california for allegedly infringing various of their patents related cases are now pending in new zealand germany and australia  if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits

tax laws regulations and enforcement practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and aggressive positions taken by tax authorities

our effective income tax rate was affected by the geographic mix of our earnings our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30 2030 during the year ended june 30 2018 as a result of the   us tax act  we treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable which resulted in additional tax expense of 1269 million therefore future repatriation of cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal income tax if repatriated we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the us and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities supplemented with longterm debt and shortterm borrowings accordingly we intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the us in our foreign operations

liquidity and capital resources 

﻿ 

as of june 30 2018 and june 30 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1887 million and 8219 million respectively working capital was  06 billion and 13 billion at june 30 2018 and june 30 2017  respectively th e reduction in working capital wa s mainly due to net debt repayment of 7962 million during the year ending june 30 2018 as of june 30 2018 we had 03 billion of borrowings under our credit facility agreement as compared to 11 billion at june 30 2017  

﻿ 

as of june 30 2018 and june 30 2017  our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to 369 million and 232 million respectively our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30 2018 and june 30 2017  of 1518 million and 7987 million respectively were held by our nonus subsidiaries our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions 

﻿ 

we repatriated  1 4   b illion and 215 million to the u nited states in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively from earnings generated in each of those years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the u nited states in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2019 will be determined based on a variety of factors including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the u nited states  such as for the repayment of debt dividend distributions and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries’ earnings to the u nited states  has historically occurred at yearend although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs as we did during the year ended june 30 2018 

﻿ 

during the year ended june 30 2018 as a result of the us tax act  we have treated all nonus historical earnings as taxable which resulted in additional tax expense of 1 26  9 million which is payable over the next eight years therefore future repatriation of cash held by our nonus subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax if repatriated as we evaluate the impact of the us tax act and the future cash needs of our global operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested outside the united states   

﻿ 

inventories at june 30 2018   were   2687 million which is consistent with the balance at june 30 2017 of 2683 million

﻿ 

during the year ended june 30 2018  we generated cash of 5050 million from operations this was higher than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30 2017 of 4141 million which was primarily due to the increase in underlying net income when excluding the additional income tax expense of 1380 million relating to the enactment of the us tax act  this additional income tax expense is payable over of the next eight years and therefore is not expected to materially impact our operating cash flows movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30 2018 had the effect of decreasing our cash and cash equivalents by 97 million as reported in us dollars 

﻿ 

during fiscal year 2018  we repurchased 550000 shares at a cost of 538 million and during fiscal year 2017 we did not purchase any shares under our share repurchase program  during fiscal years 2018 and 2017  we also paid dividends totaling 1995 million and 1863 million respectively

critical accounting principles and estimates 

﻿ 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

﻿ 

we state th ese accounting policies in the n otes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

﻿ 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

﻿ 

 1  valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

﻿ 

we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of 2018 using a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessments our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows our goodwill impairment review involved the following steps 

﻿ 

step 0 or qualitative assessment – evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill factors considered included but were not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance or eventsspecific to that reporting unit if or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount including goodwill we would move to step 1 of the quantitative method 

﻿

resmed inc and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

step 1 – compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill for each reporting unit where the carrying value including goodwill exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value move on to step 2 if a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 

﻿ 

step 2 – allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and nongoodwill intangible assets and liabilities this will derive an implied fair value for the goodwill then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 

﻿ 

the results of our review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

﻿ 

2  income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made alternatively if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results 

﻿ 

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws although currently immaterial we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on our regular assessment we may adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

﻿ 

in connection with the audit by the ato” for the tax years 2009 to 2013 we received notices of amended assessments for the tax years 2009 to 2013 based on these assessments the ato is asserting that we owe 1517 million in additional income tax and 384 million in accrued interest of which 759 million was paid in april 2018 under a payment arrangement with the ato   at june 30 2018 we have recorded a receivable in prepaid taxes and other noncurrent assets for the amount paid as we ultimately expect this will be refunded by the ato in june 2018 we received a notice from the ato claiming penalties of 50 of the additional income tax that was assessed or 759 million we do not agree with the ato’s assessments and we continue to believe we are more likely than not to be succes sful in defending our position   we have also been notified by the ato that they intend to audit tax years 2014 to 2017 

﻿ 

 3  revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment which is when title transfers to the customer we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue 

﻿ 

we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders onetime special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations for multipleelement arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendorspecific objective evidence 

﻿ 

we also generate revenue from timebased licensing of our software and associated services in most instances revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprising subscription fees and professional services which typically have contract terms of one to three years we evaluate each element in these multipleelement arrangements to determine whether they represent a separate unit of accounting and recognize each element as the services are performed

general 

  

we are a global leader in the development manufacturing distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloudbased software applications that diagnose treat and manage respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing or sdb chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings our cloudbased software digital health applications along with our devices are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers 

  

following our formation in 1989 we commercialized a treatment for osa this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including 

  

 1  

technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products ventilation devices diagnostic products mask systems for use in the hospital and home headgear and other accessories dental devices portable oxygen concentrators or pocs and cloudbased software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion our research and product development efforts acquisitions and an increasing awareness of sdb and respiratory conditions like copd as significant health concerns 

  

we employ approximately 5250 people and sell our products in approximately 100 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors 

  

our web site address is wwwresmedcom we make our periodic reports together with any amendments available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the securities and exchange commission or sec information contained on the website is not part of or incorporated into this annual report 

  

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries in june 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market in september 1999 we transferred our principal listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd in november 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdis on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdis on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors suppliers developers of medical equipment and related technologies and software solutions providers 

  

segment information 

  

we have determined that we predominantly operate in a single operating segment which is the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry due to the acquisition of brightree llc in april 2016 our operations now include the supply of business management software and services to medical equipment and home health providers however these operations both in terms of revenue and profit are not material to our global operations and therefore have not been separately reported see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

we are focused on underpenetrated markets in the sleep and related respiratory care market where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes create efficiencies for our customers help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs

sleep 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

a longterm epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 46 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with congestive heart failure 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

 3  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development 

  

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airdevice that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air devices including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

respiratory care 

  

our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients suffering from copd and other chronic respiratory diseases such as overlap syndrome obesity hypoventilation syndrome or ohs and neuromuscular disease including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als we aim to improve their quality of life and slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management 

  

 4  

our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from cpap or vpap systems at night through to those who are dependent on noninvasive or invasive ventilation for lifesupport and those who require longterm oxygen therapy our devices are used in the home general hospital wards respiratory wards and the acute and intensive care setting we supply cpap and vpap systems noninvasive and invasive ventilators humidifiers and accessories including masks and tubing in addition we supply specific support solutions for noninvasive and invasive ventilation including mouth piece ventilation secretion clearance assistance and battery backup we also offer stationary and portable battery powered oxygen concentrators for the administration of longterm oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients 

  

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  copd encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs it is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways to noxious gases or particles symptoms encountered with copd include shortness of breath on exertion as well as chronic cough and sputum production copd includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis it is estimated that up to 10 of adults of at least 40 years of age worldwide suffer from copd 

  

patients with copd can have different clinical presentations patients with chronic bronchitis present with hypoxemia and hypercapnia a chronic productive cough cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity during sleep chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia in general the more hypoxic a copd patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in copd patients and is more pronounced in rem sleep some copd patients may also suffer from comorbid osa a condition known as overlap syndrome 

  

overlap syndrome  in patients with overlap syndrome cpap has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange noninvasive ventilation or niv has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of copd through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing it may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays as well as reducing and complication rates of factors such as ventilatorassociated pneumonia in patients with stable copd the advantages of home niv are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnoea scores and healthrelated quality of life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays 

  

longterm oxygen therapy or ltot is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients the administration of ltot has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia in hypoxemic copd patients ltot is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and improved healthrelated quality of life measures in longterm copd survivors with a history of congestive heart failure ltot is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression 

  

obesity hypoventilation syndrome ohs is characterized by the combination of obesity chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and sdb after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation ohs is frequently associated with osa with an estimated 90 of patients also having osa 

  

in patients with ohs positive airway therapy both cpap and niv has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive 

  

 5  

neuromuscular disease  neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly via intrinsic muscle pathology or indirectly via nerve pathology impair the functioning of muscles symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue dysphagia dyspnoea on exertion and at rest sleepiness morning headache difficulties with concentration and mood changes most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation being wheelchairbound swallowing difficulties respiratory muscle weakness and eventually death from respiratory failure neuromuscular disorders can be progress rapidly or slowly rapidly progressive conditions such as als and duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years variable or slowly progressive conditions such as myotonic muscular dystrophy are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy 

  

niv treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases in als patients niv treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures sleeprelated symptoms and survival studies have demonstrated that patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and survival with niv treatment 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb and respiratory care markets will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa and copd improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb and respiratory care markets consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation  we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sdb more effectively increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 2013 we introduced new products across both our mask and device categories including the vpap copd quattro air swift fx bella swift fx nano and resmed’s sleepseeker in 2014 we introduced the airfit™ p10 nasal pillows system airfit™ n10 nasal mask airfit™ f10 fullface mask and the astral™ platform our new generation of life support ventilators during fiscal year 2015 we released significant new products across our device categories including the airsense tm 10 aircurve tm 10 and lumis in 2015 we also released the airview tm  our cloudbased remote monitoring and therapy management system along with our air solutions platform that provides a suite of endtoend healthcare informatics solutions that address customer business processes from diagnosis to monitoring and patient management and billing in 2016 we introduced a number of new software solutions including our resmed resupply goscripts and new features and enhancements within our cloudbased software offerings through our acquisition of brightree we also acquired a suite of softwareasaservice solutions for us based distributor and home health and hospice customers in addition through our acquisitions of inova labs and curative medical we acquired the inova labs range of pocs and a portfolio of curative medical sdb and ventilation products we believe that the combination of continued product development product and technology acquisitions and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 13 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2016 we invested 1187 million or approximately 6 of our net revenues in research and development 

  

 6  

expand geographic presence  we market our products in more than 100 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers patients and thirdparty payors we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other highgrowth geographic regions in 2016 we acquired curative medical to invest in the china market and expand our growth potential in sdb copd and respiratory care in china 

  

respiratory care we are committed to ongoing innovation of our respiratory care products that serve the needs of patients with neuromuscular diseases and a growing global copd patient population with the addition of inova labs pocs and our noninvasive ventilator devices and masks and accessories we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings in this area 

  

increase public and clinical awareness  we continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb copd and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target both the population predisposed to sdb and medical specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation which should further increase awareness of the relationship between sdb or osa copd neuromuscular disease and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry we have helped establish a center for clinical care and medical research at the university of california at san diego in the fields of sleep apnea and copd as well as the establishment of two perpetual academic chairs at the university of sydney called the resmed chair of sleep medicine for sleepdisordered breathing with a focus on chronic disease and the resmed chair of biomedical engineering with an emphasis on bioinformatics research 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2014 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular diseases 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the fields of sdb respiratory care and healthcare informatics in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and solutions and to increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb and the use of inhome life support ventilation to treat copd

we also market our products directly to physicians and sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the device pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 61 57 and 54 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria czech republic denmark finland france germany ireland netherlands norway poland sweden switzerland and the united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers or hospitals who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from thirdparty payors 

  

sales in europe accounted for 29 32 and 36 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have whollyowned subsidiaries in australia china india japan korea new zealand and taiwan we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific in australia and new zealand we operate a home healthcare business and sell our products and services directly to patients sales in asia pacific accounted for 10 11 and 10 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

market growth opportunities 

  

we view the future of our business in sleep and respiratory disorders as having three horizons of growth supported by three key foundations 

  

our three key foundations reach across all three of our horizons and include our focus on operating excellence and high efficiency to leverages our global scale second our global leadership in digital 

  

 13  

health and connected care an important advance in our product and solution offerings and third our expansion into high growth geographic areas including china india eastern europe brazil and southeast asia 

  

the first horizon includes our existing market in osa treatment where we believe our leadership in digital health and connected care is becoming an important distinguishing factor from our competitors the use of technologies that allow remote collection and transfer of information through cloudbased computing is changing the current clinical pathways for following up with patients who use our devices which we believe provides an opportunity to improve patient care and create efficiencies for customers and providers we plan to continue to invest and expand our capabilities in this area 

  

the second horizon includes the use of connected devices for the treatment of respiratory failure both in the hospital and the home we believe that copd is a large and underpenetrated market where there are unmet patient needs as the global population with copd continues to expand due to smoking and poor air quality some patients with laterstage copd may benefit from the use of ventilation at night but until recently only a small number of copd patients were treated using ventilation on a longterm basis a study published in 2014 found that patients with stable but severe copd using noninvasive ventilation nightly for six months experienced a reduction in mortality and an improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity the findings from this study and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in the size of the homecare market for niv additionally the use of niv is becoming routine in many acute care hospitals as guidelines stipulate its use in acute exacerbations and familiarity with the techniques involved increases in 2016 we expanded our product portfolio for the treatment of copd with our acquisition of inova labs a company that designs and manufactures pocs many patients in earlier stages of copd may require oxygen therapy and through the use of niv and poc products they can receive this treatment in the home 

  

our third horizon focuses on a portfolio of new market options including chronic disease management sleep and consumer wellness and clinical areas of interest in adjacent markets like atrial fibrillation heart failure and asthma 

  

we continue to approach this horizon by emphasizing relationships with key opinion leaders in pulmonology cardiology neurology and related clinical areas a growing body of literature documents the association and interactions between a number of cardiac diseases and sdb osa is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is prevalent in hypertensive populations particularly those resistant to therapy treatment with cpap tends to lower blood pressure osa is prevalent in those with atrial fibrillation and may trigger episodes of fibrillation treatment with cpap appears to improve outcomes osa is also known to be a strong risk factor for the development of acute coronary disease and cardiovascular disease in general heart failure is also commonly associated with both osa and csa and both forms of sdb are risk factors for poor outcomes we are undertaking several clinical trials in cardiology to strengthen the knowledge base on the effects of sdb therapy on outcomes in addition to clinical trials we pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients 

  

we are also working with occupational health professionals to raise awareness of the issues caused by untreated osa in the workplace including accidents absenteeism and reduced productivity plus increased costs for employers who provide healthcare coverage for employees 

  

we continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our devices masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us any reduction or halt in supply from one of these singlesource suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell our main manufacturing sites are certified to iso 13485 these sites are subject to thirdparty audits conducted by the iso notified bodies at regular intervals

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payors outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics who invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors 

  

 15  

include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

the past decade of legislative reform in the united states including by way of example the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma has significantly impacted government reimbursement for products that we provide the longer term impact though not entirely predictable continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape 

  

beginning in 2005 the mma established a medicare competitive acquisition program for home medical equipment hme and imposed quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers effective 2011 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms implemented round 1 of competitive bidding in 9 competitive bidding areas or cbas and included home medical equipment that we manufacture and develop specifically cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories the average reduction from the then current medicare payment rates in round 1 of competitive bidding implemented was approximately 32 overall and 34 for cpap and respiratory devices cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years since then there has been one recompete completed for round 1 with rates that went into effect on january 1 2014 in 2013 cms announced the single payment amounts for round 2 which covered a total of 91 cbas effective july 1 2013 the average reduction from the thencurrent medicare payment rates in round 2 was approximately 47 on a weighted average basis for cpap and respiratory devices in 2016 cms implemented the round 2 recompete which covered a total of 117 cbas and announced the single payment amounts effective july 1 2016 in addition the aca required cms to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in noncompetitive bidding areas also known as the round 3 areas to match competitive bidding prices by 2016 cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and were fully effective july 1 2016 

  

the aca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources also included among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 however this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the us congress for medical device sales during calendar years 2016 and 2017 if this excise tax had not been suspended it would be applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products absent further congressional action this excise tax will be reinstated for medical device sales beginning january 1 2018 the aca also provided for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services 

  

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the aca or any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our devices warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features valueadded solutions reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us our primary competitors include philips bv fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited devilbiss healthcare apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors such as weinmann geräte für medizin gmbh  co kg are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them finally our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this annual report we own or have licensed rights to approximately 1043 issued united states patents including approximately 413 design patents and approximately 2020 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 470 pending united states patent applications including approximately 44 design patent applications approximately 952 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1143 registered foreign designs and 54 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 193 united states patents and 427 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years there are 25 united states patents due to expire in 2017 54 united states patents in 2018 16 united states patents in 2019 71 united states patents in 2020 and 27 united states patents in 2021 there are 35 foreign patents due to expire in 2017 102 in 2018 54 in 2019 150 in 2020 and 86 in 2021 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

 17  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

fda 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

  

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed pursuant to 510k premarketing clearances and are either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using 

  

 18  

available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fda’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices 

  

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

  

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration and in canada with health canada 

  

other healthcare laws 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

 19  

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act 

  

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation 

  

also many states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs 

  

under hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech which we collectively refer to as hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations including the hipaa privacy security and breach notification rules to protect the privacy and security of protected health information or phi used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

  

in some of our operations such as those involving our cloudbased software digital health applications we are a business associate under hipaa and therefore required to comply with the hipaa security rule breach notification rule and certain provisions of the hipaa privacy rule and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 

  

numerous other state federal and foreign laws including consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection dissemination use access to confidentiality and security of patient health information in addition congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that 

  

 20  

further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information with the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach such as prompt disclosure to affected customers generally these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches the federal trade commission or ftc and states’ attorneys general have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair andor deceptive acts or practices under the ftc act in addition to data breach notification laws some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information these laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies we intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information 

  

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities the physician payment sunshine act was enacted in law as part of aca which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them directly or indirectly to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members a manufacturer’s failure to submit timely accurately and completely the required information for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

  

the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2016 we had approximately 5250 employees or fulltime consultants of which approximately 1745 were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 805 in research and development and 2700 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1545 were located in north and latin america 1400 in australia 1280 in europe and 1025 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the 

  

 21  

other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

  

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities in some markets to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations many home health care dealers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods 

  

 22  

and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer in fiscal 2016 we completed a number of acquisitions including among others the acquisition of brightree curative medical and inova labs the success of these acquisitions as well as our other recent acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the business and operations of the acquired companies and fully realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 39 and 43 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 35 to 40 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

 23  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products  our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

  

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma under the program our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas in addition under the aca in 2016 cms adjusted the prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1 2016 and were fully effective july 1 2016 this program has significantly reduced the medicare reimbursement to our customers compared with reimbursement in 2011 at the beginning of the program 

  

we cannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition 

  

healthcare reform including recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the aca was signed into law in the united states the aca made changes that significantly impacted the healthcare industry including medical device manufacturers one of the principal purposes of the aca was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who were uninsured the aca required adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the aca also contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this included new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products the medical device tax was suspended for 2016 and 2017 calendar years but is scheduled to return beginning in 2018 in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the aca also included among other things demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patient 

  

 24  

centered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payers for our products and decreased profits to us 

  

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things creates the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers including home healthcare companies of 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 or the atra was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

  

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states 

  

the aca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations  although we do not provide healthcare services submit claims for thirdparty reimbursement or receive payments directly from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors for our products we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country 

  

in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to 

  

   

   

 25  

   

   

   

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry for example in july 2016 we received a federal administrative subpoena from the office of inspector general “oig” of the department of health and human services the subpoena contains a request for documents and other materials that relate primarily to industry offerings of patient resupply software to home medical equipment providers we are cooperating with the oig to respond to its requests for documents and information responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these investigations healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business 

  

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

  

our use and disclosure of individually identifiable information including health information is subject to federal state and foreign privacy and security regulations and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm the privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored maintained received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies legal standards for privacy including but not limited to ‘‘unfairness’’ and ‘‘deception’’ as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose audience and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business recently there has been an increase in public 

  

 26  

awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacyrelated lawsuits filed against companies concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personally identifiable information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws could damage our reputation and harm our business 

  

numerous foreign federal and state laws and regulations govern collection dissemination use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information including i state privacy and confidentiality laws including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches ii hipaa and iii european and other foreign data protection laws 

  

hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information including what is known as protected health information by health plans healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically or covered entities and their ‘‘business associates’’ which are persons or entities that perform certain services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information certain portions of our business such as the cloudbased software digital health applications are subject to hipaa as a business associate of our covered entities clients to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of phi hipaa requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa as a business associate we are also directly liable for compliance with hipaa 

  

mandatory penalties for hipaa violations range from 100 to 50000 per violation up to 15 million per violation of the same standard per calendar year a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards resulting in possible penalties potentially in excess of 15 million if a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses phi in violation of hipaa requirements criminal penalties may also be imposed 

  

hipaa authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under hipaa on behalf of state residents courts can award damages costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of hipaa in such cases while hipaa does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for hipaa violations its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of phi 

  

hipaa further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” covered entities must notify affected individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach” if their unsecured phi is subject to an unauthorized access use or disclosure if a breach affects 500 patients or more covered entities must report it to hhs and local media without unreasonable delay and hhs will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website if a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals the covered entity must log it and notify hhs at least annually 

  

if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us our solutions may be perceived as not secure we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions in addition if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients we are liable not only contractually but also directly under hipaa 

  

our business activities are subject to extensive regulation and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we 

  

 27  

are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the food and drug administration or the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

  

actual or attempted breaches of security unauthorized disclosure of information denial of service attacks or the perception that personal andor other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure could result in a material loss of business substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation we receive collect process use and store a large amount of information from clients and our own employees including personally identifiable protected health and other sensitive and confidential information this data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks including the internet the secure transmission of such information over the internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems we have implemented security measures technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify detect and prevent unauthorized access alteration use or disclosure of our and our clients’ and employees’ data however there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security beyond external criminal activity systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations 

  

if someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems they could steal any information located therein or cause interruptions to our operations security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss andor litigation fines and sanctions we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data while we maintain insurance that covers certain security and privacy breaches we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability 

  

we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security including hipaa complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny fines and civil liability in addition any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information additional costs associated with repairing any system damage incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches including organizational changes deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies employee training and engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants furthermore these rules are constantly changing for example the useu safe harbor framework has been declared invalid and the euus privacy shield framework has recently been formally adopted by the european commission additionally the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial 

  

we cannot assure you that any of our thirdparty service providers with access to our or our clients andor employees’ personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof which could have a corresponding effect on our business

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline unless a product is exempt before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process 

  

for example the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fda’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

 29  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities our business activities include contacts with consumers in different parts of the world certain laws such as the us telephone consumer protection act regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts with consumers such as phone calls texts or emails our use of outbound contacts may be restricted by existing laws or by laws regulations or regulatory decisions that may be adopted in the future if we are found to have violated these laws or regulations we may be subjected to substantial fines penalties or liabilities to consumers 

  

our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products or for other reasons we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints we our competitors or other third parties may also conduct clinical trials involving our commercially marketed products the results of clinical trials may be unfavorable or inconsistent with previous findings or could identify safety signals associated with our products for example in may 2015 we announced the preliminary analysis of the data from the servehf clinical trial which was designed to assess whether the treatment of moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea with adaptive servoventilation or asv therapy could reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure the preliminary headline results showed no significant difference with respect to allcause mortality and hospitalization however the analysis of the data identified a statistically significant 25 absolute increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for those patients in the trial who received asv therapy with moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea and symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction we worked with global regulatory authorities to revise the labels and instructions for use for resmed asv devices as well as informing healthcare providers physicians and patients of the cardiovascular safety signal observed in servehf current or future clinical trials may not meet primary endpoints may reveal disadvantages of our products and solutions for various markets we address or could generate unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data clinical data or the market’s or regulatory bodies’ perception of the clinical data may adversely 

  

 30  

impact our ability to obtain product clearances or approvals and our position in and share of the markets in which we participate moreover if these clinical trials identify serious safety issues associated with our marketed products potentially adverse consequences could result including that regulatory authorities could withdraw clearances or approvals of our products we could be required to halt the marketing and sales of our products or recall our products we could be required to update our product labeling with additional warnings we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our reputation may suffer any of these could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fdacleared products in particular clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our 

  

 31  

products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed on proprietary rights of others for example we are involved in litigation with our competitor bmc medical co ltd and its us distributor 3b medical to enforce patents against bmc’s and 3b’s alleged infringement in the us and other countries similarly bmc has asserted claims against us in china to enforce claims that we have infringed on its patents the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world any final assessment resulting from such audits may result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

 32  

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally some of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of their assets as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition investors may not be able to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts where most of these assets and persons reside 

  

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure  our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

  

 33  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile commodity prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability 

  

our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business as of june 30 2016 our total consolidated debt was approximately 12 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness which could impede our growth our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

we have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions of brightree curative medical and inova labs that may prove to be materially inaccurate we have made certain assumptions relating to our recent acquisitions of brightree curative medical and inova labs including for example 

  

   

   

   

   

while management has made such assumptions in good faith and believes them to be reasonable the assumptions may turn out to be materially inaccurate including for reasons beyond our control if these assumptions are incorrect we may change or modify our assumptions such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may writeoff intangible assets such as goodwill we have recorded intangible assets including goodwill in connection with our recent acquisitions of brightree curative medical and inova labs at least on an annual basis we will evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate 

  

 34  

any impairment of the values of these intangible assets as circumstances change we cannot assure you that the value of these intangible assets will be realized by us if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred we will be required to writeoff the impaired portion of intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the writeoff occurs 

  

prior to our acquisitions of brightree curative medical and inova labs those companies were each privatelyheld and their new obligations of being a part of a public company may require significant resources and management attention upon consummation of the respective acquisitions of brightree curative medical and inova labs the acquired entities became subsidiaries of our consolidated company and will need to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the sec and the public company accounting oversight board we will need to ensure that each of the acquired companies establishes and maintains effective disclosure controls as well as internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and such compliance efforts may be costly and may divert the attention of management

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the jurisdictions where our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between 19 and 20 these and future effective tax rate fluctuations resulted from and depend on numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax credit is available the level of foreign earnings repatriated to the us the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits and benefits available to us under applicable tax laws including the lower statutory tax rates and incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which 

  

 51  

results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns depends on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2016 using a quantitative assessment the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

  

4 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made alternatively if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results 

  

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws although currently immaterial we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes based on our regular assessment we may adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  

 52  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 

  

6 revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment which is when title transfers to the customer we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue 

  

we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders onetime special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations for multipleelement arrangements we allocate arrangement consideration to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendorspecific objective evidence 

  

we also generate revenue from timebased licensing of our software and associated services in most instances revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprising subscription fees and professional services which typically have contract terms of one to three years we evaluate each element in these multipleelement arrangements to determine whether they represent a separate unit of accounting and recognize each element as the services are performed 

  

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation cost of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and 

  

 53  

implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we use historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the blackscholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to during the vesting period we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units or prsus which contain a market condition using a montecarlo simulation valuation model

we are a global leader in the development manufacturing distribution and marketing of medical products for the diagnosis treatment and management of respiratory disorders with a focus on sleepdisordered breathing or sdb sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion our research and product development efforts and an increasing awareness of sdb and respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients around the world 

  

we employ approximately 4340 people and sell our products in approximately 100 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors suppliers developers of medical equipment and related technologies 

  

segment information 

  

we believe that given the single market focus of our operations in the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry and the interdependence of its products we operate in a single operating segment see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa 

  

 2  

typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

a 2013 update to a longterm epidemiology study estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 46 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with congestive heart failure 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

  

there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry evidence continues to mount supporting the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction 

  

 3  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty and nasal devices alternative treatments reported to be under development include pharmaceutical therapies and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles 

  

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sdb more effectively increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 2012 we introduced swift fx bella mask pixi pediatric mask quattro fx for her and the easycare compliance management solution in 2013 we 

  

 4  

introduced new products across both our mask and flow generator categories including the vpap copd quattro air swift fx bella swift fx nano and resmed’s sleepseeker in 2014 we introduced the airfit™ p10 nasal pillows system airfit™ n10 nasal mask airfit™ f10 fullface mask and the astral™ platform our new generation of life support ventilators during fiscal year 2015 we released significant new products across our flow generator categories including the airsense tm 10 aircurve tm 10  and lumis in 2015 we also released the airview tm  our cloudbased remote monitoring and therapy management system along with our air solutions platform that provides a suite of endtoend healthcare informatics solutions that address customer business processes from diagnosis to monitoring and patient management and billing we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 13 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2015 we invested 1149 million or approximately 7 of our net revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in more than 100 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and thirdparty payors we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target both the population with predisposition to sdb and medical specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation in concert with other industry participants we sponsor educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sdb or osa and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2014 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular diseases 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb

mask systems and diagnostic products 

  

mask systems are one of the most important elements of sdb treatment systems masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy we have been a consistent innovator in masks improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight 

  



  

 10  

we market sleep recorders for the diagnosis and titration of sdb in sleep clinics and hospitals these diagnostic systems record relevant respiratory and sleep data which can be analyzed by a sleep specialist or physician who can then tailor an appropriate osa treatment regimen for the patient 

  



  

accessories and other products 

  

to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as easycare reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers helping to prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort carry bags and breathing circuits with the introduction of our latest generation of flow generators we are expanding our use of cloudbased patient management and engagement platforms such as airview and myair enabling remote monitoring overtheair trouble shooting and changing of device settings

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in many countries including the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland china and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors customers and patients 

  

in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 we invested 1149 million 1182 million and 1201 million respectively on research and development

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in more than 100 countries through a network of distributors and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 15 – segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in north and latin america our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout north and latin america 

  

we also market our products directly to physicians and sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 57 54 and 56 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria czech republic finland france germany ireland netherlands norway poland sweden switzerland and the united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from thirdparty payors 

  

sales in europe accounted for 32 36 and 33 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

market growth opportunities 

  

we view the future as having three horizons of growth within the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry the first horizon includes our existing market in osa treatment where telemedicine is becoming an important factor the use of technologies that allow remote collection and transfer of information may change the current clinical pathways for following 

  

 13  

up patients on our devices and provides an opportunity to improve our services we are investing in expanding our capabilities in this area 

  

the second horizon includes the use of our devices for the treatment of respiratory failure both in the hospital and the home an area of growth is expected to be in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd which is an increasingly common chronic disease some patients with advanced copd may benefit from the use of ventilation at night but until recently only a small number of copd patients were treated using ventilation on a long term basis a study published in 2014 has demonstrated a reduction in mortality and an improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity in copd patients with stable but severe disease using noninvasive ventilation or niv nightly for 6 months the findings from this study and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in the size of the homecare market for niv additionally the use of niv is becoming routine in most acute care hospitals as guidelines stipulate its use in acute exacerbations and familiarity with the techniques involved increases the second horizon also includes several initiatives to expand our presence in high growth and emerging markets including china india and brazil 

  

the focus of the third horizon is the cardiology market and respiratory monitoring solutions for heart failure and copd there is a growing body of literature documenting the association and interactions between a number of cardiac diseases and sdb osa is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is prevalent in hypertensive populations particularly those resistant to therapy treatment with cpap tends to lower blood pressure osa is prevalent in those with atrial fibrillation and may trigger episodes of fibrillation treatment with cpap appears to improve outcomes osa is also known to be a strong risk factor for the development of acute coronary disease and cardiovascular disease in general heart failure is also commonly associated with both osa and csa and both forms of sdb are risk factors for poor outcomes we are undertaking several clinical trials in cardiology to strengthen the knowledge base on the effects of sdb therapy on outcomes in addition to clinical trials we pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients 

  

we are also continuing our work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes osa is common in diabetic patient populations and those with metabolic syndrome osa has a number of deleterious effects in these diseases and importantly raises the risk of cardiovascular disease if left untreated 

  

we are also working with occupational health professionals to raise awareness of the issues caused by untreated osa in the workplace including accidents absenteeism and reduced productivity plus increased costs for employers who provide healthcare coverage for employees 

  

we continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets 

  

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us any reduction or halt in supply from one of these singlesource suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts 

  

 14  

and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell all of our manufacturing sites are accredited to iso 13485 these sites are subject to thirdparty audits conducted by the iso notified bodies at regular intervals 

  

details of our main manufacturing facilities are 

  



  

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payors outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

 15  

the past decade of legislative reform in the united states including by way of example the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma has significantly impacted reimbursement for products that we provide the longer term impact though not entirely predictable continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape 

  

beginning in 2005 the mma established a medicare competitive acquisition program for hme and imposed quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers effective 2011 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms implemented the first round of competitive bidding in 9 competitive bidding areas or cbas and included home medical equipment that we manufacture and develop specifically cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the first round of competitive bidding implemented was approximately 32 overall and 34 for cpap and respiratory devices in 2013 cms announced the single payment amounts for the second round which covered a total of 91 cbas for cpap and respiratory devices the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the second round was approximately 47 on a weighted average basis cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years in addition cms has announced it will use single payment amounts established by competitive bidding to set payment rates in areas not subject to competitive bidding new rates will be phased in beginning january 1 2016 and fully effective july 1 2016 

  

the ppaca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources includes among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products the ppaca also provides for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services and a requirement that by 2016 the competitive bidding process must be rolledout nationally or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices 

  

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the ppaca or any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

 16  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us our primary competitors include philips bv devilbiss healthcare fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors such as weinmann geräte für medizin gmbh  co kg are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them finally our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this annual report we own or have licensed rights to approximately 958 issued united states patents including approximately 380 design patents and approximately 1737 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 458 pending united states patent applications including approximately 54 design patent applications approximately 1003 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1180 registered foreign designs and 146 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 168 united states patents and 395 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years there are 15 foreign patents due to expire in 2016 28 in 2017 109 in 2018 61 in 2019 and 182 in 2020 there are 5 united states patents due to expire in 2016 22 united states patents in 2017 53 united states patents in 2018 17 united states patents in 2019 and 71 united states patents in 2020 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

fda 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar 

  

 17  

regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

  

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fda’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices 

  

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to 

  

 18  

inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

  

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration and in canada with health canada 

  

other healthcare laws 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act 

  

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims 

  

 19  

act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation 

  

also many states and countries outside the us have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs 

  

under hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers such as us hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

  

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities the physician payment sunshine act was enacted in law as part of ppaca which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them directly or indirectly to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members a manufacturer’s failure to submit timely accurately and completely the required information for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

  

the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations 

  

 20  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2015 we had approximately 4340 employees or fulltime consultants of which approximately 1660 were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 570 in research and development and 2110 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1360 were located in australia 890 in north and latin america 1330 in europe and 760 in asia

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

  

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in 

  

 21  

addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations many home health care dealers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions into our operations and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 43 and 46 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 45 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

  

   

   

   

   

 22  

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

  

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development affecting reimbursement negatively stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma under the program our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas under ppaca by 2016 the competitive bidding process must either be rolledout nationally or medicare prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be reduced to match competitive bidding prices 

  

we cannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition 

  

healthcare reform including recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states the ppaca makes changes that are expected to impact the medical device industry one of the principal purposes of the ppaca was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who were uninsured the ppaca requires adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the ppaca also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this includes new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries 

  

 23  

including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the ppaca also includes among other things demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payers for our products and decreased profits to us 

  

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things creates the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers including home healthcare companies of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 or the atra was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

  

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states 

  

the ppaca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations although we do not provide healthcare services submit claims for thirdparty reimbursement or receive payments directly from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors for our products we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to 

  

   

   

 24  

   

   

   

   

   

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these investigations healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country 

  

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect 

  

 25  

on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline unless a product is exempt before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process 

  

for example the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fda’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more 

  

 26  

rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unfavorable or perceived as unfavorable and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties or the market’s or regulatory bodies’ perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fdacleared products in particular clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government 

  

 27  

healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and 

  

 28  

prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions any final assessment resulting from such audits could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors 

  

 29  

constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally some of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of their assets as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition investors may not be able to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts where most of these assets and persons reside 

  

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile commodity prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims litigation is inherently uncertain accordingly we cannot predict the outcome of these matters but we do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements when taken as a whole 

  

in 2013 we filed actions in the us and germany against chinese manufacturer bmc medical co ltd and its us distributor 3b medical inc to stop the infringement of several resmed patents the 

  

 31  

us international trade commission initiated an investigation and in december 2014 ruled that certain of bmc’s masks infringed resmed’s patents and should be excluded from importation or sale in the us bmc subsequently notified the commission that it discontinued us sales of the mask products affected by the commission’s order the international trade commission also ruled that the claims of the patent against bmc’s humidifier patent were anticipated by prior art invalidated those claims and declined to exclude bmc’s humidifier products from importation or sale each party has appealed the international trade commission’s ruling a companion case in the united states district court for the southern district of california remains stayed pending those appeals in 2013 we obtained preliminary injunctions prohibiting bmc from marketing and selling certain flow generators and mask assemblies accused of patent infringement in germany the preliminary injunction against bmc’s mask assemblies remains in effect but in november 2014 the court dissolved the preliminary injunction against the sale of bmc’s flow generators and the court’s action dissolving that preliminary injunction was affirmed on appeal resmed continues to pursue the underlying german patent infringement action against bmcs flow generators and mask assemblies 

  

in 2015 bmc’s us distributor 3b medical inc filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against resmed inc and resmed corp for alleged federal and state antitrust violations specifically 3b medical alleges that in addition to enforcing its patents resmed has entered into exclusive dealing arrangements with customers tied sales of masks to sales of flow generators and spread false information that 3b would go out of business due to resmed’s patent infringement action 3b medical seeks damages and an injunction resmed inc has been dismissed from the case and resmed corp has denied the allegations

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 45  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns depends on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2015 using a quantitative assessment the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value 

  

4 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date where we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense could have a material effect on our operating results 

  

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws although currently immaterial we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate 

  

 46  

support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 

  

6 revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment which is when title transfers to the customer we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue 

  

we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders onetime special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation cost of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we use historical rates 

  

 47  

by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the blackscholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to during the vesting period we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units or prsus which contain a market condition using a montecarlo simulation valuation model

general 

  

we are a global leader in the development manufacturing distribution and marketing of medical products for the diagnosis treatment and management of respiratory disorders with a focus on sleepdisordered breathing or sdb sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion our research and product development efforts and an increasing awareness of sdb and respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients around the world 

  

we employ approximately 4100 people and sell our products in approximately 100 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of businesses including distributors suppliers developers of medical equipment and related technologies 

  

segment information 

  

we believe that given the single market focus of our operations in the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry and the interdependence of its products we operate in a single operating segment see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa 

  

 2  

typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

a 2013 epidemiology study estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 46 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with congestive heart failure 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

  

there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry evidence continues to mount supporting the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty and nasal devices alternative treatments reported to be under development include pharmaceutical therapies and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles 

  

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sdb more effectively increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 2011 we introduced the s9 bilevel range of flow generators the quattro fx full face mask the swift fx for her nasal pillow mask the mirage fx nasal mask 

  

 4  

the mirage fx for her nasal mask and the stellar ventilation device in 2012 we introduced swift fx bella mask pixi pediatric mask quattro fx for her and the easycare compliance management solution in 2013 we introduced new products across both our mask and flow generator categories including the vpap copd quattro air swift fx bella swift fx nano and resmed’s sleepseeker in 2014 we introduced the airfit™ p10 nasal pillows system airfit™ n10 nasal mask airfit™ f10 fullface mask and the astral™ platform our new generation of life support ventilators we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 13 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2014 we invested 1182 million or approximately 8 of our net revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in more than 100 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and thirdparty payors we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target both the population with predisposition to sdb and medical specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation in concert with other industry participants we sponsor educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sdb or osa and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation which utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb

we view the future as having three horizons of growth within the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry the first horizon includes our existing market in osa treatment where telemedicine is becoming an important factor the use of technologies that allow remote collection and transfer of information may change the current clinical pathways for following up patients on our devices and provides an opportunity to improve our services we are investing in expanding our capabilities in this area 

  

the second horizon includes the use of our devices for the treatment of respiratory failure both in the hospital and the home an area of growth is expected to be in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd which is an increasingly common chronic disease some patients with advanced copd may benefit from the use of ventilation at night but until recently only a small number of copd patients were treated using ventilation on a long term basis a study published in 2014 has demonstrated a reduction in mortality and an improvement in quality of life and exercise capacity in copd patients with stable but severe disease using noninvasive ventilation or niv nightly for 6 months the findings from this study and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in the size of the homecare market for niv additionally the use of niv is becoming routine in most acute care hospitals as guidelines stipulate its use in acute exacerbations and familiarity with the techniques involved increases 

  

the focus of the third horizon is the cardiology market there is a growing body of evidence concerning the links between cardiology diseases and sdb it is established that osa is a secondary cause of hypertension and is common in hypertensive populations particularly those resistant to therapy osa is related to atrial fibrillation with a high prevalence in patients and there is a strong association between osa and stroke with a high prevalence in the period after a stroke osa is also known to be a strong risk factor for the development of acute coronary disease and cardiovascular disease in general our main focus in cardiology is on heart failure as it is the most costly of the cardiac diseases in western societies we have developed a device which effectively treats central sleep apnea a form of breathing seen in approximately a third of chronic heart failure patients and which is associated with a poor prognosis and risk of readmission to the hospital we are performing two clinical trials to show the efficacy of this device in treating heart failure in addition to clinical trials we pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients the findings from the two clinical trials and our associated marketing activities may result in an increase in demand for our devices 

  

we are also continuing our work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes osa is common in diabetic patient populations and those with metabolic syndrome osa has a number of deleterious effects in these diseases and importantly raises the risk of cardiovascular disease if left untreated this association is being recognized by diabetologists and patients and in june 2008 the international diabetes federation or idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a 

  

 13  

comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes recommending screening for osasdb in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years we are also actively engaged with groups such as diabetes nurse educators to further raise awareness 

  

we are also working with occupational health professionals to raise awareness of the issues caused by untreated osa in the workplace including accidents absenteeism and reduced productivity plus increased costs for employers who provide healthcare coverage for employees 

  

we continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets 

  

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us any reduction or halt in supply from one of these singlesource suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility we have a 174000 square foot assembly and distribution facility in south carolina the plant specializes in regional customization of our flow generators we have a 95000 square foot manufacturing facility in singapore to complement the sydney manufacturing site the plant assembles masks flow generators and electric motors we have a 46000 square foot manufacturing facility in malaysia the plant specializes in the manufacture of headgear material for our masks and accessories we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france the facility is primarily responsible for the assembly of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in freudenstadt germany the plant specializes in the manufacture of medical humidification products we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at a 72000 square foot manufacturing facility in chatsworth california 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell all of our manufacturing sites are accredited to iso 13485 these sites are subject to thirdparty audits conducted by the iso notified bodies at regular intervals 

  

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payors outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors for our products 

  

 14  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payors directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payors include government payors such as medicare and medicaid and commercial health insurance plans these payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

the past decade of legislative reform in the united states including by way of example the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma has significantly impacted reimbursement for products that we provide the longer term impact though not entirely predictable continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payor landscape 

  

beginning in 2005 the mma reduced payment amounts for five categories of hme froze payment amounts for certain covered home medical equipment hme items through 2007 established a medicare competitive acquisition program for hme and imposed quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers the dra capped the medicare rental period for certain capped rental items including cpap devices at 13 months of continuous use after which time title of the equipment would transfer automatically to the beneficiary mippa retroactively delayed the implementation of competitive bidding for eighteen months and decreased the 2009 medicare fee schedule payment amounts for hme by 95 for product categories included in competitive bidding in addition on an annual basis legislativelydefined update factors are applied by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms to the medicare fee schedule payment amounts for 2013 the fee schedule amounts were increased by 08 and for 2014 by 10 

  

effective january 1 2011 cms implemented the first round of competitive bidding in 9 competitive bidding areas or cbas and included home medical equipment that we manufacture and develop specifically cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the first round of competitive bidding implemented was approximately 32 overall and 34 for cpap and respiratory devices on january 30 2013 cms announced the single payment amounts for the second round which covered a total of 91 cbas for cpap and respiratory devices the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the second round was approximately 47 on a weighted average basis effective july 1 2013 cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years accordingly on july 15 2014 cms announced plans to conduct a round 2 recompete where suppliers awarded contracts in the second round of competitive bidding will recompete cms expects to announce the bidding schedule in fall 2014 

  

the ppaca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources includes among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products the ppaca also provides 

  

 15  

for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services and a requirement that by 2016 the competitive bidding process must be rolledout nationally or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices 

  

we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the ppaca or any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us our primary competitors include philips bv devilbiss healthcare fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd and regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors such as weinmann geräte für medizin gmbh  co kg are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them finally our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

through our various subsidiaries as of the date of this annual report we own or have licensed rights to approximately 859 issued united states patents including approximately 369 design patents and approximately 1535 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 462 pending united 

  

 16  

states patent applications including approximately 63 design patent applications approximately 909 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1162 registered foreign designs and 74 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 156 united states patents and 229 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years there are 36 foreign patents due to expire in 2015 12 in 2016 28 in 2017 98 in 2018 and 55 in 2019 there are 22 united states patents due to expire in 2015 7 united states patents in 2016 29 united states patents in 2017 63 united states patents in 2018 and 35 united states patents in 2019 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

fda 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the design development research preclinical and clinical testing introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil and administrative penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness 

  

our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device” as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which 

  

 17  

can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved after a device has received 510k clearance for a specific intended use any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness such as a significant change in the design materials method of manufacture or intended use may require a new 510k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance however the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510k clearance or pma approval is obtained the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fda’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices 

  

any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies these include product listing and establishment registration requirements which help facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory actions as a medical device manufacturer all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements as set forth in the qsr which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process noncompliance with these standards can result in among other things fines injunctions civil penalties recalls or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance or pma approval of devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 

  

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted offlabel uses may be subject to significant liability including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical 

  

 18  

device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration and in canada with health canada 

  

other healthcare laws 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices including without limitation antikickback false claims physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws the government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

the federal antikickback statute prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for or the purchase lease order or recommendation of any good facility item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid in addition a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act 

  

the federal civil false claims act prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the us government the civil false claims act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled such as a rebate intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil false claims act 

  

the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services like the antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation 

  

also many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor in addition to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs 

  

under hipaa the department of health and human services or hhs has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers such as us hipaa also regulates standardization of data content codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties in addition to federal privacy and security regulations there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business new laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

  

 19  

additionally there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities the physician payment sunshine act was enacted in law as part of ppaca which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them directly or indirectly to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members a manufacturer’s failure to submit timely accurately and completely the required information for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices andor require the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities 

  

the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2014 we had approximately 4100 employees or fulltime consultants of which approximately 1620 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 550 in research and development and 1930 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1260 were located in australia 820 in north and latin america 1320 in europe and 700 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our 

  

 20  

products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

  

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations many home health care dealers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of market power as the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition andor cash flows may suffer 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain 

  

 21  

qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions into our operations and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 46 and 44 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 45 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

  

 22  

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a development affecting reimbursement negatively stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma under the program our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas under ppaca by 2016 the competitive bidding process must either be rolledout nationally or medicare prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be reduced to match competitive bidding prices 

  

the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms the agency responsible for administering the medicare program rolled out the competitive bidding program in 9 cbas and included home medical equipment or hme such as oxygen and oxygen equipment cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories on july 2 2010 cms announced the single payment amount – the amount paid to successful bidders – for the first round of the competitive bidding and began offering contracts to qualifying home health companies effective january 1 2011 the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in this first round of competitive bidding was approximately 32 overall and 34 for cpap and respiratory devices and became effective january 1 2011 on january 30 2013 cms announced the single payment amounts for the second round which cover a total of 91 cbas for cpap and respiratory devices the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the second round was approximately 47 on a weighted average basis effective july 1 2013 cms is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years accordingly on july 15 2014 cms announced plans to conduct a round 2 recompete where suppliers awarded contracts in the second round of competitive bidding will recompete cms is expected to announce the bidding schedule for the recompete in fall 2014 

  

we cannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition 

  

healthcare reform including recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states the ppaca makes changes that are expected to impact the medical device industry one of the principal purposes of the ppaca was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who were uninsured the ppaca requires adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the ppaca also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this includes new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above the ppaca also includes among other things demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the

increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payers for our products and decreased profits to us 

  

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things creates the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers including home healthcare companies of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect on april 1 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 or the atra was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

  

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states 

  

the ppaca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations although we do not provide healthcare services submit claims for thirdparty reimbursement or receive payments directly from medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payors for our products we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal state and foreign governments which could significantly impact our business in the united states the laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

 24  

   

   

   

the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry responding to investigations can be timeand resourceconsuming and can divert management’s attention from the business additionally as a result of these investigations healthcare providers and entities may have to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws which vary by country 

  

if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from governmental health care programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to extensive us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline unless a product is exempt before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process the 510k clearance process can be expensive timeconsuming and uncertain in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process 

  

for example the fda is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510k for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination it is unclear whether the fda’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510k is required for changes or modifications to existing devices the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions fda continues to review its 510k clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

 26  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fdacleared products in particular clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties it is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an offlabel use which could result in significant penalties including but not limited to criminal civil and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the 

  

 27  

increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions any final assessment resulting from such audits could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

 28  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally some of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of their assets as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition investors may not be able to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts where most of these assets and persons reside

we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation business operations or financial condition of the company in addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities 

  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the united states mortgage market a declining residential real estate market in the united states and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile commodity prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability

we have initiated several legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights 

  

in 2013 we initiated actions in the us and germany against taiwanese manufacturer apex to stop the infringement of several resmed patents in 2013 the us international trade commission entered a consent order against apex ordering that it not import or sell after import products that infringe the claims of the patents that resmed asserted against apex in 2014 the itc found that certain products redesigned by apex were covered by the consent order and that certain products were not in 2014 the munich district court ruled that it intends to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting apex from marketing and selling certain products in germany these proceedings are ongoing 

  

in 2013 we filed actions in the us and germany against chinese manufacturer bmc medical co ltd to stop the infringement of several resmed patents the us international trade commission 

  

 31  

initiated an investigation in 2013 but has not yet made a decision in its matter in 2013 we obtained a preliminary injunction prohibiting bmc from marketing and selling certain products accused of patent infringement in germany it remains in effect until november 2014 proceedings in germany continue regarding other resmed patents 

  

litigation is inherently uncertain accordingly we cannot predict the outcome of these matters but we do not expect the outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements when taken as a whole

overview 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc and subsidiaries it is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market in our efforts we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity 

  

there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry evidence continues to mount supporting the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction the following three recent studies support the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction 

  

   

   

   

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2014 we invested approximately 1182 million on research and development activities which represents approximately 8 of net revenues since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories during fiscal year 2014 we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories including the airfit™ p10 airfit™ n10 and airfit™f10 masks and the astral™ our new generation life support ventilator the release of these products as well as the release of vpap copd quattro air swift fx bella swift fx nano and resmed’s sleepseeker in fiscal 2013 and a robust product pipeline will continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth 

  

net revenue in fiscal year 2014 increased to 15550 million an increase of 3 compared to fiscal year 2013 gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 9898 million from 9407

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 15550 million from 15145 million for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 405 million or 3 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories partially offset by a decline in average selling prices movements in international currencies against the us dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately 170 million for the year ended june 30 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2014 increased by 2 compared to the year ended june 30 2013 

  

net revenue in north and latin america decreased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 8391 million from 8516 million for the year ended june 30 2013 a decrease of 125 million or 1 the decrease in net revenue is primarily attributable to increased competitor activity and a decline in average selling prices partially offset by an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 7158 million from 6628 million for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 530 million or 8 movements in international currencies against the us dollar favorably impacted international revenues by approximately 170 million during the year ended june 30 2014 excluding the impact of foreign currency movements international sales for the year ended june 30 2014 increased by 5 compared to the year ended june 30 2013 the increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories 

  

net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30 2014 totaled 8467 million from 8235 million for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 3 including an increase of 7 outside north and latin america and a decrease of 2 in north and latin america net revenue from masks and other accessories totaled 7083 million an increase of 3 including an increase of 10 outside north and latin america and a 1 decrease in north and latin america for the year ended june 30 2014 compared to the year ended june 30 2013

 constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 9898 million from 9407 million for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 491 million or 5 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 637 for the year ended june 30 2014 compared with the 621 for the year ended june 30 2013 the improvement in gross margins was primarily due to cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales positive foreign currency impact due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar and euro and a favorable geographic mix of sales partially offset by declines in our average selling prices 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 4504 million from 4308 million for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 196 million or 5 the selling general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the us dollar which decreased our expenses by approximately 46 million as reported in us dollars excluding the impact of foreign currency movements selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2014 increased by 6 compared to the year ended june 30 2013 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2014 was 290 compared to 284 for the year ended june 30 2013 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb as well as an increase in our patent litigation expenses 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased for the year ended june 30 2014 to 1182 million from 1201 million for the year ended june 30 2013 a decrease of 19 million or 2 the research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the depreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar which decreased our expenses by approximately 90 million as reported in us dollars excluding the impact of foreign currency movements research and development expenses for the year ended june 30 2014 increased by 6 compared to the year ended june 30 2013 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 76 for the year ended june 30 2014 compared to 79 for the year ended june 30 2013 

  

the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel consulting and contractor expenses and an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2014 totaled 97 million compared to 101 million for the year ended june 30 2013

restructuring expenses during the year ended june 30 2014 we completed a reorganization of our commercial and research and development teams as a result of this reorganization we terminated the employment of approximately 1 of our employees at a total cost of 63 million 

  

total other income net total other income net for the year ended june 30 2014 was 260 million a decrease of 43 million compared with 303 million for the year ended june 30 2013 the decrease in total other income net was due primarily to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held and the depreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar partially offset by gains on foreign currency transactions 

  

income taxes  our effective income tax rate decreased to 199 for the year ended june 30 2014 from 202 for the year ended june 30 2013 our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30 2020 as of june 30 2014 we have not provided for us income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries we intend these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 

  

net income and earnings per share as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2014 was 3453 million compared to net income of 3071 million for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 12 over the year ended june 30 2013 as a result of the increase in our net income and lower share count due to our stock repurchases our earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2014 was 239 per diluted share compared to 210 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2013 an increase of 14 over the year ended june 30 2013 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2013 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2012 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 15145 million from 13685 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 1459 million or 11 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately 151 million for the year ended june 30 2013 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2013 increased by 12 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 8516 million from 7490 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 1026 million or 14 we believe this increase primarily reflected growth in the overall sdb market and market share gains in the apap and bilevel flow generator segments 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 6628 million from 6195 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 434 million or 7 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements international sales for the year ended june 30 2013 increased by 9 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 we believe this increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sdb market 

  

net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30 2013 totaled 8235 million from 7366 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 12 including increases of 18 in north and latin america and 7 elsewhere net revenue from mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 6909 million an increase of 9 including increases of 11 in north and latin

america and 7 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2013 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 we believe these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sdb market and market share gains in the apap and bilevel flow generator segments 

  

the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue for the year ended june 30 2013 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 

  



  

 constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 9407 million from 8207 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 1199 million or 15 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 621 for the year ended june 30 2013 compared with the 600 for the year ended june 30 2012 the improvement in gross margins was primarily due to cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements and favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales partially offset by declines in our average selling prices 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 4308 million from 4026 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 282 million or 7 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2013 was 28 compared to 29 for the year ended june 30 2012 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 1201 million from 1097 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 104 million or 9 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 8 for the year ended june 30 2013 compared to 8 for the year ended june 30 2012 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel consulting and contractor expenses and an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products 

  

education research and settlement charge during the year ended june 30 2013 we agreed to pay the university of sydney 248 million to establish two perpetual academic chairs fund future research in the fields of sleep medicine and biomedical engineering and settle legal proceedings between us we expensed the full amount of 248 million 177 million net of tax in the year ended june 30 2013 within our operating expenses and separately disclosed the amount as an education research and settlement charge 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2013 totaled 101 million compared to 140 million for the year ended june 30 2012 the reduction in amortization expense was mainly attributable to certain acquired intangibles reaching the end of their useful life and therefore being fully amortized 

  

 42  

total other income net total other income net for the year ended june 30 2013 was 303 million a decrease of 72 million compared with 375 million for the year ended june 30 2012 the decrease in total other income net was due primarily to losses on foreign currency transactions partially offset by an increase in interest income due primarily to an increase in cash balances held 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 202 for the year ended june 30 2013 from 232 for the year ended june 30 2012 the lower effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of our taxable income including the lower statutory tax rates and other incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations 

  

net income as a result of the factors above and share repurchases our net income and earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2013 was 3071 million or 210 per diluted share compared to net income of 2549 million or 171 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 21 and 23 respectively over the year ended june 30 2012 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of june 30 2014 and june 30 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 9057 million and 8760 million respectively working capital was 13 billion and 8748 million at june 30 2014 and june 30 2013 respectively the increase in working capital balance is primarily due to the renewal of our long term credit facility 

  

as of june 30 2014 and june 30 2013 our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to 290 million and 382 million respectively our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30 2014 and june 30 2013 of 8767 million and 8378 million respectively were held by our nonus subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions 

  

as of june 30 2014 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 15 billion and those undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested we intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently if these earnings had not been permanently reinvested deferred taxes of approximately 344 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

  

we repatriated 191 million and 185 million to the us in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively from earnings generated in each of those years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the us in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2015 will be determined based on a variety of factors including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt dividend distributions and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries’ earnings to the us has historically occurred at yearend although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes in the us on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax we paid 107 million and 193 million in additional us federal income taxes in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years 

  

inventories at june 30 2014 increased by 196 million or 13 to 1654 million compared to june 30 2013 inventories of 1458 million the increase in inventories was due mainly to recent new product introductions and an increase in inventories held to support the increase in unit sales 

  

 43  

accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at june 30 2014 were 3596 million an increase of 412 million or 13 over the june 30 2013 accounts receivable balance of 3183 million accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 76 days at june 30 2014 increased by 11 days compared to 65 days at june 30 2013 the increase in our accounts receivable balance and days sales is mainly due to longer payment terms in our domestic market our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30 2014 and 2013 was 30 and 30 respectively the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience 

  

during the year ended june 30 2014 we generated cash of 3913 million from operations this was slightly lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30 2013 of 4028 million which was primarily the result of the increase in our inventory balance movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30 2014 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by 307 million as reported in us dollars during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 44 million and 43 million shares at a cost of 2081 million and 1880 million respectively during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 we also paid dividends totaling 1415 million and 972 million respectively 

  

details of contractual obligations at june 30 2014 are as follows 

  



  

details of other commercial commitments at june 30 2014 are as follows 

  



  

 the above guarantees mainly relate to requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our german subsidiaries and guarantees provided under our facility leasing obligations 

  

credit facility 

  

on october 31 2013 we entered into a credit agreement as borrower with lenders including union bank na as administrative agent joint lead arranger swing line lender and letters of credit issuer and hsbc bank usa national association as syndication agent and joint lead arranger our obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by resmed corp and resmed motor technologies inc two of our us subsidiaries 

  

the credit agreement provides a 700 million senior unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with an uncommitted option to increase the credit facility by an additional 300 million the credit facility also includes a 25 million sublimit for letters of credit the credit facility terminates on october 31 2018 when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid the outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor 

  

 44  

plus 10 to 20 depending on the thenapplicable leverage ratio at june 30 2014 the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 12 an applicable commitment fee of 015 to 025 depending on the thenapplicable leverage ratio applies on the unused portion of the credit facility 

  

when we entered into the credit agreement we used a portion of the proceeds from the initial funding of the credit facility to repay the outstanding balance under our previous revolving credit facility with union bank na and other lenders on that repayment the previous credit agreement dated as of february 10 2011 between us and lenders including union bank na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer hsbc bank usa national association as syndication agent and union bank na hsbc bank usa national association commonwealth bank of australia and wells fargo bank was terminated and the commitments under the previous credit agreement were also terminated 

  

our obligations under the current credit agreement are unsecured but are guaranteed by two of our us subsidiaries the credit agreement contains customary covenants including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and an interest coverage ratio the entire principal amount of the credit facility and any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs as defined in the credit agreement events of default under the credit agreement include failure to make payments when due the occurrence of a default in the performance of any covenants in the credit agreement or related documents or certain changes of control of resmed inc resmed corp resmed motor technologies inc resmed limited resmed holdings ltdllc or resmed eap holdings llc 

  

at june 30 2014 we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was 3000 million outstanding under the credit agreement 

  

we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand cash generated from operations and debt facilities 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 20 and approximately 23 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend on numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax credit is available the level of foreign earnings repatriated to the us the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws including the lower statutory tax rates and other incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

 45  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns depends on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2014 using a quantitative assessment the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value 

  

4 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date where we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense could have a material effect on our operating results 

  

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with 

  

 46  

uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws although currently immaterial we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 

  

6 revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment which is when title transfers to the customer we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue 

  

we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders onetime special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation cost of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is 

  

 47  

placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we use historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the blackscholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to during the vesting period we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units or prsus which contain a market condition using a montecarlo simulation valuation model

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

we employ approximately 3900 people and sell our products in approximately 100 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

our web site address is wwwresmedcom we make our periodic reports together with any amendments available on our web site free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the securities and exchange commission or sec information contained on the website is not part of or incorporated into the annual report 

  

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 and sold cpap devices in australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including distributors suppliers and developers of medical equipment 

  

segment information 

  

we believe that given the single market focus of our operations solely in the sleepdisordered breathing sector of the respiratory medicine industry and the interdependence of its products we operate as a single operating segment see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa 

  

 3  

typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

a 2013 epidemiology study estimated that 26 of adults age 3070 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 46 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with congestive heart failure 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the 

  

 4  

soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty and nasal devices alternative treatments reported to be under development include pharmaceutical therapies and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles 

  

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sdb more effectively increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 2011 we introduced the s9 bilevel range of flow generators the quattro fx full face mask the swift fx for her nasal pillow mask the mirage fx nasal mask the mirage fx for her nasal mask and the stellar ventilation device in 2012 we introduced swift™ fx bella mask pixi™ pediatric mask quattro fx for her and the easycare compliance management solution in 2013 we introduced new products across both our mask and flow generator categories including the vpap copd quattro air swift fx bella swift fx nano and resmed’s sleepseeker we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing 

  

 5  

success approximately 15 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2013 we invested 1201 million or approximately 8 of our net revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in approximately 100 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and thirdparty payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target both the population with predisposition to sdb and medical specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation in concert with other industry participants we sponsor educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sdb or osa and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation which utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable 

  

 6  

bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa 

  

with the acquisition of resmed paris sas previously saime sa in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices complement our vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance during fiscal year 2011 we also launched the stellar 100 and 150 ventilation devices which provide both invasive and noninvasive ventilation applications for adult and pediatric patients 

  

flow generators in total accounted for approximately 54 54 and 56 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively

mask systems and diagnostic products 

  

mask systems are one of the most important elements of sdb treatment systems masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy we have been a consistent innovator in masks improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight 

  



  

 10  



  

we market sleep recorders for the diagnosis and titration of sdb in sleep clinics and hospitals these diagnostic systems record relevant respiratory and sleep data which can be analyzed by a sleep specialist or physician who can then tailor an appropriate osa treatment regimen for the patient 

  



  

 11  

accessories and other products 

  

to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as easycare reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as h5i and h4i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient helping to prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits 

  

   

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke 

  

 12  

congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in many countries including the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland china and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors customers and patients 

  

in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 we invested 1201 million 1097 million and 920 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in approximately 100 countries through a network of distributors and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 15 – segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in north and latin america our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the north and latin america 

  

we also market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 56 55 and 53 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany norway netherlands sweden switzerland the united kingdom and ireland we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from thirdparty payers 

  

sales in europe accounted for 33 35 and 37 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have whollyowned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan new zealand china and india we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific sales in asia pacific accounted for 11 10 and 10 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

 13  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke clinical research over the past decade has demonstrated a high prevalence of osa in cardiology patients and has suggested that it may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and heart failure in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in 2013 the american college of cardiology foundation and the american heart association issued guidelines for the management of heart failure those guidelines recognized that cpap can be beneficial to improve functional status in patients with heart failure and sleep apnea we are conducting several clinical studies investigating the role of osa in cardiology diseases and are engaged with professional bodies to increase awareness of osa amongst cardiologists 

  

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes and there is preliminary evidence that osa may worsen diabetes control accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our online partners resmed is educating people who suffer from diabetes about the overlap with obstructive sleep apnea and directing them via wwwhealthysleepcom to resmed partner sleep centers 

  

in june 2008 the international diabetes federation or idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes recommending screening for osasdb in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years 

  

in april 2010 the national institutes of health released a clinical study reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middleaged and older adults especially men in a recently released study in circulation it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middleaged and older men specifically men ages 40 to 70 with an apneahypopnea index or ahi of equal to or greater than 30 were 68 more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi of less than 5 

  

we are working with the anesthesiology community to help reduce the potential for perioperative deaths due to undiagnosed sleepdisordered breathing in patients undergoing surgical procedures we continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties 

  

we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets including diabetes and cardiology

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility we have a 174000 square foot assembly and distribution facility in south carolina the plant specializes in regional customization of our flow generators we have a 95000 square foot manufacturing facility in singapore to complement the sydney manufacturing site the plant assembles masks flow generators and electric motors we have a 46000 square foot manufacturing facility in malaysia the plant specializes in the manufacture of headgear material for our masks and accessories we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france the facility is primarily responsible for the assembly of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in freudenstadt germany the plant specializes in the manufacture of medical humidification products we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at a 72000 square foot manufacturing facility in chatsworth california 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell all of our manufacturing sites are accredited to iso 13485 these sites are subject to thirdparty audits conducted by the iso notified bodies at regular intervals 

  

thirdparty coverage and reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payers for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

the past decade of legislative reform in the united states including the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act 

  

 15  

collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma has significantly impacted reimbursement for products that we provide the longer term impact though not entirely predictable continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payer landscape 

  

beginning in 2005 the mma reduced payment amounts for five categories of hme froze payment amounts for certain covered home medical equipment hme items through 2007 established a medicare competitive acquisition program for hme and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers the dra capped the medicare rental period for certain capped rental items including cpap devices at 13 months of continuous use after which time title of the equipment would transfer automatically to the beneficiary mippa retroactively delayed the implementation of competitive bidding for eighteen months and decreased the 2009 medicare fee schedule payment amounts for hme by 95 for product categories included in competitive bidding because the annual update factor for 2010 was 00  the 2009 fee schedule payment rates remained effective for 2010 for 2011 the fee schedule amounts were reduced by 01 and for 2012 the fee schedule amounts were increased by 24 and for 2013 the fee schedule amounts were increased by 08 

  

effective january 1 2011 the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms implemented the first round of competitive bidding program in 9 competitive bidding areas or cbas and included home medical equipment such as oxygen and oxygen equipment cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in this first round of competitive bidding was approximately 32 overall and 34 for cpap and respiratory devices on january 30 2013 cms announced the single payment amounts for the second round which cover a total of 91 cbas for cpap and respiratory devices the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the second round was approximately 47 on a weighted average basis effective july 1 2013 

  

the ppaca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources includes among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products the ppaca also provides for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services and a requirement that by 2016 the competitive bidding process must be rolledout nationally or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices 

  

we cannot predict the impact that any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and 

  

 16  

distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal market the primary competitors for our products are philips bv devilbiss healthcare and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited our principal international competitors are also philips bv devilbiss and fisher  paykel healthcare plus apex medical corporation bmc medical co ltd as well as regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition some of our competitors such as weinmann geräte für medizin gmbh  co kg are affiliates of customers of ours which may make it difficult to compete with them finally our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

 17  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited resmed rd germany gmbh resmed motor technologies inc resmed sensor technologies limited resmed sas and resmed paris sas as of the date of this annual report we own or have licensed rights to approximately 743 issued united states patents including approximately 342 design patents and approximately 1199 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 449 pending united states patent applications including approximately 54 design patent applications approximately 844 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1172 registered foreign designs and 1 pending foreign design some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 124 united states patents and 185 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years there are 19 foreign patents due to expire in 2014 36 in 2015 5 in 2016 28 in 2017 and 97 in 2018 there are 7 united states patents due to expire in 2014 21 united states patents in 2015 7 united states patents in 2016 28 united states patents in 2017 and 61 united states patents in 2018 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

 18  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2013 we had approximately 3900 employees or fulltime consultants of which approximately 1500 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 600 in research and development and 1800 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1250 were located in australia 800 in north and latin america 1300 in europe and 550 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

 19  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these thirdparties 

  

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions into our operations and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 44 and 46 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 45 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

  

   

   

   

 20  

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

  

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our sales to or the collectability of receivables we have from those customers a recent development affecting reimbursement negatively stems from the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma which instructed the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms the agency responsible for administering the medicare program to establish and implement programs under which our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas cms recently rolled out the competitive bidding program in 9 cbas and included home medical equipment such as oxygen and oxygen equipment cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories on july 2 2010 cms announced the single payment amount – the amount paid to successful bidders –for the first round of the competitive bidding and began offering contracts to qualifying home health companies effective january 1 2011 the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in this first round of competitive bidding was approximately 32 overall and 34 for cpap and respiratory devices and became effective january 1 2011 on january 30 2013 cms announced the single payment amounts for the second round which cover a total of 91 cbas for cpap and respiratory devices the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in the second round was approximately 47 on a weighted average basis effective july 1 2013 by 2016 the competitive bidding process must either be rolledout nationally or cms must reduce medicare prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices we cannot predict at this time the full impact these changes and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition 

  

 21  

healthcare reform including recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in january 2011 the fda announced 25 specific action items it intends to take with respect to the 510k process the fda issued its recommendations and proposed action items in response to concerns from both within and outside of the fda about the 510k program although the fda has not detailed the specific modifications or clarifications that the fda intends to make to its guidance policies and regulations pertaining to the review and regulation of devices such as ours which seek and receive marketing clearance through the 510k process the fda’s announced action items signal that additional regulatory requirements are likely in particular the fda intends to issue a variety of draft guidance and regulations over the coming months which would among other things clarify when changes to a cleared medical device warrant a new 510k and which modifications would be eligible for a special 510k establish a unique device identification system and clarify the fda’s use and application of several key terms in the 510k review process these reforms when implemented could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

  

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states the ppaca makes changes that are expected to impact the medical device industry one of the principal purposes of the ppaca was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who were uninsured the ppaca requires adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the ppaca also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this includes new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs which includes the apnealink vpap tx certain respiratory care and dental sleep products the ppaca also includes among other things the expansion of the second round two of competitive bidding to a total of 91 cbas and as mentioned above by 2016 the process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices other ppaca provisions include demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payers for our products and decreased profits to us 

  

other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which among other things creates the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers including home healthcare companies of up to 2 per fiscal year on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 or the atra which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the budget control 

  

 22  

act of 2011 on march 1 2013 the president signed an executive order implementing sequestration and on april 1 2013 the 2 medicare payment reductions went into effect the atra also among other things reduced medicare payments to several providers including hospitals imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

  

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states 

  

the ppaca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the us antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

the recently enacted ppaca among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the ppaca provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill thirdparty payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

beginning in 2013 the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission as of august 1 2013 manufacturers are required to collect data and they will be required to submit their first data reports to cms by march 31 2014 and by the 90th day of each calendar year thereafter 

  

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing some states such as california massachusetts and vermont mandate implementation of compliance programs andor the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance andor reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company many run 

  

 23  

afoul of one or more of the requirements the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal or state regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process in january 2011 the fda announced twentyfive specific action items it intends to take with respect to the 510k process designed in part to provide greater transparency and certainty to the review process some of the changes that the fda has announced it intends to take may affect requirements related to which devices are eligible for section 510k clearance and which devices may be used as predicates in demonstrating substantial equivalence and the grounds and procedures under which the fda may rescind a section 510k clearance furthermore the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing more strict 

  

 24  

requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions specifically on july 9 2012 the fda safety and innovation act of 2012 was enacted which among other requirements obligates the fda to prepare a report for congress on the fda’s approach for determining when a new 510k will be required for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device after submitting this report the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination until then manufacturers may continue to adhere to the fda’s existing guidance on this topic when making a determination as to whether or not a new 510k is required for a change or modification to a device but the practical impact of the fda’s continuing scrutiny of these issues remains unclear these and other revisions to the fda’s 510k clearance process when fully implemented could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for 

  

 25  

our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to thirdparties could be required to obtain 

  

 26  

licenses from thirdparties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions any final assessment resulting from such audits could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by 

  

 27  

the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally some of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of their assets as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition investors may not be able to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts where most of these assets and persons reside 

  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the united states mortgage market a declining residential real estate market in the united states and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile commodity prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market in our efforts we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity 

  

there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry evidence continues to mount supporting the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction the following three recent studies support the role of sdb therapy for disease prevention improvement of quality of life and healthcare cost reduction 

  

   

   

   

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2013 we invested approximately 1201 million on research and development activities which represents approximately 8 of net revenues since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories during fiscal year 2013 we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories including the vpap copd quattro air swift fx bella swift fx nano and resmed’s sleepseeker the release of these products as well as the release of the s9 bilevel range of flow generators and stellar 100 and 150 ventilation devices in fiscal 2011 have all contributed to the increase in our net revenues for fiscal year 2013

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 15145 million from 13685 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 1459 million or 11 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately 151 million for the year ended june 30 2013 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2013 increased by 12 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 8516 million from 7490 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 1026 million or 14 we believe this increase primarily reflects growth in the overall sdb market and market share gains in the apap and bilevel flow generator segments 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 6628 million from 6195 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 434 million or 7 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements international sales for the year ended june 30 2013 increased by 9 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 we believe this increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sdb market 

  

net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30 2013 totaled 8235 million from 7366 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 12 including increases of 18 in north and latin america and 7 elsewhere net revenue from mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 6909 million an increase of 9 including increases of 11 in north and latin america and 7 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2013 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 we believe these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sdb market and market share gains in the apap and bilevel flow generator segments

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 9407 million from 8207 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 1199 million or 15 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 621 for the year ended june 30 2013 compared with the 600 for the year ended june 30 2012 the improvement in gross margins was primarily due to cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements and favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales partially offset by declines in our average selling prices 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 4308 million from 4026 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 282 million or 7 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2013 was 28 compared to 29 for the year ended june 30 2012 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to be around 28 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2013 to 1201 million from 1097 million for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 104 million or 9 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 8 for the year ended june 30 2013 compared to 8 for the year ended june 30 2012 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel consulting and contractor expenses and an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products we expect our future research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7 to 8 

  

education research and settlement charge during the year we agreed to pay the university of sydney 248 million to establish two perpetual academic chairs fund future research in the fields of sleep medicine and biomedical engineering and settle legal proceedings between us we have expensed the full amount of 248 million 177 million net of tax in the current year within our operating expenses and we have separately disclosed the amount as an education research and settlement charge 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2013 totaled 101 million compared to 140 million for the year ended june 30 2012 the reduction in amortization expense is mainly attributable to certain acquired intangibles reaching the end of their useful life and therefore being fully amortized 

  

 37  

total other income net total other income net for the year ended june 30 2013 was 303 million a decrease of 72 million compared with 375 million for the year ended june 30 2012 the decrease in total other income net was due primarily to losses on foreign currency transactions partially offset by an increase in interest income due primarily to an increase in cash balances held 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 202 for the year ended june 30 2013 from 232 for the year ended june 30 2012 the lower effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of our taxable income including the lower statutory tax rates and other incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations 

  

net income as a result of the factors above and share repurchases our net income and earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2013 was 3071 million or 210 per diluted share compared to net income of 2549 million or 171 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2012 an increase of 21 and 23 respectively over the year ended june 30 2012

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 7490 million from 6622 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 868 million or 13 we believe this increase predominantly reflected growth in the overall sdb market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9 bilevel flow generators and the quattro fx mirage fx and mirage fx for her masks 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 6195 million from 5809 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 386 million or 7 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements international sales for the year ended june 30 2012 increased by 8 compared to the year ended june 30 2011 we believe this increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflected growth in the overall sdb market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9 bilevel flow generators and the quattro fx and mirage fx masks 

  

net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30 2012 totaled 7366 million from 6993 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 5 including increases of 6 in north and latin america and 5 elsewhere net revenue from mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 6319 million an increase of 16 including increases of 19 in north and latin america and 11 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2012 compared to the year ended june 30 2011 we believe these increases primarily reflected growth in the overall sdb market and contributions from new products

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 4026 million from 3722 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 304 million or 8 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2012 was 29 compared to 30 for the year ended june 30 2011 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 1097 million from 920 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 177 million or 19 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel and an increase in clinical trial costs the increase in research and development expenses was also due to the appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which increased our research and development expenses by approximately 25 million for the year ended june 30 2012 as reported in us dollars we expect our future research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2012 totaled 140 million compared to 101 million for the year ended june 30 2011 the increase in amortization expense was attributable to our recent acquisitions of biancamed limited and gruendler gmbh in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2012 was 375 million an increase of 08 million over 368 million for the year ended june 30 2011 the increase in other income net was due to an increase in interest income due primarily to an increase in cash balances held partially offset by lower gains on foreign currency and hedging transactions and an increase in interest expense due to an increase in borrowings 

  

 39  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 232 for the year ended june 30 2012 from 253 for the year ended june 30 2011 the lower tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above and share repurchases our net income for the year ended june 30 2012 was 2549 million or 171 per diluted share compared to net income of 2270 million or 144 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 12 and 19 respectively over the year ended june 30 2011 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of june 30 2013 and june 30 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of 8760 million and 8095 million respectively working capital was 8748 million and 11083 million at june 30 2013 and june 30 2012 respectively the reduction in working capital balance is due to reclassification of our longterm debt balance of 3000 million as a current liability in the june 2013 quarter as the facility terminates in february 2014 

  

as of june 30 2013 and june 30 2012 our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to 382 million and 617 million respectively our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30 2013 and june 30 2012 of 8378 million and 7478 million respectively were held by our nonus subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions 

  

as of june 30 2013 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 16 billion and those undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested we intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations we reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently if these earnings had not been permanently reinvested deferred taxes of approximately 409 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

  

we repatriated 185 million and 77 million to the us in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively from earnings generated in each of those years the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the us in the past has been determined and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2014 will be determined based on a variety of factors including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the us such as for the repayment of debt dividend distributions and other domestic obligations the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries’ earnings to the us has historically occurred at yearend although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs when we repatriate funds to the us we are required to pay taxes in the us on these amounts based on applicable us tax rates net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against us income tax we paid 193 million and 25 million in additional us federal income taxes in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years we do not currently expect the amount of repatriated foreign earnings or the resulting additional tax expense in 2014 to differ materially from the prior fiscal year 

  

inventories at june 30 2013 decreased by 285 million or 16 to 1458 million compared to june 30 2012 inventories of 1744 million the decrease in inventories was due mainly to improved inventory management and the depreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar 

  

 40  

accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at june 30 2013 were 3183 million an increase of 352 million or 12 over the june 30 2012 accounts receivable balance of 2832 million the increase was slightly higher than the 11 increase in net revenues for the year ended june 30 2013 compared to the year ended june 30 2012 due mainly to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 65 days at june 30 2013 decreased by 3 days compared to 68 days at june 30 2012 our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30 2013 and 2012 was 30 and 25 respectively the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience 

  

during the year ended june 30 2013 we generated cash of 4028 million from operations this was higher than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30 2012 of 3832 million and was primarily the result of the increase in our net revenues and net income movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30 2013 had the effect of lowering our cash and cash equivalents by 1044 million as reported in us dollars during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we repurchased 43 million and 136 million shares at a cost of 1880 million and 3912 million respectively during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we also paid dividends totaling 972 million and nil respectively

to 20 depending on the applicable leverage ratio or ii a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 05 to 10 depending on the applicable leverage ratio at june 30 2013 the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 17 commitment fees of 025 to 0375 depending on the applicable leverage ratio apply on the unused portion of the credit facility when we executed the credit agreement we used a portion of the credit facility’s initial funding proceeds to repay the outstanding balance under our previously existing revolving credit facility with union bank na which was then terminated 

  

our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a the corporate stock we hold in our subsidiaries resmed corp and resmed motor technologies inc “resmed motor” and b up to 65 of the ownership interests we hold in our subsidiary resmed eap holdings llc “resmed eap” our obligations under the credit agreement are also guaranteed by our subsidiaries resmed corp and resmed motor the credit agreement contains customary covenants including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum ratio of funded debt to ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement an interest coverage ratio and a maximum amount of annual capital expenditures the entire principal amount of the credit facility and any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable if an event of default occurs events of default include failure to make payments when due a default in the performance of any covenants in the credit agreement or related documents or certain changes of control of us or our subsidiaries resmed corp resmed motor resmed limited resmed holdings ltdllc or resmed eap 

  

on january 25 2012 we entered into a first amendment to the credit agreement the amendment increased from 300 million to 400 million the maximum principal amount that can be borrowed on a revolving basis under the credit agreement subject to customary conditions 

  

at june 30 2013 we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was 3000 million outstanding under the credit agreement as the credit facility terminates on february 10 2014 we have begun negotiating a new financing facility we expect that the new facility will have similar terms to the existing facility and that it will be in place before our existing facility expires 

  

we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand cash generated from operations and debt facilities 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 20 and approximately 25 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend on numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax credit is available the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws including the lower statutory tax rates and other incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns depends on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2013 using a quantitative assessment the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value 

  

4 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information 

  

 43  

available at the reporting date where we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense could have a material effect on our operating results 

  

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 

  

6 revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment which is when title transfers to the customer we do not record revenue on product sales that require customer acceptance until we receive acceptance we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue 

  

we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders onetime special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation cost of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period 

  

 44  

net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted under our employee stock purchase plan using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we use historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the blackscholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to during the vesting period we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units “prsus” which contain a market condition using a montecarlo simulation valuation model

interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt at june 30 2013 we maintained cash and cash equivalents of 8760 million principally comprised of bank term deposits and at call accounts and are invested at both shortterm fixed interest rates and variable interest rates at june 30 2013 we had total longterm debt including the current portion of those obligations of 3008 million of which 3000 million is subject to variable interest rates a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during the year ended june 30 2013 would not have had a material impact on pretax income we have no interest rate hedging agreements

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

we employ approximately 3700 people and sell our products in over 70 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including distributors suppliers and developers of medical equipment 

  

segment information 

  

we believe that given the single market focus of our operations solely in the sleepdisordered breathing sector of the respiratory medicine industry and the interdependence of its products we operate as a single operating segment see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa 

  

 3  

typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

it is estimated that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 40 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 20 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with congestive heart failure in relation to diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove 

  

 4  

excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty and nasal devices alternative treatments reported to be under development include pharmaceutical therapies and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles 

  

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered firstline therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a secondline option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat sdb more effectively increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 2009 we launched activa lt and the swift lt for her which was the first nasal pillow product released that is designed and marketed specifically for female patients in 2010 we launched the apnealink™ plus our type 3 device for home sleep testing the swift™ fx mask the mirage™ softgel mask and the s9 autoset and elite range of flow generator products in 2011 we introduced the s9 bilevel range of flow generators the quattro fx full face mask the swift fx for her nasal pillow mask the mirage fx nasal mask the mirage fx for her nasal mask and the stellar ventilation device in 2012 we introduced swift™ fx bella mask pixi™ 

  

 5  

pediatric mask quattro fx for her and the easycare compliance management solution we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 13 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2012 we invested 1097 million or 8 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 70 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and thirdparty payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target both the population with predisposition to sdb and medical specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation in concert with other industry participants we sponsor educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sdb or osa and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 we donated 10 million 10 million and 30 million respectively to the resmed foundation to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation which utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa 

  

with the acquisition of resmed paris sas previously saime sa in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices compliment our vpap iii vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance during the fiscal year 2011 we also launched the stellar 100 and 150 ventilation devices which provide both invasive and non invasive ventilation applications for adult and pediatric patients 

  

flow generators in total accounted for approximately 54 56 and 58 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively

masks accessories motors and diagnostic products 

  

masks accessories motors and diagnostic products together accounted for approximately 46 44 and 42 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

mask systems and diagnostic products 

  

mask systems are one of the most important elements of sdb treatment systems masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy we have been a consistent innovator in masks improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight 

  

   

 11  

   

 12  

we market sleep recorders for the diagnosis and titration of sdb in sleep clinics and hospitals these diagnostic systems record relevant respiratory and sleep data which can be analyzed by a sleep specialist or physician who can then tailor an appropriate osa treatment regimen for the patient 

  



  

accessories and other products 

  

to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as easycare reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as h5i and h4i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient helping to prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in many countries including the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland china and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors customers and patients 

  

in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 we invested 1097 million 920 million and 752 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 70 countries through a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 15 – segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in north and latin america our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the north and latin america 

  

we also market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare

dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 55 53 and 54 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany norway netherlands spain sweden switzerland the united kingdom and ireland we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from thirdparty payers 

  

sales in europe accounted for 35 37 and 37 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have whollyowned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan new zealand china and india we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific sales in asia pacific accounted for 10 10 and 9 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke clinical research over the past decade has demonstrated a high prevalence of osa in cardiology patients and has suggested that it may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and heart failure in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea we are conducting several clinical studies investigating the role of osa in cardiology diseases and are engaged with professional bodies to increase awareness of osa amongst cardiologists 

  

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes and there is preliminary evidence that osa may worsen diabetes control accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our online partners resmed is educating people who suffer from diabetes about the overlap with obstructive sleep apnea and directing them via wwwhealthysleepcom to resmed partner sleep centers 

  

in june 2008 the international diabetes federation or idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical 

  

 15  

symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes recommending screening for osasdb in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years 

  

in april 2010 the national institutes of health released a clinical study reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middleaged and older adults especially men in a recently released study in circulation it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middleaged and older men specifically men ages 40 to 70 with apneahypopnea index “ahi” ³ 30 were 68 more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi5 

  

we are working with the anesthesiology community to help reduce the potential for perioperative deaths due to undiagnosed sleepdisordered breathing in patients undergoing surgical procedures we continue to provide research funding in these strategic areas while at the same time providing educational support to physicians working within these various specialties 

  

we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets including diabetes and cardiology 

  

manufacturing 

  

our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility 

  

we have a 174000 square foot assembly and distribution facility in south carolina the plant specializes in regional customization of our flow generators 

  

we have a 69000 square foot manufacturing facility in singapore to complement the sydney manufacturing site the plant assembles masks flow generators and electric motors 

  

we have a 47000 square foot manufacturing facility in malaysia the plant specializes in the manufacture of headgear material for our masks and accessories 

  

we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france the facility is primarily responsible for the assembly of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

we have a 22000 square foot manufacturing facility in freudenstadt germany the plant specializes in the manufacture of medical humidification products 

  

we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at a 72000 square foot manufacturing facility in chatsworth california 

  

 16  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices the medical device directive 9342eec and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell all of our manufacturing sites are accredited to iso 13485 these sites are subject to thirdparty audits conducted by the iso notified bodies at regular intervals 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payers for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards costcontainment through managed healthcare or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

the past decade of legislative reform in the united states including the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma has significantly impacted reimbursement for products that we provide the longer term impact though not entirely predictable continues to bring significant changes to the thirdparty payer landscape 

  

beginning in 2005 the mma reduced payment amounts for five categories of hme froze payment amounts for certain covered home medical equipment hme items through 2007 established a medicare competitive acquisition program for hme and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers the dra capped the medicare rental period for certain capped rental items including cpap devices at 13 months of continuous use after which time title of the equipment would transfer automatically to the beneficiary mippa retroactively delayed the implementation of competitive bidding for eighteen months and decreased the 2009 medicare fee schedule payment amounts for hme by 95 percent for product categories included in competitive bidding because the annual update factor for 2010 was 0 percent the 2009 fee schedule payment rates remained effective for 2010 for 2011 the fee schedule amounts were reduced by 01 percent and for 2012 the fee schedule amounts were increased by 24 percent 

  

the ppaca which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources includes among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 percent of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 the ppaca also provides for a number of medicare regulatory requirements including new facetoface 

  

 17  

encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services and a requirement that by 2016 the competitive bidding process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices 

  

we cannot predict the impact that any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer either oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal market the primary competitors for our products are philips bv devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited our principal international competitors are also philips bv devilbiss apex medical corp and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited as well as regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdbrelated respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

 18  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited map medizintechnologie gmbh resmed motor technologies inc resmed sas and resmed paris sas we own or have licensed rights to approximately 640 issued united states patents including approximately 311 design patents and approximately 983 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 440 pending united states patent applications including approximately 55 design patent applications approximately 857 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1169 registered foreign designs and approximately 29 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 63 united states patents and 105 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years there are 8 foreign patents due to expire 2013 19 in 2014 40 in 2015 10 in 2016 and 28 in 2017 there are 2 united states patents due to expire in 2013 6 united states patents in 2014 19 united states patents in 2015 8 united states patents in 2016 and 28 united states patents in 2017 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

unless an exemption applies the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket 

  

 19  

notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2012 we had approximately 3700 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 1500 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 500 in research and development and 1700 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1200 were located in australia 800 in north and latin america 1200 in europe and 500 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by 

  

 20  

our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders as well as to nonsleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the nonsleep specialists most of whom use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions into our operations and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our 

  

 21  

management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 46 and 47 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these thirdparty payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not be subsequently reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing if at all 

  

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics reductions in reimbursement to our customers by thirdparty payers if they occur may have a material impact on our customers and therefore may indirectly affect our sales to or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers a recent development affecting reimbursement negatively stems from the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or mma which instructed the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms the agency responsible for administering the medicare program to establish and implement programs under which our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete 

  

 22  

to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas or cbas cms recently rolled out the competitive bidding program in 9 cbas and included home medical equipment such as oxygen and oxygen equipment cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories on july 2 2010 cms announced the single payment amount – the amount paid to successful bidders –for the first round of the competitive bidding and began offering contracts to qualifying home health companies effective january 1 2011 the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in this first round of competitive bidding was approximately 32 for cpap and respiratory devices and became effective january 1 2011 the expansion of the program for the second round covers a total of 91 cbas and is scheduled to be effective in the us summer of 2013 by 2016 the competitive bidding process must either be nationalized or cms must reduce medicare prices in noncompetitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices we cannot predict at this time what impact if any these changes to the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition 

  

healthcare reform including recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” was signed into law in the united states the ppaca makes changes that are expected to impact the medical device industry one of the principal purposes of the ppaca was to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who were uninsured the ppaca requires adults not covered by an employer or governmentsponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the ppaca also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions this includes new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 with limited exceptions entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices will be required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states though there are some exceptions to the excise tax this excise tax may apply to some or all of our products the ppaca also includes among other things the expansion of the second round two of competitive bidding to a total of 91 cbas and as mentioned above by 2016 the process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices other ppaca provisions include demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers such as physicians and hospitals and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in lower reimbursements by payers for our products and decreased profits to us 

  

a number of states challenged the constitutionality of the ppaca individual mandate and certain aspects of the legislation’s voluntary medicaid expansion criteria on june 28 2012 the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate and invalidated requirements that states forfeit significant federal funding if they do not expand medicaid coverage as prescribed by ppaca although the court left the remainder of its provisions intact congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives that may alter its implementation including possible repeal of ppaca in its entirety at this time it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to ppaca whether to certain provisions or its entirety 

  

in addition other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ppaca was enacted on august 2 2011 the president signed into law the budget control act of 2011 which

among other things creates the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress the joint select committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers including home healthcare companies of up to 2 per fiscal year starting in 2013 

  

in january 2011 the fda announced 25 specific action items it intends to take with respect to the 510k process the fda issued its recommendations and proposed action items in response to concerns from both within and outside of the fda about the 510k program although the fda has not detailed the specific modifications or clarifications that the fda intends to make to its guidance policies and regulations pertaining to the review and regulation of devices such as ours which seek and receive marketing clearance through the 510k process the fda’s announced action items signal that additional regulatory requirements are likely in particular the fda intends to issue a variety of draft guidance and regulations over the coming months which would among other things clarify when changes to a cleared medical device warrant a new 510k and which modifications would be eligible for a special 510k establish a unique device identification system and clarify the fda’s use and application of several key terms in the 510k review process these reforms when implemented could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

  

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states we cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us 

  

the ppaca as well as other federal andor state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future singularly or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the us antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

the recently enacted ppaca among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the ppaca provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill thirdparty payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

 24  

beginning in 2013 the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission on december 14 2011 cms released its proposed rule implementing these provisions providing further clarification to ambiguous or unclear statutory language and providing instructions for manufacturers to comply with such requirements cms closed its comment period on february 17 2012 and to date has not yet issued a final rule 

  

in addition there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing some states such as california massachusetts and vermont mandate implementation of compliance programs along with the tracking and reporting of gifts compensation and other remuneration to physicians the shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with difference compliance andor reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company many run afoul of one or more of the requirements the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal or state regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various us federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda other regulators or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k 

  

 25  

notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in the fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process in january 2011 the fda announced twentyfive specific action items it intends to take with respect to the 510k process designed in part to provide greater transparency and certainty to the review process some of the changes that the fda has announced it intends to take may affect requirements related to which devices are eligible for section 510k clearance and which devices may be used as predicates in demonstrating substantial equivalence and the grounds and procedures under which the fda may rescind a section 510k clearance furthermore the fda’s ongoing review of the 510k program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510k for a modification to a previously cleared product or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions specifically on july 9 2012 the fda safety and innovation act of 2012 was enacted which among other requirements obligates the fda to prepare a report for congress on the fda’s approach for determining when a new 510k will be required for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device after submitting this report the fda is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination until then manufacturers may continue to adhere to the fda’s existing guidance on this topic when making a determination as to whether or not a new 510k is required for a change or modification to a device but the practical impact of the fda’s continuing scrutiny of these issues remains unclear these and other revisions to the fda’s 510k clearance process when fully implemented could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to 

  

 26  

maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of thirdparties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be thirdparty patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

 27  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend thirdparty claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and timeconsuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions any final assessment resulting from such audits could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

 28  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally some our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of their assets as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition investors may not be able to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts where most of these assets and persons reside 

  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the united states mortgage market a declining residential real estate market in the united states and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile commodity prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability

overview 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc and subsidiaries it is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market in our efforts we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity 

  

in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes recommending that screening for sdbosa be done in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years the national institutes of health released a clinical study in april 2010 reporting that obstructive sleep apnea “osa” is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middleaged and older adults especially men in a recently released study in circulation it was reported that osa is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middleaged and older men specifically men ages 40 to 70 with ahi ³ 30 were 68 more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi5 in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes which recommended that screening for osa be done in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2012 we invested approximately 1097 million on research and development activities which represents 8 of net revenues since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories during fiscal year 2012 we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories we have introduced new masks during fiscal 2012 including the quattro fx for her swift fx bella and pixi pediatric mask additionally the release of s9 bilevel range of flow generators as well as stellar 100 and 150 ventilation devices in fiscal 2011 have all contributed to the increase in our net revenues for fiscal year 2012 

  

we reported record financial results in fiscal year 2012 with an increase in net revenue to 13685 million an increase of 10 when compared to fiscal year 2011 gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 8207 million from 7413 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 794 million or 11 our net income for the year ended june 30 2012 was 2549 million or 171 per diluted share compared to net income of 2270 million or 144 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2011 

  

total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2012 was 3832 million and at june 30 2012 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 8095 million our total assets increased by 3 to 21 billion and our shareholders’ equity was lower by 7 to 16 billion during fiscal year 2012 we repurchased 

  

 36  

136 million shares at a cost of 3912 million under our share buyback program compared to 49 million shares at a cost of 1601 million during fiscal year 2011 

  

in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis” which is in addition to the actual financial information presented in order to calculate our constant currency information we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period however constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to us dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2012 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2011 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 13685 million from 12431 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 1254 million or 10 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately 73 million for the year ended june 30 2012 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2012 increased by 11 compared to the year ended june 30 2011 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 7490 million from 6622 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 868 million or 13 we believe this increase predominantly reflects growth in the overall sdb market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9 bilevel flow generators and the quattro fx mirage fx and mirage fx for her masks 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 6195 million from 5809 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 386 million or 7 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements international sales for the year ended june 30 2012 increased by 8 compared to the year ended june 30 2011 we believe this increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sdb market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9 bilevel flow generators and the quattro fx and mirage fx masks 

  

net revenue from flow generators for the year ended june 30 2012 totaled 7366 million from 6993 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 5 including increases of 6 in north and latin america and 5 elsewhere net revenue from mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 6319 million an increase of 16 including increases of 19 in north and latin america and 11 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2012 compared to the year ended june 30 2011 we believe these primarily reflect growth in the overall sdb market and contributions from new products

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 8207 million from 7413 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 794 million or 11 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue remained at 60 for the year ended june 30 2012 which is consistent with the 60 for the year ended june 30 2011 gross margins were positively impacted by a favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales and cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements these impacts were offset by negative impacts associated with declines in our average selling prices and the appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of our manufacturing labor and overhead is denominated in australian dollars 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 4016 million from 3712 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 304 million or 8 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2012 was 29 compared to 30 for the year ended june 30 2011 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sdb as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue to be broadly in the range of 29 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2012 to 1097 million from 920 million for the year ended june 30 2011 an increase of 177 million or 19 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 8 for the year ended june 30 2012 compared to 7 for the year ended june 30 2011 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel and an increase in clinical trial costs the increase in research and development expenses was also due to the appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which increased our research and development expenses by approximately 25 million for the year ended june 30 2012 as reported in us dollars we expect our future research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8 

  

donations to research foundation in the years ended june 30 2012 and 2011 we donated 10 million and 10 million respectively to the resmed foundation the foundation was established primarily to promote research into the deleterious medical consequences of untreated sdb and to increase public and physician awareness of the importance of sleep and respiratory health throughout the world 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2012 totaled 140 million compared to 101 million for the year ended june 30 2011 the increase in amortization expense is attributable to our recent acquisitions of biancamed limited and gruendler gmbh in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2012 was 375 million an increase of 08 million over 368 million for the year ended june 30 2011 the increase in other income net was due to an increase in interest income due primarily to an increase in cash balances held partially offset by lower gains on foreign currency and hedging transactions and an increase in interest expense due to an increase in borrowings 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 232 for the year ended june 30 2012 from 253 for the year ended june 30 2011 the lower tax rate was primarily due to the geographic

mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2011 to 3712 million from 3289 million for the year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 424 million or 13 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2011 was 30 which is consistent to 30 for the year ended june 30 2010 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also due to the net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which increased our selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 88 million for the year ended june 30 2011 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue to be broadly in the range of 30

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 253 for the year ended june 30 2011 from 271 for the year ended june 30 2010 the lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia

we expect to satisfy all of our shortterm liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 23 and approximately 27 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend on numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax deduction is available the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in 

  

 43  

the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns depends on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2012 the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value 

  

 44  

4 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date where we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense could have a material effect on our operating results 

  

our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and adjust the income tax provision income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 

  

6 revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when title transfers to the customer we do not record revenue on product sales that require customer acceptance until we receive acceptance we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are excluded from revenue 

  

we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders onetime special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations 

  

 45  

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation cost of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we use historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

we employ approximately 3450 people and sell our products in over 70 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

our web site address is wwwresmedcom we make our periodic reports together with any amendments available on our web site free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the securities and exchange commission or sec information contained on the website is not part of or incorporated into the annual report 

  

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including distributors suppliers and developers of medical equipment 

  

segment information 

  

we believe that given the single market focus of our operations solely in the sleepdisordered breathing sector of the respiratory medicine industry and the interdependence of its products we operate as a single operating segment see note 15 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels 

  

 3  

increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

it is estimated that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 40 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 83 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes approximately 77 of patients with obesity and approximately 76 of patients with congestive heart failure in relation to diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3300 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for osa other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery mandibular advancement surgery dental appliances palatal implants somnoplasty and nasal devices alternative treatments reported to be under development include pharmaceutical therapies and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles 

  

a variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of osa most are only partially effective but cpap is a reliable treatment for all severities of osa and is considered first line therapy use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a second line option in patients unable to use cpap or those with mild osa these devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway cpap is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board and was commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance 

  

 5  

with prescribed therapy for example in 2007 we introduced the mirage quattro a full face mask that offers dualwall cushion with spring air technology which accommodates movement during sleep and the mirage liberty which combines our nasal pillow technology in a full face mask product with a minimalist design in 2008 we launched several new patient interfaces including the mirage micro a new generation nasal mask with a microfit dial and the swift lt which offers a pillow system for additional support and comfort in 2008 we also launched an updated version of our s8 flow generator and the vpap auto a new bilevel device incorporating our new motor technology including the easybreathe waveform in 2009 we launched activa lt and the swift lt for her which was the first nasal pillow product released that is designed and marketed specifically for female patients in 2010 we launched the apnealink™ plus our type 3 device for home sleep testing the swift™ fx mask the mirage™ softgel mask and the s9 autoset and elite range of flow generator products in 2011 we introduced the s9 bilevel range of flow generators the quattro fx full face mask the swift fx for her nasal pillow mask the mirage fx nasal mask themirage fx for her nasal mask and the stellar ventilation device we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 12 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2011 we invested 920 million or 7 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 70 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation in concert with other industry participants we sponsor educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sleepdisordered breathingobstructive sleep apnea and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we donated 10 million 30 million and 35 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation and was first made available to a select group of us key opinion leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 adapt sv utilizes an 

  

 6  

advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa 

  

with the acquisition of resmed paris sas previously saime sa in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices compliment our vpap iii vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance during the fiscal year 2011 we also launched the stellar 100 and 150 ventilation devices which provide both invasive and non invasive ventilation applications for adult and pediatric patients 

  

flow generators in total accounted for approximately 56 58 and 58 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively

mask systems and diagnostic products 

  

mask systems are one of the most important elements of sdb treatment systems masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy we have been a consistent innovator in masks improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight 

  

   

 11  

   

we market sleep recorders for the diagnosis and titration of sdb in sleep clinics and hospitals these diagnostic systems record relevant respiratory and sleep data which can be analyzed by a sleep specialist or physician who can then tailor an appropriate osa treatment regimen for the patient 

  

   

 12  

accessories and other products 

  

to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as h5i and h4i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient helping to prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits 

  



  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in many countries including the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland china and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors customers and patients 

  

in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we invested 920 million 752 million and 631 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 70 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in north and latin america our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the north and latin america 

  

we also market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 53 54 and 54 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany norway netherlands spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

sales in europe accounted for 37 37 and 38 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have whollyowned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan new zealand china and india we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific sales in asia pacific accounted for 10 9 and 8 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the importance of sdb in cardiology patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke clinical research over the past decade has demonstrated a high prevalence of osa in cardiology patients and has suggested that it may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and heart failure in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea we are conducting several clinical studies investigating the role of osa in cardiology diseases and are engaged with professional bodies to increase awareness of osa amongst cardiologists 

  

 14  

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes and there is preliminary evidence that osa may worsen diabetes control accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our online partners resmed is educating people who suffer from diabetes about the overlap with obstructive sleep apnea and directing them via wwwhealthysleepcom to resmed partner sleep centers 

  

in june 2008 the international diabetes federation idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes which recommended that screening be done in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years 

  

in april 2010 the national institutes of health released a clinical study reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middleaged and older adults especially men in a recently released study in circulation it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middleaged and older men specifically men ages 40 to 70 with apneahypopnea index “ahi” ³ 30 were 68 more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi5 

  

we believe that the increasing awareness among physicians supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets including diabetes and cardiology 

  

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

we have a 174000 square foot assembly and distribution facility in south carolina the plant specializes in regional customization of our flow generators 

  

we have a 69000 square foot manufacturing facility in singapore to complement the sydney manufacturing site the plant assembles masks flow generators and electric motors 

  

we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

  

 15  

we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at a 72000 square foot manufacturing facility in chatsworth california 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices and the medical device directive 9342eec our sydney south carolina and singapore facilities are each accredited to iso 9001 and iso 13485 these three sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed healthcare or legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as france germany and japan government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

recent legislation each of which has been signed into law including the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma contain provisions that negatively impact reimbursement for products that we provide 

  

the mma reduced payment amounts for five categories of hme beginning in 2005 froze payment amounts for certain covered home medical equipment hme items through 2007 established a competitive acquisition program for hme and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers the dra capped the medicare rental period for certain capped rental items including cpap devices at 13 months of continuous use after which time title of the equipment would transfer to the beneficiary mippa retroactively delayed the implementation of competitive bidding for eighteen months and decreased the 2009 fee schedule payment amounts by 95 percent for product categories included in competitive bidding because the annual update factor for 2010 was 0 percent the 2009 fee schedule payment rates remained effective for 2010 for 2011 the fee schedule amounts were reduced by 01 percent 

  

the ppaca includes among other things a deductible excise tax equal to 23 percent of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 new face to face encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services and a requirement that by 2016 the competitive bidding process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices

we cannot predict the impact that any us legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations while our product line in the united states does not include oxygen and oxygen related equipment reductions in reimbursement levels for oxygen could indirectly impact us 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal market the primary competitors for our products are philips bv who acquired respironics inc a previous competitor devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited our principal international competitors are also philips bv devilbiss and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited as well as regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

 17  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited map medizintechnologie gmbh resmed motor technologies inc and resmed paris sas we own or have licensed rights to approximately 550 issued united states patents including approximately 250 design patents and approximately 750 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 450 pending united states patent applications including approximately 100 design patent applications approximately 850 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1150 registered foreign designs and approximately 20 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 36 united states patents and 69 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with 6 foreign patents due to expire in 2012 6 in 2013 16 in 2014 33 in 2015 and 8 in 2016 and 3 united states patents in 2013 6 united states patents in 2014 19 united states patents in 2015 and 8 united states patents in 2016 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently 

  

 18  

marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2011 we had approximately 3450 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 1400 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 400 in research and development and 1650 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1350 were located in australia 800 in north and latin america 1000 in europe and 300 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete 

  

 19  

current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately the 3300 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home healthcare dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to market effectively our products outside the united states could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the united states in over 70 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments which may adversely impact our ability to market our products if we are unable to market effectively our products outside the united states our overall financial performance could decline 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and research and development costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively 

  

 20  

depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions into our operations and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 47 and 46 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales and operations outside of the us are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the us including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our nonus sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of our products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany 

  

 21  

government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing 

  

in the united states we do not submit claims and bill governmental programs or other third party payors directly for reimbursement for our products we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics any proposed reductions in reimbursement if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers for example in 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma instructed the centers for medicare  medicaid services the agency responsible for administering the medicare program cms to establish and implement programs under which competitive bidding areas “cbas” would be established throughout the united states for contract award purposes for the furnishing of competitively priced items of home medical equipment including oxygen and oxygen equipment cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories on july 2 2010 cms announced the single payment amount for round 1 of the competitive bidding which included 9 cbas and began offering contracts to certain bidders the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in this 1 st round of competitive bidding across the cbas for cpap and respiratory assist devices was approximately 32 effective january 1 2011 the expansion of round 2 of competitive bidding to a total of 91 cba’s is now scheduled to be effective in the us summer of 2013 and by 2016 the process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices we cannot predict at this time what impact if any these changes to the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition 

  

health care reform including recently enacted legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations   in march 2010 the us president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” which makes changes that are expected to impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries one of the principal aims of the ppaca as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who are currently uninsured we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the ppaca also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions among other things this includes new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 with limited exceptions entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices will be required to pay a deductible excise tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states though there are some exceptions to the excise tax this excise tax does apply to all of our products the ppaca also includes among other things the expansion of round 2 of competitive bidding to a total of 91 cba’s and by 2016 the process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research 

  

moreover in january 2011 the fda announced twentyfive specific action items it intends to take with respect to the 510k process fda issued its recommendations and proposed action items in response to concerns from both within and outside of fda about the 510k program although fda has not detailed the specific modifications or clarifications that the agency intends to make to its 

  

 22  

guidances policies and regulations pertaining to the review and regulation of devices such as ours which seek and receive marketing clearance through the 510k process the fda’s announced action items signal that additional regulatory requirements are likely in particular the fda intends to issue a variety of draft guidances and regulations over the coming months which would among other things clarify when changes to a cleared medical device warrant a new 510k and which modifications would be eligible for a special 510k establish a unique device identification system and clarify the fda’s use and application of several key terms in the 510k review process these reforms when implemented could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 

  

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states we cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us the taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion in the federal government’s role in the us healthcare industry and the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in decreased profits to us lower reimbursements by payors for our products and reduced medical procedure volumes a number of states have challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of ppaca and many of these challenges are still pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives including possible repeal of ppaca at this time it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to ppaca whether to certain provisions or its entirety the ppaca as well as other state andor federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the us antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

the recently enacted ppaca among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback and criminal health care fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the ppaca provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers effective march 30 2013 such information will be made publicly available in a searchable 

  

 23  

format beginning september 30 2013 in addition device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results for example in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been determined to have occurred the cost of this action was 628 million which accounted for factors such as the return of affected units unit replacement costs legal consulting logistical and temporary contractor expenses directly associated with the recall there is no remaining recall accrual for fiscal year 2011 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process in the 510k clearance process the fda must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market known as a “predicate” device with respect to intended use technology and safety and effectiveness in order to clear the proposed device for marketing the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510k clearance is not substantially equivalent or nse to a predicate device after a device receives 510k premarket notification clearance from the fda any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device technology materials packaging and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510k clearance or premarket approval we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products indeed recent trends in fda’s review of premarket notification submissions suggest that fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new more expansive or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510k submission this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process in january 2011 the fda announced twentyfive specific 

  

 24  

action items it intends to take with respect to the 510k process designed in part to provide greater transparency and certainty to the review process some of the changes that fda has announced it intends to take may affect requirements related to which devices are eligible for section 510k clearance and which devices which may be used as predicates in demonstrating substantial equivalence and the grounds and procedures under which fda may rescind a section 510k clearance similarly fda recently announced revised guidance on the types of modifications which require a manufacturer to submit a new 510k for the modified device these and other revisions to fda’s 510k clearance process when fully implemented could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new clearances increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to 

  

 25  

manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been determined to have occurred however we would likely be subject to product liability claims should any of these devices malfunction resulting in injury to a patient or damage to property any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were 

  

 26  

adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by tax authorities in various juridictions any final assessment resulting from such audits could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market in our efforts we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity 

  

in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes which recommended that screening be done in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years the national institutes of health released a clinical study in april 2010 reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middleaged and older adults especially men in a recently released study in circulation it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middleaged and older men specifically men ages 40 to 70 with ahi ³ 30 were 68 more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi5 in march 2011 the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes which recommended that screening for osa be done in adults with type 2 diabetes especially men older than 50 years there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry 

  

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2011 we invested approximately 920 million on research and development activities which represents 7 of net revenues since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories during fiscal year 2011 we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories we have introduced new masks during fiscal 2011 including the quattro fx mask and the mirage fx mask additionally we began releasing the s9 bilevel range of flow generators as well as stellar 100 and 150 ventilation devices these products have all contributed to the increase in our net revenues for fiscal year 2011

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2011 to 12431 million from 10924 million for the year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 1508 million or 14 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar positively impacted revenues by approximately 52 million for the year ended june 30 2011 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2011 increased by 13 compared to the year ended june 30 2010 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2011 to 6622 million from 5904 million for the year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 718 million or 12 we believe this increase predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9 flow generators and the quattro fx and mirage fx masks 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2011 to 5809 million from 5020 million for the year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 790 million or 16 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements international sales for the year ended june 30 2011 increased by 13 compared to the year ended june 30 2010 we believe this increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9 flow generators and the quattro fx and mirage fx masks 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2011 totaled 6993 million from 6336 million for the year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 10 including increases of 3 in north and latin america and 16 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 5439 million an increase of 19 including increases of 21 in north and latin america and 15 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2011 compared to the year ended june 30 2010 we believe these primarily reflect growth in the overall sdb market and contributions from new products

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also due to the net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which increased our selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 88 million for the year ended june 30 2011 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue to be broadly in the range of 30

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 253 for the year ended june 30 2011 from 271 for the year ended june 30 2010 the lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our new singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2011 was 2270 million or 144 per diluted share compared to net income of 1901 million or 123 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2010 an increase of 19 and 17 respectively over the year ended june 30 2010

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 25 and approximately 27 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend on numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax deduction is available the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 42  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns depends on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 

  

6 revenue recognition we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when title transfers to the customer we do not record revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance until we receive acceptance we record royalty revenue from license agreements when earned we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract we initially defer revenue 

  

 43  

we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract otherwise we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract we initially defer revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the contract we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers we charge all freightrelated expenses to cost of sales taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenueproducing transactions such as sales and value added taxes are reported on a net basis excluded from revenue 

  

we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims nor do we recognize revenues if we offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation therefore we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation cost of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we use historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

8 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

we employ approximately 3200 people and sell our products in over 70 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our americas asiapacific and european operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including 

  



  

on october 1 2009 we acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of laboratoires narval sa based in france laboratoires narval manufactures and distributes a mandibular repositioning device “mrd” that offers a solution to patients for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea “osa” especially for those with mild osa with this acquisition we add another therapy to supplement our existing positive airway pressurebased solutions providing a broader offering for this patient group

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 40 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes and approximately 80 of patients with congestive heart failure in relation to diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation 

  

 4  

syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway implanting a device to add support to the soft palate or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the 

  

 5  

repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal in 2005 we introduced the s8 range of cpap a small flow generator with optional integrated humidification in 2007 we introduced the mirage quattro a full face mask that offers dualwall cushion with spring air technology which accommodates movement during sleep and the mirage liberty which combines our nasal pillow technology in a full face mask product with a minimalist design in 2008 we launched several new patient interfaces including the mirage micro a new generation nasal mask with a microfit dial and the swift lt which offers a pillow system for additional support and comfort in 2008 we also launched an updated version of our s8 flow generator and the vpap auto a new bilevel device incorporating our new motor technology including the easybreathe waveform in 2009 we launched activa lt and the swift lt for her which was the first nasal pillow product released that is designed and marketed specifically for female patients in 2010 we launched the apnealink™ plus our type 3 device for home sleep testing the swift™ fx mask the mirage™ softgel mask and the s9 autoset and elite range of flow generator products we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 11 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2010 we invested 752 million or 7 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 70 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation in concert with another industry participant we are sponsoring educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sleepdisordered breathingobstructive sleep apnea and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity the programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry

during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we donated 30 million 35 million and 20 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation and was first made available to a select group of us key opinion leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 adapt sv utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators together accounted for approximately 58 58 and 50 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

with the acquisition of resmed paris sas previously saime sa in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are

masks accessories motors and diagnostic products 

  

masks accessories motors and diagnostic products together accounted for approximately 42 42 and 50 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

mask systems and diagnostic products 

  

mask systems are one of the most important elements of sdb treatment systems masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy we have been a consistent innovator in masks improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight 

  



  

 11  

we market sleep recorders for the diagnosis and titration of sdb in sleep clinics and hospitals these diagnostic systems record relevant respiratory and sleep data which can be analyzed by a sleep specialist or physician who can then tailor an appropriate osa treatment regimen for the patient 

  



  

accessories and other products 

  

to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire h2i and h3i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology in 2004 we launched our mirage swift mask a light and unobtrusive nasal pillows mask system also in 2004 we launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the united states only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea in 2006 we launched the adapt sv within the united states this product is for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing and uses a technology which we call adaptive servoventilation 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients typically our internal development staff then develops these ideas where appropriate into new products 

  

in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 we invested 752 million 631 million and 605 million respectively on research and development 

  

 13  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 70 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 16 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our us field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the united states 

  

we also market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 54 54 and 49 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany spain sweden norway netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

sales in europe accounted for 37 38 and 43 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have wholly–owned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan new zealand china and india we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific sales in asia pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 9 8 and 8 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue other suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the comorbidity of sdb in cardiovascular disease patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the 

  

 14  

diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our partnership with the american diabetes association a sleep laboratory is now present at every diabetes expo meeting where patients have the opportunity to learn about diabetes selfmanagement 

  

in june 2008 the international diabetes federation idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance 

  

in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea we believe that the increasing awareness among the comorbidity specialists supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets including diabetes and cardiology 

  

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

we have a 32000 square foot manufacturing facility in singapore to complement the sydney manufacturing site the plant commenced with the assembly of masks but now has a flow generator assembly line and an electric motor assembly line 

  

we have a 43000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at the resmed motor technologies inc facility which comprises a 72000 square foot facility at chatsworth california 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices and the medical device directive 9342eec our sydney australia and san diego california and singapore facilities are each accredited to iso 9001 and iso 13485 these three sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

legislation affecting reimbursement taxes 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these 

  

 15  

payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed healthcare or legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

recent united states legislation contains provisions that negatively impact reimbursement to our customers for their sale or rental of products that we provide these laws each of which has been signed into law include the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the ppaca medicare improvement for patients and providers act of 2008 mippa deficit reduction act of 2005 dra and the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma 

  

the mma reduced payment amounts for five categories of covered home medical equipment items beginning in 2005 froze payment amounts for certain items through 2007 established a competitive acquisition program and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for hme suppliers 

  

the dra capped the medicare rental period for certain capped rental items including cpap devices at 13 months of continuous use after which time title of the equipment would transfer to the beneficiary 

  

mippa retroactively delayed the implementation of competitive bidding for eighteen months and decreased the 2009 fee schedule payment amounts by 95 percent for product categories included in competitive bidding because the annual update factor for 2010 was 0 percent the 2009 fee schedule payment rates remain effective for 2010 

  

the ppaca among other things imposes a deductible excise tax equal to 23 percent of the price for which medical devices are sold in the united states on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices with limited exceptions beginning in 2013 new face to face encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services and a requirement that by 2016 the competitive bidding process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices 

  

we cannot predict the impact that any federal legislation enacted in the future will have on our revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations while our product line in the united states does not include oxygen and oxygen related equipment reductions in reimbursement levels for oxygen could indirectly impact us 

  

even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing 

  

 16  

remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home healthcare dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal market philips bv who acquired respironics inc a previous competitor devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc nellcor puritan bennett a division of covidien ltd and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited are the primary competitors for our products our principal international competitors are also philips bv devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

 17  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited map medizintechnologie gmbh resmed motor technologies inc and resmed paris sas we own or have licensed rights to approximately 450 issued united states patents including approximately 200 design patents and approximately 550 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 400 pending united states patent applications including approximately 80 design patent applications approximately 800 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1000 registered foreign designs and approximately 30 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 31 united states patents and 59 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with 18 foreign patents due to expire in 2011 11 in 2012 3 in 2013 5 in 2014 and 32 in 2015 and with 4 united states patents due to expire in 2011 2 united states patents in 2013 6 united states patents in 2014 and 19 united states patents in 2015 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others for example we are currently appealing the decision of a court in germany that entered judgment in favor of certain plaintiffs that had claimed they should be listed as coinventors on two of our german patent applications the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a 

  

 18  

considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2010 we had approximately 3200 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 1300 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 400 in research and development and 1500 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1300 were located in australia 700 in north and south america 1000 in europe and 200 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

during 200910 the bella vista campus continued its commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees contractors and visitors this commitment is underpinned by an ohs policy with its focus to systematically eliminate hazards and statement of objectives as guidance the occupational health and safety management system further integrated with the quality management system developing in maturity and ensuring compliance with local legislative requirements the introduction of positive performance indicators in 2009 continues to drive ohs continuous improvement and for the third consecutive year the bella vista campus has achieved a significant reduction in the rate of injury

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent 

  

 19  

product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately the 3000 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home healthcare dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to market effectively our products outside the united states could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the united states in over 70 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments which may adversely impact our ability to market our products if we are unable to market effectively our products outside the united states our overall financial performance could decline 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and research and development costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

 20  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer during the year ended june 30 2010 we acquired laboratories narval we continue to integrate this acquisition into our operations and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 46 and 46 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales 

  

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of the company’s products therefore even if a product is approved for 

  

 21  

marketing we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing 

  

in the united states we do not submit claims and bill governmental programs or other third party payors directly for reimbursement for our products we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers hospitals and to sleep clinics any proposed reductions in reimbursement if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers for example in 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma instructed the centers for medicare  medicaid services the agency responsible for administering the medicare program cms to establish and implement programs under which competitive bidding areas “cbas” would be established throughout the united states for contract award purposes for the furnishing of competitively priced items of home medical equipment including oxygen and oxygen equipment cpap and respiratory assist devices and related supplies and accessories on july 2 2010 cms announced the single payment amount for round 1 of the competitive bidding which included 9 cbas and began offering contracts to certain bidders the average reduction from current medicare payment rates in this 1 st round of competitive bidding across the cbas for cpap and respiratory assist devices is approximately 32 if implemented the proposed changes would be effective january 1 2011 the expansion of round 2 of competitive bidding to a total of 91 cba’s if implemented would be effective january 1 2013 and by 2016 the process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices we cannot predict at this time which proposals cms will adopt and what impact if any they will have on our business and financial condition 

  

health care reform including recently enacted united states legislation may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations   in march 2010 the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively the “ppaca” which makes changes that are expected to impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries one of the principal aims of the ppaca as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million americans who are currently uninsured we cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions if any on the sales of our products 

  

the ppaca also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions among other things this includes new fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 with limited exceptions entities that manufacture produce or import medical devices will be required to pay a deductible excise tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states though there are some exceptions to the excise tax this excise tax does apply to all of the company’s products the ppaca also includes among other things the expansion of round 2 of competitive bidding to a total of 91 cba’s and by 2016 the process must be nationalized or prices in noncompetitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices and the establishment of a new patientcentered outcomes research institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research

various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level in the united states we cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us the taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion in the federal government’s role in the us healthcare industry and the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits clinical outcomes effectiveness and appropriateness of products may result in decreased profits to us lower reimbursements by payors for our products and reduced medical procedure volumes the ppaca as well as other state andor federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us 

  

the recently enacted ppaca among other things amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback and criminal health care fraud statutes a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in addition the ppaca provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers effective march 30 2013 such information will be made publicly available in a searchable format beginning september 30 2013 in addition device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of 150000 per year and up to an aggregate of 1 million per year for “knowing failures” for all payments transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect 

  

 23  

our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results for example in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported the cost of this action was 628 million which accounted for factors such as the return of affected units unit replacement costs legal consulting logistical and temporary contractor expenses directly associated with the recall there is no remaining recall accrual for fiscal year 2010 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products in addition the fda is currently evaluating the section 510k clearance process and may make substantial changes to the process and associated industry requirements including the requirements related to which devices are eligible for section 510k clearance and which devices which may be used as predicates in demonstrating substantial equivalence and the grounds and procedures under which fda may rescind a section 510k clearance the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process andor significant changes to the section 510k clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation “qsr” requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing 

  

 24  

shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported however we would likely be subject to product liability claims should any of these devices malfunction resulting in injury to a patient or damage to property any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no 

  

 25  

consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing german tax audit any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 26  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

we may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally two of our eight directors and three of our six executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts 

  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the united states mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability

management’s discussion and analysis “mda” of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included herein 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market in our efforts we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes 

  

in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in june 2008 the international diabetes federation issued a consensus statement on sleep disordered breathing and type 2 diabetes where the substantial value of identifying and treating diabetic patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing was recognized and recommended the national institutes of health released a clinical study in april 2010 reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middleaged and older adults especially men in a recently released study in circulation it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middleaged and older men specifically men ages 40 to 70 with ahi ³ 30 were 68 more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi5 this is just one of many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea can improve health quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety especially in the transport industry we may experience continued growth from the increasing awareness of the relationship between sleepdisordered breathing obstructive sleep apnea and comorbidities such as cardiac disease diabetes hypertension and obesity 

  

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2010 we invested approximately 752 million on research and development activities which represents 7 of revenue since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

during fiscal year 2010 we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories we have introduced new masks during fiscal 2010 including the swift™ fx mask and the mirage™ softgel mask additionally we released the s9™ autoset and elite flow generators these products have an improved comfort and sleek bedroomfriendly design but most importantly have been developed to drive greater patient adherence to therapy 

  

we reported record financial results in fiscal year 2010 with an increase in net revenue of 19 to 10924 million compared to fiscal year 2009 gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 6555 million from 5538 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 1017 million or 18 our net income for the year ended june 30 2010 was 1901 million or 245 per diluted share compared to net income of 1464 million or 190 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2009 

  

 34  

total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2010 was 1882 million and at june 30 2010 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 4888 million our total assets increased by 9 to 16 billion and our shareholders’ equity was up 15 to 13 billion during fiscal year 2010 we repurchased 2519843 shares at a cost of 1358 million under our share buyback program 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2009 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 10924 million from 9207 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 1716 million or 19 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar positively impacted revenues by approximately 118 million for the year ended june 30 2010 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2010 increased by 17 compared to the year ended june 30 2009 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 5904 million from 4934 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 970 million or 20 we believe this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sdb and from our recent product releases including the s9™ autoset and elite flow generators and the swift™ fx and mirage™ softgel masks 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 5020 million from 4273 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 746 million or 17 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements international sales grew by 15 this sales growth outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s9™ autoset and elite flow generators and the swift™ fx and mirage™ softgel masks 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2010 totaled 6336 million from 5321 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 19 including increases of 18 in north and latin america and 20 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 4588 million an increase of 18 including increases of 22 in north and latin america and 12 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2010 compared to the year ended june 30 2009 we believe these primarily reflect growth in the overall sdb market and contributions from new products 

  

the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue for the year ended june 30 2010 compared to the year ended june 30 2009 

  



  

 constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements in international currencies 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 6555 million from 5538 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 1017 million or 18 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue remained at 60 for the year ended june 30 2010 which is consistent with the 60 for the year ended june 30 2009 gross margins were positively impacted by a favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales and cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements these impacts 

  

 35  

were offset by negative impacts associated with declines in our average selling prices and the appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of our manufacturing labor and overhead is denominated in australian dollars 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 3289 million from 2899 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 390 million or 13 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2010 was 30 compared to 31 for the year ended june 30 2009 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth stockbased compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also due to the net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which increased our selling general and administrative expenses by approximately 97 million for the year ended june 30 2010 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue to be broadly in the range of 30 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2010 to 752 million from 631 million for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 121 million or 19 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 7 for the year ended june 30 2010 and are consistent with the year ended june 30 2009 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in clinical trial costs the increase in research and development expenses was also due to the net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which increased our research and development expenses by approximately 87 million for the year ended june 30 2010 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future research and development expense to continue to be broadly in the range of 7 

  

donations to research foundation in the years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 we donated 30 million and 35 million respectively to the resmed foundation the foundation was established primarily to promote research into the deleterious medical consequences of untreated sleepdisordered breathing and to increase public and physician awareness of the importance of sleep and respiratory health throughout the world 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2010 totaled 80 million compared to 71 million for the year ended june 30 2009 the increase in amortization expense is attributable to the acquisition of laboratories narval sa and the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in euros 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2010 was 202 million a increase of 88 million over the year ended june 30 2009 of 114 million the increase in other income net was predominately due to gains on foreign currency and hedging transactions and an increase in interest income net due to additional cash balances and a reduction in our longterm debt 

  

 36  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 271 for the year ended june 30 2010 from 274 for the year ended june 30 2009 the lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our new singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2010 was 1901 million or 245 per diluted share compared to net income of 1464 million or 190 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2009 an increase of 30 and 29 respectively over the year ended june 30 2009

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 9207 million from 8354 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 853 million or 10 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately 403 million for the year ended june 30 2009 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2009 increased by 15 compared to the year ended june 30 2008 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 4934 million from 4096 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 838 million or 20 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator vpap auto 25 vpap s swift lt nasal pillows mask and mirage quattro fullface mask 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 4273 million from 4258 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 15 million or 04 movements in international currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted international revenues by approximately 403 million for the year ended june 30 2009 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements international sales grew by 10 this sales growth outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator vpap s vpap st and mirage quattro fullface mask offset by the negative impact from movements of international currencies against the us dollar 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2009 totaled 5321 million from 4842 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 10 including increases of 21 in north and latin america and 2 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 3886 million an increase of 11 including increase of 20 in north and latin america offset by a decrease of 2 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2009 compared to the year ended june 30 2008 we believe these primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and contributions from new products partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements in sales outside of north and latin america 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 5538 million from 4938 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 601 million or 12 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 60 from 59 for the year ended june 30 2008 the increase in gross margins is primarily due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of our manufacturing labor and overhead is 

  

 37  

denominated in australian dollars a favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales and cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 2899 million from 2781 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 118 million or 4 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2009 was 31 compared to 33 for the year ended june 30 2008 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth stockbased compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also offset by the net appreciation of the us dollar against international currencies which reduced by approximately 218 million our expenses for the year ended june 30 2009 as reported in us dollars 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 631 million from 605 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 25 million or 4 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 7 for the year ended june 30 2009 and are consistent with the year ended june 30 2008 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in clinical trials including the servehf study the increase in research and development expenses was also offset by the net appreciation of the us dollar against international currencies which reduced our expenses by approximately 110 million for the year ended june 30 2009 as reported in us dollars 

  

donations to research foundation in the years ended june 30 2009 and 2008 we donated 35 million and 20 million respectively to the resmed foundation the foundation was established primarily to promote research into the deleterious medical consequences of untreated sleepdisordered breathing 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2009 totaled 71 million compared to 78 million for the year ended june 30 2008 the decrease in amortization expense is attributable to the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in euros 

  

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended june 30 2009 were nil compared to 24 million for the year ended june 30 2008 restructuring expenses in the prior year consisted of expenses associated with our decision to streamline european management including the closure of part of the european headquarters in basel switzerland and two regional offices in the netherlands the restructuring expenses mainly comprise employee termination costs leasehold improvement writedowns and property lease exit costs we will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies and cost savings 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2009 was 114 million a decrease of 35 million over the year ended june 30 2008 of 149 million this was predominantly due a 59 million gain on the sale of our poway property that was reported in year ended june 30 2008 which was partly offset by a 32 million impairment writedown of our at costmethod investments in the same fiscal year 

  

 38  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 274 for the year ended june 30 2009 from 301 for the year ended june 30 2008 the lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our new singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2009 was 1464 million or 190 per diluted share compared to net income of 1103 million or 140 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 33 and 36 respectively over the year ended june 30 2008 

  

liquidity and capital resources

inventories at june 30 2010 increased by 282 million or 18 to 1856 million compared to june 30 2009 inventories of 1574 million the increase in inventories was lower than the increase of 19 in net revenues in the year ended june 30 2010 compared to the year ended june 30 2009 due to improved inventory management 

  

accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at june 30 2010 were 2269 million an increase of 148 million or 7 over the june 30 2009 accounts receivable balance of 2121 million the increase was lower than the 19 incremental increase in net revenues for the year ended june 30 2010 compared to the year ended june 30 2009 accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 71 days at june 30 2010 decreased by 3 days compared to 74 days at june 30 2009 our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30 2010 and 2009 was 33 and 34 respectively the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience 

  

during the year ended june 30 2010 we generated cash of 1882 million from operations this was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30 2009 of 2389 million and was primarily the result of an increase in income tax payments movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30 2010 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by 44 million as reported in us dollars during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 we repurchased 2519843 and 1826307 shares at a cost of 1358 million and 657 million respectively 

  

capital expenditures for the years ended june 30 2010 and 2009 aggregated 569 million and 1097 million respectively the capital expenditures for the year ended june 30 2010 primarily reflected computer hardware and software rental and loan equipment and purchase of production tooling equipment and machinery as a result of these capital expenditures our balance sheet reflects net property plant and equipment of approximately 3871 million at june 30 2010 compared to 3776 million at june 30 2009

we expect to satisfy all of our shortterm liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

  

stockbased compensation costs 

  

we have granted stock options and restricted stock units to personnel including officers and directors under the resmed inc 2009 incentive award plan the “2009 plan” the 2006 incentive award plan 

  

 42  

as amended the “2006 plan” and the amended and restated resmed inc 2006 incentive award plan the “2006 amended plan” these options and restricted stock units have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over one or four years we granted the options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant we have also offered to our personnel including officers the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under the resmed inc 2009 employee stock purchase plan the “espp” 

  

we measure the compensation expense of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model such value is recognized as expense over the service period using the straightline method for stockbased awards the fair value of restricted stock units is equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant 

  

the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under the espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model assuming no dividends and using the following assumptions 

  



  

expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from traded options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as we believe the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends while there is a tradable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 27 and approximately 30 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a an additional australian tax deduction is available the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

 43  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory adjustments warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

 44  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from rental unit contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation we measure the compensation of all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon us treasury yield curve appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we have used historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to 

  

 45  

these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

8 income tax we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2009 the fasb amended the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements this new guidance permits prospective or retrospective adoption we will prospectively adopt this guidance from july 1 2010 and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fairvalue measurements including significant transfers into and out of level 1 and level 2 fairvalue measurements and information on purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level 3 fairvalue measurements the fasb also clarified existing fairvalue measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation inputs and valuation techniques the guidance related to the level 3 reconciliation will be effective for the company beginning july 1 2011 the remaining guidance has been adopted and the impact was not material to the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial disclosures

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

 2  

we employ approximately 2900 people and sell our products in over 70 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors 

  

our web site address is wwwresmedcom we make our periodic reports together with any amendments available on our web site free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the securities and exchange commission 

  

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our americas asiapacific and european operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange now known as the australian securities exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 40 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases recent studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes and approximately 80 of patients with congestive heart failure in relation to diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration 

  

 4  

depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway implanting a device to add support to the soft palate or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow 

  

 5  

generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal in 2002 we introduced the autoset spirit flow generator our secondgeneration autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat osa in 2003 we introduced the mirage activa nasal mask with active cushion technology in 2004 we introduced the mirage swift nasal pillows system a less obtrusive lightweight and flexible alternative to nasal masks in 2005 we introduced the s8 range of cpap a small flow generator with optional integrated humidification in 2007 we introduced the mirage quattro a full face mask that offers dualwall cushion with spring air technology which accommodates movement during sleep and the mirage liberty which combines our nasal pillow technology in a full face mask product with a minimalist design in 2008 we launched several new patient interfaces including the mirage micro a new generation nasal mask with a microfit dial and the swift lt which offers a pillow system for additional support and comfort in 2008 we also launched an updated version of our s8 flow generator and the vpap auto a new bilevel device incorporating our new motor technology including the easybreathe waveform in 2009 we launched activa lt and the swift lt for her which was the first nasal pillow product released that is designed and marketed specifically for female patients we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 11 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2009 we invested 631 million or 7 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 70 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation 

  

during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we donated 35 million 20 million and nil respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

 6  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs recent studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation and was first made available to a select group of us key opinion leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 adapt sv utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators accounted for approximately 58 50 and 52 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

with the acquisition of saime sas in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices compliment our vpap iii vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance

accessories and other products 

  

to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire h2i and h3i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits 

  



  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology in 2004 we launched our mirage swift mask a light and unobtrusive 

  

 13  

nasal pillows mask system also in 2004 we launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the united states only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea in 2006 we launched the adapt sv within the united states this product is for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing and uses a technology which we call adaptive servoventilation 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients typically our internal development staff then develops these ideas where appropriate into new products 

  

in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we invested 631 million 605 million and 501 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 70 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 16 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our us field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the united states 

  

we also market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 54 49 and 53 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany spain sweden norway netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine 

  

 14  

and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

sales in europe accounted for 38 43 and 39 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have wholly–owned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan new zealand singapore china and india we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific sales in asia pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 8 8 and 8 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue other suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the comorbidity of sdb in cardiovascular disease patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke 

  

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our partnership with the american diabetes association a sleep laboratory is now present at every diabetes expo meeting where patients have the opportunity to learn about diabetes selfmanagement 

  

in june 2008 the international diabetes federation idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance we also announced a comarketing agreement with lifescan a johnson and johnson company to increase the level of education and awareness of sdb in the diabetic population 

  

in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in june 2008 the international diabetes federation issued a consensus statement on sleep disordered breathing and type 2 diabetes where the substantial value of identifying and treating diabetic patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing was recognized and recommended we believe that the increasing awareness among the comorbidity specialists supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets including diabetes and cardiology 

  

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed healthcare or legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 act reduced medical reimbursement for respiratory drugs and home oxygen to homecare providers and placed a freeze on current reimbursement levels for durable medical equipment dme through 2008 as required by the 2003 act medicare plans to implement competitive bidding of durable medical equipment in 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas msa by the end of 2007 and in 80 of the largest msas by the end of 2009 in addition the us congress passed the deficit reduction act of 2005 2005 act in february 2006 which contained medicare payment reductions for home oxygen equipment and certain durable medical equipment classified by medicare as capped 

  

 16  

rental equipment in august 2006 the centers for medicare and medicaid services published a proposed regulation to implement the 2005 act which could reduce medicare reimbursement in 2007 for oxygen equipment additional reimbursement reductions for home oxygen were proposed in president bush’s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal and could also be enacted into law both the federal government and state legislatures are considering options for containing growth in the medicaid program 

  

even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home healthcare dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal market philips bv who acquired respironics inc a previous competitor devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc nellcor puritan bennett a division of covidien ltd and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited are the primary competitors for our products our principal european competitors are also philips devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related 

  

 17  

respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited map medizintechnologie gmbh resmed motor technologies inc and resmed paris sas we own or have licensed rights to approximately 400 issued united states patents including approximately 200 design patents and approximately 500 issued foreign patents in addition there are approximately 400 pending united states patent applications including approximately 80 design patent applications approximately 780 pending foreign patent applications approximately 1000 registered foreign designs and approximately 90 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 14 united states patents and 29 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with 2 foreign patents due to expire in 2010 18 in 2011 1 in 2012 3 in 2013 and 5 in 2014 and 2 united states patents in 2010 4 united states patents in 2011 2 united states patents in 2013 and 6 united states patents in 2014 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a 

  

 18  

premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2009 we had approximately 2900 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 1200 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 300 in research and development and 1400 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1200 were located in australia 600 in north and south america 900 in europe and 200 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of 

  

 19  

innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately the 3000 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home healthcare dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to market effectively our products outside the us could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us in over 70 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments which may adversely impact our ability to market our products if we are unable to market effectively our products outside the us our overall financial performance could decline 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and research and development costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations 

  

 20  

increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage effectively and efficiently our growth our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer during the past five fiscal years we have acquired respicure western medical marketing polarmed pulmomed saime hoefner and resprecare we continue to integrate these acquisitions into our operations the integration requires significant efforts from each company and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 46 and 51 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse patients for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of the company’s products therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate 

  

 21  

will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights may harm our business 

  

as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs or other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and medicare 

  

in addition to reimbursement for our products our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products any proposed reductions in reimbursement if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results for example in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported the initial estimated cost of this action was 597 million which was recognized as a charge to cost of sales in the consolidated 

  

 22  

statement of income year ended june 30 2007 during the year ended june 30 2009 and june 30 2008 we recognized additional charges of nil and 31 million these costs accounted for factors such as expected return rates for the affected units unit replacement costs legal consulting logistical and temporary contractor expenses directly associated with the recall we expect negligible additional costs associated with the recall and at june 30 2009 there is no remaining recall accrual 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer 

  

we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which we conduct business as a device manufacturer we are required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation “qsr” requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

 23  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 

  

a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported however we would likely be subject to product liability claims should any of these devices malfunction resulting in injury to a patient or damage to property any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

 24  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing german tax audit any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 25  

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 

  

additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

we may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally two of our eight directors and three of our six executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts 

  

our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally including conditions in the financial markets recently concerns over inflation energy costs geopolitical issues the availability and cost of credit the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward these factors combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate if the economic climate in the us or outside the us continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases which could impact our revenue our ability to manage inventory levels collect customer receivables and ultimately decrease our profitability

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sleepdisordered breathing and to grow our business in this market in our efforts we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes 

  

in september 2008 the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleeprelated disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure or cpap for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in june 2008 the international diabetes federation issued a consensus statement on sleep disordered breathing and type 2 diabetes where the substantial value of identifying and treating diabetic patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing was recognized and recommended we believe that the increasing awareness among the comorbidity specialists supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets including diabetes and cardiology 

  

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2009 we invested approximately 631 million on research and development activities which represents 7 of revenue since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

during fiscal year 2009 we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories we have introduced new masks in both europe and the us during fiscal 2009 including the release of activa lt and swift lt for her which was the first nasal pillows product designed and marketed specifically for female patients additionally we released a series of new bilevel flow generators in europe and in north and latin america these products utilize our patented easybreathe motor technology providing performance at substantially quieter noise levels compared to other leading competitors 

  

we reported record financial results in fiscal year 2009 with an increase in net revenue of 10 to 9207 million compared to fiscal year 2008 gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 5538 million from 4937 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 601 million or 12 our net income for the year ended june 30 2009 was 1464 million or 190 per diluted share compared to net income of 1103 million or 140 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2008

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 9207 million from 8354 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 853 million or 10 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately 403 million for the year ended june 30 2009 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2009 increased by 15 compared to the year ended june 30 2008 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 4934 million from 4096 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 838 million or 20 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator vpap auto 25 vpap s swift lt nasal pillows mask and mirage quattro fullface mask 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 4273 million from 4258 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 15 million or 04 excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements international sales grew by 10 this sales growth outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator vpap s vpap st and mirage quattro fullface mask offset by the negative impact from movements of international currencies against the us dollar 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2009 totaled 5321 million from 4185 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 10 including increases of 21 in north and latin america and 2 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 3886 million an increase of 11 including increase of 20 in north and latin america offset by a decrease of 2 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2009 compared to the year ended june 30 2008 we believe these primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and contributions from new products partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements in sales outside of north and latin america 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 5538 million from 4938 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 601 million or 12 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 60 from 59 for the year ended june 30 2008 the increase in gross margins is primarily due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of our manufacturing labor and overhead is denominated in australian dollars a favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales and cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 2899 million from 2781 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 118 million or 4 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2009 was 31 compared to 33 for the year ended june 30 2008 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth stockbased compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also offset by the net appreciation of the us dollar against international currencies which reduced by approximately 218 million our expenses for the year ended june 30 

  

 33  

2009 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 31 to 33 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2009 to 631 million from 605 million for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 25 million or 4 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 7 for the year ended june 30 2009 and are consistent with the year ended june 30 2008 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in clinical trials including the servehf study the increase in research and development expenses was also offset by the net appreciation of the us dollar against international currencies which reduced our expenses by approximately 110 million for the year ended june 30 2009 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future research and development expense to continue at approximately 7 

  

donations to foundations in the years ended june 30 2009 and 2008 we donated 35 million and 20 million respectively to the resmed foundations the foundations were established primarily to promote research into the deleterious medical consequences of untreated sleepdisordered breathing 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2009 totaled 71 million compared to 78 million for the year ended june 30 2008 the decrease in amortization expense is attributable to the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in euros

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2009 was 114 million a decrease of 35 million over the year ended june 30 2008 of 149 million this was predominantly due a 59 million gain on the sale of our poway property that was reported in year ended june 30 2008 which was partly offset by a 32 million impairment writedown of our at costmethod investments in the same fiscal year 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to 274 for the year ended june 30 2009 from 301 for the year ended june 30 2008 the lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income including the impact of lower taxes associated with our new singapore manufacturing operation we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2009 was 1464 million or 190 per diluted share compared to net income of 1103 million or 140 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2008 an increase of 33 and 36 respectively over the year ended june 30 2008

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 4096 million from 3767 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 329 million or 9 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator swift lt nasal pillows mask and mirage quattro fullface mask

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2008 totaled 4185 million an increase of 13 compared to the year ended june 30 2007 including increases of 3 in north and latin america and 20 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 4169 million an increase of 21 including increases of 13 in north and latin america and 35 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2008 compared to the year ended june 30 2007 we believe these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and contributions from new products 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 4938 million from 3845 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 1093 million or 28 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 59 from 54 for the year ended june 30 2007 the increase in gross margin is primarily due to 597 million of voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 during the year ended june 30 2008 we also recognized an additional charge of 31 million in relation to the product recall announced in 2007 due to higher than original estimated return rates and consulting charges excluding voluntary product recall expenses gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 59 for the year ended june 30 2008 which is lower than the year ended june 30 2007 of 62 the lower gross margin excluding the voluntary product recall expense is primarily due to a general reduction in average selling prices appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements 

  

voluntary product recall expenses on april 23 2007 we initiated a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 units of our early production s8 flow generators in these particular units which were manufactured between july 2004 and may 15 2006 there was what we considered to be a remote potential for a short circuit in the power supply connector the initial estimated cost of this recall action was 597 million which was recognized as a charge to cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of income during the year ended june 30 2007 during the year ended june 30 2008 we recognized an additional charge of 31 million due to the higher than original estimated return rates and consulting charges at june 30 2008 the recall accrual was 10 million

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2008 was 149 million an increase of 70 million over the year ended june 30 2007 this was predominantly due to higher interest income on additional cash balances and a 59 million gain on the sale of our poway property these impacts were partly offset by a 32 million impairment writedown of our at costmethod investments

stockbased compensation costs 

  

we have granted stock options to personnel including officers and directors under our 2006 incentive award plan as amended the “2006 plan” these options have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over four years we granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant we have also offered to our personnel including officers and directors the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” 

  

as of july 1 2005 we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest under this method the provisions of sfas 123r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption in addition the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption determined under the original provisions of sfas no 123 shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model such value is recognized as expense over the service period using the gradedattribution method for stockbased awards granted prior to july 1 2005 and the straightline method for stockbased awards granted after july 1 2005 

  

the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under our espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model assuming no dividends and the following assumptions 

  



  

expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to their expected term we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the additional use of the implied volatilities are more representative of our future stock price trends the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 27 and approximately 32 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances contingencies and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any 

  

 41  

identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force we do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such shipments our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no123r we measure the compensation of all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value 

  

 42  

of employee stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon us treasury yield curve appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we have used historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

8 income tax we have adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” on july 1 2007 in accordance with fin 48 we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in may 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 165 “subsequent events” “sfas no 165” sfas no 165 provides rules on recognition and disclosure for events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued in addition sfas no 165 requires a reporting entity to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements are issued or the date the financial statements are available to be issued sfas no 165 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june 15 2009 we have adopted sfas no 165 and have included the required additional disclosures 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities – an amendment of fasb statement 133” “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 requires disclosure of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cashflows sfas no 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after november 15 2008 we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” under the requirements of sfas no 141r the acquiring entity will be required to recognise all assets and liabilities acquired in a transaction at their acquisition date fair value sfas no 141r will also change the accounting treatment for specific transactions such as the recognition of contingent liabilities the recognition of capitalized inprocess research and development restructuring costs the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and changes in the income 

  

 43  

tax valuation allowances sfas no 141r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after july 1 2009 with early adoption prohibited the impact on our consolidated financial statements of sfas no 141r will depend on whether we engage in such activity and also upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions we may consummate after the effective date 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no51” “sfas no 160” sfas no 160 outlines the accounting and reporting requirements for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements such as recognizing noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholder’s equity separate from the parent equity and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests be identified and shown separately on the face of the consolidated income statement sfas no 160 also revises the accounting for increases and decreases in a parent’s controlling interest sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2008 with early adoption prohibited we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in june 2007 the fasb ratified eitf no 073 “accounting for nonrefundable advanced payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities” “eitf no 073” eitf no 073 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized these amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed eitf no 073 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 we have adopted this standard and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in february 2007 fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” which allows entities to account for most financial instruments at fair value rather than under other applicable generally accepted accounting principles gaap such as historical cost the accounting results in the instrument being marked to fair value every reporting period with the gain or loss from a change in fair value recorded in the income statement sfas 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 based upon our analysis and implementation of sfas 159 as it relates to our balance sheet accounts we did not elect the fair value option permitted in sfas 159 for any of our eligible financial assets or liabilities therefore sfas 159 did not have any impact on our financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we have adopted this standard on july 1 2008 and all related staff positions the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements

interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt at june 30 2009 we had total longterm debt including the current portion of those obligations of 1617 million all of this debt is subject to variable interest rates a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during the year ended june 30 2009 would not have a material impact on pretax income we have no interest rate hedging agreements 

  

credit market risk 

  

at june 30 2009 our investment securities of 43 million were held in aaa rated auction securities with various maturities between july 2039 and november 2047 these investments had regular rollover or auction dates at which time the interest rates were reset or the investments were redeemed for cash during the year ended june 30 2009 there were no auctions with respect to these investments due to the current liquidity issues surrounding the domestic and global capital markets we continue to earn interest on these investments in accordance with the contract until the next auction occurs during november 2008 we accepted an offer from ubs financial services inc “ubs” that gave us a contractual right to sell our investment securities back to ubs at full par value after june 29 2010 however in the event we need to access the funds invested in these auction rate securities prior to june 29 2010 we may not be able to liquidate these securities at the par value therefore given the current market liquidity conditions and our intention to hold these investments until the rights under the ubs offer can be exercised on june 29 2010 we have reclassified these securities from current to noncurrent assets we also believe the current lack of liquidity of these investments is temporary and have therefore recorded the excess of the carrying value of 07 million over the fair value to accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity 

  

additionally based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate the business in the ordinary course

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 40 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases recent studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 72 of patients with type 2 diabetes and approximately 80 of patients with congestive heart failure in relation to diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa

have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway implanting a device to add support to the soft palate or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask contains an inflatable air pocket which conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal in 2002 we introduced the autoset spirit flow generator our secondgeneration autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat osa in 2003 we introduced the mirage activa nasal mask with active cushion technology to seal automatically mask leaks in 2004 we introduced the mirage swift nasal pillows system a less obtrusive lightweight and flexible alternative to nasal masks in 2005 we introduced the s8 range of cpap a small flow generator with optional integrated humidification in 2007 we introduced the mirage quattro a full face mask that offers dualwall cushion with spring air technology which accommodates movement during sleep and the mirage liberty which combines our nasal pillow technology in a full face mask product with a minimalist design in 2008 we launched several new patient interfaces including the mirage micro a new generation nasal mask with a microfit dial and the swift lt which offers a pillow system for additional support and comfort in 2008 we also launched an updated version of our s8 flow generator and the vpap auto a new bilevel device incorporating our new motor technology including the easybreathe waveform we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 12 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2008 we invested 605 million or 7 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 70 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation 

  

during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 we donated 20 million nil and 08 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs recent studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of 

  

 6  

cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology in 2007 we received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation and was first made available to a select group of us key opinion leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 adaptive servoventilation utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators accounted for approximately 50 52 and 52 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

 7  

with the acquisition of saime sa in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices compliment our vpap iii vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance

accessories and other products 

  

to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire h2i and h3i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the reslink rescontrol rescontrol ii txcontrol resscan and restraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators 

  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology which automatically seals mask leaks in 2004 we launched our mirage swift mask a light and unobtrusive nasal cannula mask system also in 2004 we launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the united states only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea in 2006 we launched the adapt sv within the united states this product is for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing and uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients typically our internal development staff then develops these ideas where appropriate into new products 

  

in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 we invested 605 million 501 million and 372 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 70 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies see note 16 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information about our geographic areas 

  

 14  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our us field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the united states 

  

we also market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

sales in north and latin america accounted for 49 53 and 52 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany spain sweden norway netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we sell our products direct a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

sales in europe accounted for 43 39 and 39 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

asia pacific we have wholly–owned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan malaysia new zealand singapore china and india we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in asia pacific sales in asia pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 8 8 and 9 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue other suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the comorbidity of sdb in cardiovascular disease patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke 

  

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our partnership with the american diabetes association a sleep laboratory is now present at every diabetes expo meeting where patients have the opportunity to learn about diabetes selfmanagement 

  

in june 2008 the international diabetes federation idf released a statement on sdb and type 2 diabetes the idf taskforce on epidemiology and prevention strongly recommended that health 

  

 15  

professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and sdb adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other furthermore the idf recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for osa particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance we also announced a comarketing agreement with lifescan a johnson and johnson company to increase the level of education and awareness of sdb in the diabetic population we also announced a comarketing agreement with lifescan a johnson and johnson company to increase the level of education and awareness of sdb in the diabetic population 

  

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices and the medical device directive 9342eec our sydney australia and san diego california facilities are each accredited to iso 9001 and iso 13485 these two sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

as part of the acquisition of saime sa on may 19 2005 we acquired a 7000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of the saime brand of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at the resmed motor technologies inc facility which comprises a 72000 square feet facility at chatsworth california 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed healthcare or legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

 16  

for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 act reduced medical reimbursement for respiratory drugs and home oxygen to homecare providers and placed a freeze on current reimbursement levels for durable medical equipment dme through 2008 as required by the 2003 act medicare plans to implement competitive bidding of durable medical equipment in 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas msa by the end of 2007 and in 80 of the largest msas by the end of 2009 in addition the us congress passed the deficit reduction act of 2005 2005 act in february 2006 which contained medicare payment reductions for home oxygen equipment and certain durable medical equipment classified by medicare as capped rental equipment in august 2006 the centers for medicare and medicaid services published a proposed regulation to implement the 2005 act which could reduce medicare reimbursement in 2007 for oxygen equipment additional reimbursement reductions for home oxygen were proposed in president bush’s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal and could also be enacted into law both the federal government and state legislatures are considering options for containing growth in the medicaid program 

  

even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home healthcare dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal 

  

 17  

market philips bv who recently acquired respironics inc a previous competitor devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc nellcor puritan bennett a division of covidien ltd and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited are the primary competitors for our products our principal european competitors are also philips devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited map medizintechnologie gmbh resmed motor technologies inc and saime sas we own or have licensed rights to 342 issued united states patents including 143 design patents and 457 issued foreign patents in addition there are 401 pending united states patent applications including 96 design patent applications 750 pending foreign patent applications 851 registered foreign designs and 177 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products of our patents 8 united states patents and 33 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with 2 foreign patent due to expire in 2010 18 in 2011 9 in 2012 and 4 in 2013 and 1 united states patent in 2009 2 united states patents in 2010 4 united states patents in 2011 and 1 united states patent in 2013 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals 

  

 18  

recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2008 we had approximately 2700 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 1050 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 350 in research and development and 1300 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1100 were located in australia 600 in north and south america 900 in europe and 100 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately the 3000 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home healthcare dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to market effectively our products outside the us could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us in over 70 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments which may adversely impact our ability to market our products if we are unable to market effectively our products outside the us our overall financial performance could decline 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and research and development costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

 20  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage effectively and efficiently our growth our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer during the past four fiscal years we have acquired western medical marketing polarmed pulmomed saime hoefner and resprecare we continue to integrate these acquisitions into our operations the integration requires significant efforts from each company and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 51 and 47 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse patients for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of the company’s products therefore even if a product is approved for 

  

 21  

marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights may harm our business 

  

as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs or other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and medicare 

  

in addition to reimbursement for our products our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products any proposed reductions in reimbursement if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results for example in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date 

  

 22  

no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported the initial estimated cost of this action was 597 million which we recognized as an expense in the year ended june 30 2007 an additional 31 million expense was recognized during the year ended june 30 2008 reflecting an increase in return rates and consulting charges we cannot assure you that this will be the total cost for the recall or that the total cost will not significantly exceed our estimates moreover we cannot predict the effect this recall and the negative publicity associated with the recall will have on our reputation among physicians and customers our results of operations could be severely impacted if we have failed to accurately estimate the costs of this product recall if the fda requires us to expand the scope of our recall or if physicians and customers cease to recommend and purchase our products as a result of this product recall 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer 

  

we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

the company is subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes failure by the company to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of the company’s products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which the company conducts business as a device manufacturer the company is required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation “qsr” requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require the company to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community the company is required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell its products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety 

  

 23  

concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to the company’s products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 

  

a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others for example we are currently appealing the decision of a court in germany that entered judgment in favor of certain 

  

 24  

plaintiffs that had claimed they should be listed as coinventors on two of our german patent applications the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported however we would likely be subject to product liability claims should any of these devices malfunction resulting in injury to a patient or damage to property any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing german tax audit any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 25  

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 

  

additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

we may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally three of our nine directors and three of our seven executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts

during september and october 2004 we began receiving tax assessment notices for the audit of one of our german subsidiaries by the german tax authorities for the years 1996 through 1998 certain aspects of these assessment notices are being contested and appealed to the german tax authority office as the outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted with certainty any tax issues resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations may require us to adjust our provision for income tax in the period of resolution

management’s discussion and analysis “mda” of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included herein 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing “sdb” and other respiratory disorders during the fiscal year we continued our efforts in building awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this underpenetrated market in our efforts we have raised awareness through a number of market initiatives which highlighted the increasing link between the potential effect sdb can have on cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes in conjunction with these direct efforts we also donated 20 million to the resmed foundation in the united states during fiscal year 2008 the foundation’s overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 

  

we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements during fiscal year 2008 we invested approximately 605 million on research and development activities which represents 7 of revenue since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories during fiscal year 2008 we were encouraged by the market response to our new full face mask offerings the quattro and liberty our new nasal pillows mask the swift lt and our next generation nasal mask the mirage micro we also launched the flow generator s8 ii and a new bilevel device the vpap auto these new offerings will enable us to capitalize on continuing developments in patient needs whilst also positioning us for future growth 

  

during the year our industry has seen some significant market developments major cardiac associations have begun advocating screening and treating cardiac patients for sdb whilst the international diabetes foundation “idf” has issued a consensus statement recommending the screening of type 2 diabetes patients suspected of sleep apnea in the us medicare approved reimbursement of home sleep testing to diagnose patients with obstructive sleep apnea this ruling will offer patients the option to be assessed through a facilitybased test in a lab or through a portable diagnostic test performed in the patient’s home we believe this will increase the diagnostic capacity in the us industry allowing greater access for patients several us large private insurers have followed suit and the industry is now well positioned for the next wave of patients seeking diagnosis and treatment 

  

we reported record financial results in fiscal year 2008 with an increase in net revenue of 17 to 8354 million compared to fiscal year 2007 gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 4938 million from 3845 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 1093 million or 28 the increase in gross margin is primarily due to 597 million of voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 during the year ended june 30 2008 we also recognized an additional charge of 31 million in relation to the product recall announced in the prior year our net income for the year ended june 30 2008 was 1103 million or 140 per diluted share compared to net income of 663 million or 085 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of the voluntary product recall expenses diluted earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2008 was 143 an increase of 4 over the year ended june 30 2007 of 138 

  

 31  

total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2008 was 1378 million which represents a 51 increase from the year ended june 30 2007 at june 30 2008 our cash and cash equivalents totaled 3211 million our total assets increased by 12 to 14 billion and our shareholders’ equity was up 16 to 11 billion during fiscal year 2008 we repurchased 2570700 shares at a cost of 995 million as part of our approved share buyback program 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2008 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 8354 million from 7163 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 1191 million or 17 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories and a strong contribution from our new full face masks movements in international currencies against the us dollar positively impacted revenues by approximately 427 million for the year ended june 30 2008 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2008 increased by 11 compared to the year ended june 30 2007 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 4096 million from 3767 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 329 million or 9 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing and growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator swift lt nasal pillows mask and mirage quattro fullface mask 

  

net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 4258 million from 3396 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 25 this sales growth outside north and latin america predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market growth generated from our recent product releases including the s8ii flow generator and mirage quattro fullface mask and the positive impact from movements of international currencies against the us dollar excluding the positive impact from movements of international currencies international sales grew by 13 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2008 totaled 4185 million an increase of 13 compared to the year ended june 30 2007 including increases of 3 in north and latin america and 20 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 4169 million an increase of 21 including increases of 13 in north and latin america and 35 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2008 compared to the year ended june 30 2007 we believe these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and contributions from new products 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 4938 million from 3845 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 1093 million or 28 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 59 from 54 for the year ended june 30 2007 the increase in gross margin is primarily due to 597 million of voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 during the year ended june 30 2008 we also recognized an additional charge of 31 million in relation to the product recall announced in 2007 due to higher than original estimated return rates and consulting charges excluding voluntary product recall expenses gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 59 for the year ended june 30 2008 which is lower than the year ended june 30 2007 of 62 the lower gross margin excluding the voluntary product recall expense is primarily due to a general reduction in average selling prices appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements 

  

 32  

voluntary product recall expenses on april 23 2007 we initiated a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 units of our early production s8 flow generators in these particular units which were manufactured between july 2004 and may 15 2006 there was what we considered to be a remote potential for a short circuit in the power supply connector the initial estimated cost of this recall action was 597 million which was recognized as a charge to cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of income during the year ended june 30 2007 during the year ended june 30 2008 we recognized an additional charge of 31 million due to higher than original estimated return rates and consulting charges at june 30 2008 the recall accrual was 10 million 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 2781 million from 2373 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 408 million or 17 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2008 was 33 and is consistent with the year ended june 30 2007 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth continued infrastructure investment particularly in our european businesses stockbased compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 188 million to our expenses for the year ended june 30 2008 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 32 to 34 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2008 to 605 million from 501 million for the year ended june 30 2007 an increase of 104 million or 21 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 7 for the year ended june 30 2008 and are consistent with the year ended june 30 2007 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products the increase in research and development expenses was also attributable to the net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 71 million to our expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future research and development expense to continue at approximately 7 

  

donations to foundations in the years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 we donated 20 million and nil respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states the foundations’ overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2008 totaled 78 million compared to 69 million for the year ended june 30 2007 the increase in amortization expense is attributable to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in euros 

  

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended june 30 2008 were 24 million compared to nil for the year ended june 30 2007 restructuring expenses consisted of expenses associated with our decision to streamline european management including the closure of part of the european headquarters in basel switzerland and two regional offices in the netherlands 

  

 33  

the restructuring expenses mainly comprise employee termination costs leasehold improvement writedowns and property lease exit costs we will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies and cost savings 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2008 was 149 million an increase of 70 million over the year ended june 30 2007 this was predominantly due to higher interest income on additional cash balances and a 59 million gain on the sale of our poway property these impacts were partly offset by a 32 million impairment writedown of our at costmethod investments 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to approximately 301 for the year ended june 30 2008 from approximately 323 for the year ended june 30 2007 our effective income tax rate was impacted by the tax benefit associated with the voluntary product recall expense that was recognized during the years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 excluding the impact of voluntary product recall expenses the effective income tax rate was 301 and 314 for the years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively the reduction in the full year effective tax rate is mainly due to factors such as an increase in the concessional rd tax claim in australia and a 10 decrease in the german corporate tax rate we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2008 was 1103 million or 140 per diluted share compared to net income of 663 million or 085 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2007 the net after tax impact of the voluntary product recall expense of 22 million described above resulted in a reduction of diluted earnings per share of 003 on an aftertax basis for the year ended june 30 2008 compared to 418 million or 053 diluted earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of the voluntary product recall expenses diluted earnings per share for the year ended june 30 2008 was 143 an increase of 4 over the year ended june 30 2007 of 138

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 7163 million from 6070 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 1093 million or 18 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar positively impacted revenues by approximately 205 million for the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2007 increased by 15 compared to the year ended june 30 2006 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 3767 million from 3210 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 557 million or 17 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing together with our continued investment in our sales force and marketing initiatives recent product releases in particular the adapt sv swift ii and mirage quattro have also contributed to our sales growth 

  

net revenue in markets outside the americas increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 3396 million from 2860 million for the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively an increase of 19 international sales growth predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and the positive impact from movements of international currencies against the us dollar excluding the positive impact from movements of international currencies international sales grew by 12

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 3845 million from 3769 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 76 million or 2 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 54 from 62 for the year ended june 30 2006 the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to 597 million of voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 excluding voluntary product recall expenses gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 62 for the year ended june 30 2007 which is consistent with the year ended june 30 2006 stockbased compensation expenses of 11 million have been included in cost of sales for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to 09 million for the year ended june 30 2006 

  

voluntary product recall expenses on april 23 2007 we initiated a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 units of our early production s8 flow generators in these particular units which were manufactured between july 2004 and may 15 2006 there is a remote potential for a short circuit in the power supply connector 

  

the estimated cost of this recall action is 597 million which has been recognized as a charge to cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of income during the year ended june 30 2007 at june 30 2007 we have incurred costs of approximately 163 million associated with the product recall we expect the product recall to continue throughout fiscal year 2008 we cannot assure that the actual costs of the product recall will not differ from the amount we have estimated and recognized in our financial statements 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 2373 million from 2002 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 371 million or 19 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 was 33 and is consistent with the year ended june 30 2006 stockbased compensation expenses of 145 million have been included within selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to 124 million for the year ended june 30 2006 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth continued infrastructure investment particularly in our european businesses stockbased compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 90 million to our expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 32 to 34 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 501 million from 372 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 129 million or 35 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 7 for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to 6 for the year ended june 30 2006 stockbased compensation costs of 20 million have been included within research and development expenses for both the year ended june 30 2007 and the year ended june 30 2006 

  

 35  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products the increase in research and development expenses was also attributable to net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 24 million to our expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future research and development expense to continue in the range of 6 to 7 

  

donations to foundations in the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 we donated nil and 08 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia the foundations’ overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2007 totaled 69 million compared to 63 million for the year ended june 30 2006 the increase in amortization expense is mainly attributable to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in euros the amortized amounts in 2007 related to acquired intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of pulmomed polarmed saime hoefner and resprecare 

  

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended june 30 2007 were nil compared to 11 million for the year ended june 30 2006 restructuring expenses for 2006 consisted of restructure charges associated with our integration of the separate operations of resmed germany and map into a single operating unit we have completed the relocation of our resmed germany operation previously located in moenchengladbach to munich and associated integration of the back office functions including customer service logistics and administration 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2007 was 78 million an increase of 57 million over the year ended june 30 2006 this was predominantly due to higher interest income on additional cash balances lower interest expense due to the reduction in our convertible debt which was converted into equity during the quarter ended march 31 2006 and higher foreign currency gains on foreign currency transactions and hedging 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to approximately 323 for the year ended june 30 2007 from approximately 339 for the year ended june 30 2006 our effective income tax rate was impacted by the tax benefit associated with the voluntary product recall expense that was recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of voluntary product recall expenses the effective income tax rate was 314 for the year ended june 30 2007 

  

the decrease in our effective tax rate from june 30 2006 is primarily due to the onetime additional income tax expense of 35 million which we incurred during the year ended june 30 2006 associated with the repatriation of 75 million in dividends received from certain controlled foreign corporations these dividend payments were made to take advantage of a temporary tax incentive under the american jobs creation act of 2004 which provides an 85 exclusion from us taxable income for qualifying dividends we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia excluding the impact of tax expense associated with the dividend payment in fiscal year 2006 our effective tax rate was 312 which is broadly consistent with our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007

stockbased compensation costs 

  

we have granted stock options to personnel including officers and directors under our 2006 incentive award plan as amended the “2006 plan” these options have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over four years we granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant we have also offered to our personnel including officers and directors the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” 

  

as of july 1 2005 we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest under this method the provisions of sfas 123r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption in addition the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption determined under the original provisions of sfas no 123 shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model such value is recognized as expense over the service period using the gradedattribution method for stockbased awards granted prior to july 1 2005 and the straightline method for stockbased awards granted after july 1 2005 

  

the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under our espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model assuming no dividends and the following assumptions 

  



  

expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to their expected term we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the additional use of the implied volatilities are more representative of our future stock price trends the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 30 and approximately 34 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous 

  

 40  

factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the level of nondeductible expenses and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances contingencies and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would 

  

 41  

influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force we do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such shipments our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r we measure the compensation of all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a blackscholes valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options the riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based 

  

 42  

upon us treasury yield curve appropriate for the expected life of the awards expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we have used historical rates by employee groups the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense we record to vary 

  

8 voluntary product recall expenses we recognized an accrual for the estimated cost of the voluntary product recall at the time the liability was probable and the related expenses could be reasonably estimated the amount of this accrual was determined taking into consideration the future probable expenses directly related to the product recall including expected return rates for the affected units unit replacement costs legal consulting logistical and administrative expenses should actual product recall costs differ from our estimated costs or should we receive additional feedback from our ongoing discussions with regulatory bodies revisions to our estimated product recall accrual may be required 

  

9 income tax we have adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” on july 1 2007 in accordance with fin 48 we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” under the requirements of sfas no 141r the acquiring entity will be required to recognise all assets and liabilities acquired in a transaction at their acquisition date fair value sfas no 141r will also change the accounting treatment for specific transactions such as the recognition of contingent liabilities the recognition of capitalized inprocess research and development restructuring costs the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and changes in the income tax valuation allowances sfas no 141r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after july 1 2009 with early adoption prohibited the adoption of this standard will not impact our current financial statements but we are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our future financial statements

credit market risk 

  

at june 30 2008 we held a number of investment securities in aaa rated auction securities with various maturities between july 2039 and november 2047 these investments had regular rollover or auction dates at which time the interest rates were reset or the investments were redeemed for cash during the year ended june 30 2008 we experienced failed auctions with respect to these investments due to the current liquidity issues surrounding the domestic and global capital markets we continue to earn interest on these investments in accordance with the contract until the next auction occurs in the event we need to access funds invested in these auction rate securities we may not be able to liquidate these securities at the fair value recorded on june 30 2008 until a future auction of these securities is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process however we believe the current lack of liquidity of these investments is temporary due to the current market conditions and our intention to hold these investments until there is an overall improvement in global credit markets accordingly we have reclassified these securities from current to noncurrent assets and recognised a charge of 04 million to comprehensive income within shareholder’s equity to reflect the fair market value of these securities at june 30 2008 

  

additionally based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate the business in the ordinary course

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

we employ approximately 2700 people and sell our products in over 68 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our americas asiapacific and european operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including 

  



  

segment information 

  

the company believes that given the single market focus of its operations solely in the sleepdisordered breathing sector of the respiratory medicine industry and the interdependence of its products the company operates as a single operating segment see note 16 – segment information of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 for financial information regarding segment reporting financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of 

  

 3  

total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 43 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases recent studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 60 of stroke patients and approximately 50 of patients with congestive heart failure more recently studies have shown a connection between sdb and diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

 4  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway implanting a device to add support to the soft palate or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased 

  

 5  

diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask contains an inflatable air pocket which conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal in 2002 we introduced the autoset spirit flow generator our secondgeneration autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat osa in 2003 we introduced the mirage activa nasal mask with active cushion technology to automatically seal mask leaks in 2004 we introduced the mirage swift nasal pillows system a less obtrusive lightweight and flexible alternative to nasal masks in 2005 we introduced the s8 range of cpap a small flow generator with optional integrated humidification in 2007 we launched several new patient interfaces including the mirage quattro a full face mask that offers dualwall cushion with spring air technology which accommodates movement during sleep and the mirage liberty which combines our nasal pillow technology in a full face mask product with a minimalist design we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 12 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2007 we invested 501 million or 7 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 68 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation 

  

during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 we donated nil 08 million and 05 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs recent studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology we have recently received food and drug administration or fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the adapt sv the adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation and was first made available to a select group of us key opinion leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 adaptive servoventilation utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this 

  

 6  

technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators accounted for approximately 52 52 and 49 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

 7  

with the acquisition of saime sa in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices complement our vpap iii vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance

to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire h2i and h3i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the reslink rescontrol and rescontrol ii modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators since the may 2002 acquisition of resmed motor technologies inc we have also sold custom electric motors primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications but we do not expect custom electric motor sales to contribute material revenues in the future 

  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications 

  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology which automatically seals mask leaks in 2004 we launched our mirage swift mask a light and unobtrusive nasal cannula mask system also in 2004 we launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the united states only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea in 2006 we launched the adapt sv within the united states this product is for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing and uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these physicians served on our medical advisory board during fiscal year 2006 during fiscal year 2007 we reorganized our medical advisory board into several regional advisory boards new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients typically our internal development staff then develops these ideas where appropriate into new products 

  

in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 we invested 501 million 372 million and 300 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 68 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach 

  

 13  

to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists and regional sales directors our us field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the united states 

  

we also promote and market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

in the united states our sales employees are managed by the chief operating officer americas and vice president of sales sales in north and latin america accounted for 53 52 and 51 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany spain sweden norway netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that sell our products directly into those countries we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we have a subsidiary a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

our european chief operating officer is responsible for coordination of all european activities and in conjunction with local management the direct sales activity in europe sales in europe accounted for 39 39 and 41 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

asia pacific marketing in asia pacific and the rest of the world is the responsibility of our senior vice president sales  marketing asia pacific we have wholly–owned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan malaysia new zealand singapore china and india that sell our products directly into those countries we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors in australia and new zealand and use independent distributors to sell our products elsewhere in asia pacific sales in asia pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 8 9 and 8 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts we continue to pursue other suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the comorbidity of sdb in cardiovascular disease patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke 

  

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high 

  

 14  

prevalence of the sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population resmed is also reaching out to diabetes patients through our partnership with the american diabetes association a sleep laboratory is now present at every diabetes expo meeting where patients have the opportunity to learn about diabetes selfmanagement 

  

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 155000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices and the medical device directive 9342eec our sydney australia and san diego california facilities are each accredited to iso 9001 and iso 13485 these two sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

as part of the acquisition of saime sa on may 19 2005 we acquired a 7000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of the saime brand of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

we also manufacture highquality electric motors for our flow generator devices at our resmed motor technologies inc facility we have recently leased a larger site of 72000 square feet at chatsworth california and moved our resmed motor technology operations into this facility during the year ended june 30 2007 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed healthcare or legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

 15  

for example the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the 2003 act reduced medical reimbursement for respiratory drugs and home oxygen to homecare providers and placed a freeze on current reimbursement levels for durable medical equipment dme through 2008 as required by the 2003 act medicare plans to implement competitive bidding of durable medical equipment in 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas msa by the end of 2007 and in 80 of the largest msas by the end of 2009 in addition the us congress passed the deficit reduction act of 2005 2005 act in february 2006 which contained medicare payment reductions for home oxygen equipment and certain durable medical equipment classified by medicare as capped rental equipment in august 2006 the centers for medicare and medicaid services published a proposed regulation to implement the 2005 act which could reduce medicare reimbursement in 2007 for oxygen equipment additional reimbursement reductions for home oxygen were proposed in president bush’s fiscal year 2007 budget proposal and could also be enacted into law both the federal government and state legislatures are considering options for containing growth in the medicaid program 

  

even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home healthcare dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal 

  

 16  

market respironics inc devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc nellcor puritan bennett a division of covidien ltd and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited are the primary competitors for our products our principal european competitors are also respironics devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited map medizintechnologie gmbh resmed motor technologies inc and saime sas we own or have licensed rights to 271 issued united states patents including 82 design patents and 376 issued foreign patents in addition there are 338 pending united states patent applications including 113 design patent applications 641 pending foreign patent applications 610 registered foreign designs and 266 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 13 united states patents and 27 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with 1 foreign patent due to expire in 2008 2 in 2010 16 in 2011 and 8 in 2012 and 7 united states patents in 2008 2 united states patents in 2010 and 4 united states patents in 2011 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals 

  

 17  

recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2007 we had approximately 2700 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 1100 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 300 in research and development and 1300 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1150 were located in australia 550 in the united states 900 in europe and 100 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

 18  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately the 3000 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home healthcare dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to market effectively our products outside the us could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us in over 68 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments which may adversely impact our ability to market our products if we are unable to market effectively our products outside the us our overall financial performance could decline 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs and research and development costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

 19  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems information technology and quality and regulatory compliance systems among others unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage effectively and efficiently our growth our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer during the past three fiscal years we have acquired western medical marketing polarmed pulmomed saime hoefner and resprecare we continue to integrate these acquisitions into our operations the integration requires significant efforts from each company and we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 47 and 48 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse patients for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can without notice deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of the company’s products therefore even if a product is approved for 

  

 20  

marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia and the united kingdom there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights may harm our business 

  

as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs or other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and medicare 

  

in addition to reimbursement for our products our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products any proposed reductions in reimbursement if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results for example in april 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 of our s8 flow generators manufactured between july 2004 and may 2006 we have determined that there is a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector in only seven cases worldwide device failures have led to thermal damage to the device with a remote 

  

 21  

potential to ignite material external to the device to date no significant property damage or patient injury has been reported the estimated cost of this action is 597 million which we recognized as an expense in the year ended june 30 2007 we cannot assure you that this will be the total cost for the recall or that the total cost will not significantly exceed our estimates moreover we cannot predict the effect this recall and the negative publicity associated with the recall will have on our reputation among physicians and customers our results of operations could be severely impacted if we have failed to accurately estimate the costs of this product recall or if physicians and customers cease to recommend and purchase our products as a result of this product recall 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510k clearance process we have modified some of our section 510k approved products without submitting new section 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer 

  

we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

the company is subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes failure by the company to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations the fda regulates the approval manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of the company’s products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada japan europe and other countries in which the company conducts business as a device manufacturer the company is required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda’s quality system regulation “qsr” requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures in addition the federal medical device reporting regulations require the company to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda in the european community the company is required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell its products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns product recalls or related field actions product shortages or delays in product manufacturing efficacy or safety concerns an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace andor manufacturing quality issues with respect to the company’s products could lead to product recalls or related field actions withdrawals andor declining sales 

  

 22  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 

  

a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others for example we are currently appealing the decision of a court in germany that entered judgment in favor of certain plaintiffs that had claimed they should be listed as coinventors on two of our german patent applications the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those

on acquisition of saime in may 2005 we recognized as an expense a charge of 53 million with respect to iprd programs under active development by saime that at date of acquisition had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 

  

stockbased compensation costs 

  

we have granted stock options to personnel including officers and directors under our 1995 option plan the “1995 plan” our 1997 equity participation plan the “1997 plan” and our 2006 incentive award plan as amended the “2006 plan” and together with the 1995 plan and the 1997 plan the “plans” these options have expiration dates of seven or ten years from the date of grant and vest over three or four years we granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant we have also offered to our personnel including officers and directors the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan “espp” 

  

as of july 1 2005 we adopted sfas no123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest under this method the provisions of sfas no123r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption in addition the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption determined under the original provisions of sfas no123 “accounting for stock based compensation” “sfas 123” shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model such value is recognized as expense over the service period using the gradedattribution method for stockbased awards granted prior to july 1 2005 and the straightline method for stockbased awards granted after july 1 2005 

  

the fair value of stock options granted under the plans and purchase rights granted under our espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model assuming no dividends and the following assumptions 

  



  

expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and implied volatilities from traded options of our stock the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules 

  

 33  

and our historical exercise patterns the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 32 and approximately 34 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the level of nondeductible expenses and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2007 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2006 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 7163 million from 6070 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 1093 million or 18 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories movements in international currencies against the us dollar positively impacted revenues by approximately 205 million for the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2007 increased by 15 compared to the year ended june 30 2006 

  

net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 3767 million from 3210 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 557 million or 17 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing together with our continued investment in our sales force and marketing initiatives recent product releases in particular the adapt sv swift ii and mirage quattro have also contributed to our sales growth 

  

net revenue in markets outside the americas increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 3396 million from 2860 million for the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively an increase of 19 international sales growth predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and the positive impact from movements of international currencies against the us dollar excluding the positive impact from movements of international currencies international sales grew by 12 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2007 totaled 3706 million an increase of 17 compared to the year ended june 30 2006 including increases of 19 in north and latin america and 16 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 3458 million an increase of 19 including increases of 16 in north and latin america and 24 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to the year ended june 30 2006 we believe these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and contributions from new products 

  

 34  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 3845 million from 3769 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 76 million or 2 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 54 from 62 for the year ended june 30 2006 the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to 597 million of voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 excluding voluntary product recall expenses gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 62 for the year ended june 30 2007 which is consistent with the year ended june 30 2006 stockbased compensation expenses of 11 million have been included in cost of sales for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to 09 million for the year ended june 30 2006 

  

voluntary product recall expenses on april 23 2007 we initiated a worldwide voluntary product recall of approximately 300000 units of our early production s8 flow generators in these particular units which were manufactured between july 2004 and may 15 2006 there is a remote potential for a short circuit in the power supply connector furthermore in seven cases worldwide device failures have led to thermal damage to the device with a remote potential to ignite material external to the device we are working with our distribution partners globally to provide a replacement device to patients who have an affected s8 flow generator 

  

the estimated cost of this recall action is 597 million which has been recognized as a charge to cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statement of income during the year ended june 30 2007 at june 30 2007 we have incurred costs of approximately 163 million associated with the product recall we expect the product recall to continue throughout fiscal year 2008 we cannot assure that the actual costs of the product recall will not differ from the amount we have estimated and recognized in our financial statements 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 2373 million from 2002 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 371 million or 19 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 was 33 and is consistent with the year ended june 30 2006 stockbased compensation expenses of 145 million have been included within selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to 124 million for the year ended june 30 2006 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth continued infrastructure investment particularly in our european businesses stockbased compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 90 million to our expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 32 to 34 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2007 to 501 million from 372 million for the year ended june 30 2006 an increase of 129 million or 35 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 7 for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to 6 for the year ended june 30 2006 stockbased compensation costs of 20 million have been included within research and development expenses for both the year ended june 30 2007 and the year ended june 30 2006 

  

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products the increase in research 

  

 35  

and development expenses was also attributable to net appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 24 million to our expenses for the year ended june 30 2007 as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future research and development expense to continue in the range of 6 to 7 

  

donations to foundations in the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 we donated nil and 08 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia the foundations’ overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 

  

amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30 2007 totaled 69 million compared to 63 million for the year ended june 30 2006 the increase in amortization expense is mainly attributable to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in euros the amortized amounts in 2007 related to acquired intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of pulmomed polarmed saime hoefner and resprecare 

  

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended june 30 2007 were nil compared to 11 million for the year ended june 30 2006 restructuring expenses for 2006 consisted of restructure charges associated with our integration of the separate operations of resmed germany and map into a single operating unit we have completed the relocation of our resmed germany operation previously located in moenchengladbach to munich and associated integration of the back office functions including customer service logistics and administration 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2007 was 78 million an increase of 57 million over the year ended june 30 2006 this was predominantly due to higher interest income on additional cash balances lower interest expense due to the reduction in our convertible debt which was converted into equity during the quarter ended march 31 2006 and higher foreign currency gains on foreign currency transactions and hedging 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to approximately 323 for the year ended june 30 2007 from approximately 339 for the year ended june 30 2006 our effective income tax rate was impacted by the tax benefit associated with the voluntary product recall expense that was recognized during the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of voluntary product recall expenses the effective income tax rate was 314 for the year ended june 30 2007 

  

the decrease in our effective tax rate from june 30 2006 is primarily due to the onetime additional income tax expense of 35 million which we incurred during the year ended june 30 2006 associated with the repatriation of 75 million in dividends received from certain controlled foreign corporations these dividend payments were made to take advantage of a temporary tax incentive under the american jobs creation act of 2004 which provides an 85 exclusion from us taxable income for qualifying dividends 

  

we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia excluding the impact of tax expense associated with the dividend payment in fiscal year 2006 our effective tax rate was 312 which is broadly consistent with our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2007 was 663 million or 085 per diluted share compared to net income of 882 million or 116 per diluted 

  

 36  

share for the year ended june 30 2006 the net after tax impact of the voluntary product recall expense of 418 million described above resulted in a reduction of diluted earnings per share of 053 on an aftertax basis for the year ended june 30 2007 excluding the impact of the voluntary product recall expense diluted earnings per share was 138 an increase of 19 over the year ended june 30 2006

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2006 to 6070 million from 4255 million for the year ended june 30 2005 an increase of 1815 million or 43 the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories and incremental sales contributed from acquisitions sales were negatively impacted by the appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar decreasing sales by approximately 113 million 

  

excluding the impact of acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency movements sales for the year ended june 30 2006 increased by 32 compared to the year ended june 30 2005 net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30 2006 to 3210 million from 2181 million for the year ended june 30 2005 an increase of 1029 million or 47 this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing together with our continued investment in our sales force and marketing initiatives recent product releases in particular our mirage swift mask and s8 flow generator platform have also contributed strongly to our sales growth

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2006 totaled 3166 million an increase of 51 compared to the year ended june 30 2005 including increases of 47 in north and latin america and 53 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories totaled 2904 million an increase of 35 including increases of 47 in north and latin america and 16 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2006 compared to the year ended june 30 2005 these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market acquisitions during the year and new product releases particularly the mirage swift mask and our new flow generator platform the s8 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2006 to 3769 million from 2749 million for the year ended june 30 2005 an increase of 1020 million or 37 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the year ended june 30 2006 to 62 from 65 for the year ended june 30 2005 the reduction in gross margin reflects the change in product and geographical mix of sales with a higher proportion of sales in flow generators which generate lower margins relative to our mask sales and higher north and latin american sales which also typically generate lower margins relative to our international sales as well as the additional stockbased compensation costs stockbased compensation expenses of 09 million have been included within cost of sales for the year ended june 30 2006 as compared to no stockbased compensation expense for the year ended june 30 2005

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2006 to 2002 million from 1357 million for the year ended june 30 2005 an increase of 645 million or 48 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2006 was 33 marginally higher than 32 in the year ended june 30 2005 stockbased compensation expenses of 124 million have been included within selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2006 excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expenses as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2006 were 31 which is marginally lower than 32 in the year ended june 30 2005 

  

the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to stockbased compensation costs an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth the acquisitions of resprecare hoefner saime polarmed and pulmomed continued infrastructure investment particularly in our european businesses and other expenses related to the increase in our sales as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 31 to 34

donations to foundations in the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 we donated 08 million and 05 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia the foundations’ overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 

  

inprocess research and development charge no inprocess research and development charge was incurred for the year ended june 30 2006 for the year ended june 30 2005 purchased inprocess research and development of 53 million was expensed upon the acquisition of saime as technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed

restructuring expenses restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended june 30 2006 were 11 million compared to 52 million for the year ended june 30 2005 restructuring expenses for 2006 consisted of restructure charges associated with our integration of the separate operations of resmed germany and map into a single operating unit we have completed the relocation of our resmed germany operation previously located in moenchengladbach to munich and associated integration of the back office functions including customer service logistics and administration we plan to continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly in an effort to maximize efficiencies and cost savings 

  

other income expense net other income net for the year ended june 30 2006 was 21 million an increase of 28 million from other expense net of 07 million for the year ended 

  

 38  

june 30 2005 this was predominantly due to higher interest income on additional cash balances and the lower interest expense due to the reduction in our convertible debt which was converted into equity during the quarter ended march 31 2006 other factors included higher foreign currency gains on foreign currency transactions and hedging offset by an impairment loss of 12 million on one of our cost method investments 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to approximately 339 for the year ended june 30 2006 from approximately 330 for the year ended june 30 2005 this was primarily due to the onetime additional income tax expense of 35 million associated with the repatriation of 75 million in dividends received from certain controlled foreign corporations these dividend payments were made to take advantage of a temporary tax incentive under the american jobs creation act of 2004 which provides an 85 exclusion from us taxable income for qualifying dividends the repatriation of these funds to the united states provides us with increased flexibility in the utilization of cash to further our strategic objectives 

  

excluding the impact of the onetime additional income tax expense of 35 million relating to the dividend repatriation the effective tax rate for the year ended june 30 2006 was 312 this compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 312 for the year ended june 30 2005 when excluding the impact of the nondeductible inprocess research and development charge of 53 million incurred in the prior year we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian research and development tax benefits because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2006 was 882 million or 116 per diluted share compared to net income of 648 million or 091 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2005 the net after tax impact of stockbased compensation costs restructuring expenses inprocess research and development charge amortization of acquired intangible assets and the repatriation of funds described above resulted in a reduction of diluted earnings per share of 026 and 012 on an aftertax basis respectively for the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of june 30 2007 and june 30 2006 we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities availableforsale of 2777 million and 2195 million respectively working capital was 4664 million and 3813 million at june 30 2007 and june 30 2006 respectively the increase in working capital predominantly reflects the growth and profitability of the business during the year 

  

inventories at june 30 2007 increased by 410 million or 35 to 1572 million compared to june 30 2006 inventories of 1162 million the increase in inventories was higher than the increase of 18 in revenues in the year ended june 30 2007 compared to the year ended june 30 2006 which we believe reflects increased inventory levels to accommodate our increasing sales and the launch of several new products including the vpap malibu and tango flow generators and the mirage quattro and mirage liberty masks 

  

accounts receivable at june 30 2007 were 1678 million an increase of 297 million or 21 over the june 30 2006 accounts receivable balance of 1381 million the increase was higher than the 18 incremental increase in revenues for the year ended june 30 2007 compared to the year ended june 30 2006 accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 77 days at june 30 2007 increased by 7 days compared to 70 days at june 30 2006 the increase was predominantly attributable to increases in credit terms in response to competitor actions our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30 2007 and 2006 was 27 and 33 respectively the credit quality of our customers remains consistent with our past experience 

  

 39  

during the year ended june 30 2007 we generated cash of 911 million from operations this was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30 2006 of 990 million and was primarily the result of the decrease in net income higher working capital balances and product recall costs the cash generated from operations included a reduction of 124 million and 98 million for the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively due to the adoption of sfas 123r as tax benefits associated with employee stock options exercised during the year are required to be included within cashflows from financing activities 

  

capital expenditures for the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 aggregated 776 million and 1027 million respectively the capital expenditures for the year ended june 30 2007 primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing research and development building office facilities computer hardware and software rental and loan equipment and purchase of production tooling equipment and machinery as a result of these capital expenditures our balance sheet reflects net property plant and equipment of approximately 3106 million at june 30 2007 compared to 2454 million at june 30 2006

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets 

  

 42  

and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances contingencies and stockbased compensation costs 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related 

  

 43  

to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force we do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such shipments our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no123r we measure the compensation of all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of awards employee class and historical experience actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 

  

8 voluntary product recall expenses we recognized an accrual for the estimated cost of the voluntary product recall at the time the liability was probable and the related expenses could be reasonably estimated the amount of this accrual was determined taking into consideration the future probable expenses directly related to the product recall including expected return rates for the affected units unit replacement costs legal consulting logistical and administrative expenses should actual product recall costs differ from our estimated costs or should we receive additional feedback from our ongoing discussions with regulatory bodies revisions to our estimated product recall accrual may be required 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” and subsequently in may 2007 issued fsp fin 481 “definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 48” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb 

  

 44  

statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50 probability threshold and also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for us beginning july 1 2007 and we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of this interpretation will have on our financial statements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb no 157 “fair value measurements” “fasb 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fasb 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements 

  

during the year ended june 30 2007 we adopted staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements” “sab 108” sab 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a onetime cumulative effect transition adjustment the adoption of sab 108 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas no 159” sfas no 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values with changes in fair value recognized in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for us beginning july 1 2008 although early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the potential impact if any should we elect the fair value option that adoption of sfas no 159 will have on our financial statements

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that resmed inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2007 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso resmed inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that resmed inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2007 is fairly stated in all material respects based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by coso also in our opinion resmed inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2007 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by coso 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of resmed inc and subsidiaries as of june 30 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended june 30 2007 and our report dated august 27 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing and other respiratory disorders sleepdisordered breathing or sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development efforts 

  

we employ approximately 2500 people and sell our products in over 67 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors 

  

our web site address is wwwresmedcom we make our periodic reports together with any amendments available on our web site free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the securities and exchange commission

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our americas asiapacific and european operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange or nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange or asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including 

  



  

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon 

  

 4  

dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the united states alone this represents approximately 43 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases recent studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 60 of stroke patients and approximately 50 of patients with congestive heart failure more recently studies have shown a connection between sdb and diabetes recent studies indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

 5  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway implanting a device to add support to the soft palate or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including variable positive airway pressure or vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask contains an inflatable air pocket which conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal in 2002 we introduced the autoset spirit flow generator our secondgeneration autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat osa in 2003 we introduced the mirage activa nasal mask with active cushion 

  

 6  

technology to automatically seal mask leaks in 2004 we introduced the mirage swift nasal pillows system a less obtrusive lightweight and flexible alternative to nasal masks in 2005 we introduced the s8 range of cpap a small flow generator with optional integrated humidification we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 12 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2006 we invested 372 million or 6 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 67 countries to sleep clinics home healthcare dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation 

  

during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we donated 08 million 05 million and 05 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs recent studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology we have recently received fda clearance and launched a new product in the united states for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing called the vpap adapt sv the vpap adapt sv uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation and was first made available to a select group of us key opinion leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 adaptive servoventilation utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patientspecific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target we believe this technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional pap therapy 

  

leverage the experience of our management team and medical advisory board our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular our medical advisory board is comprised of experts in the field of sdb we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

 7  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators accounted for approximately 52 49 and 50 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

 8  

with the acquisition of saime in may 2005 we increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices complement our vpap iii vpap adapt sv and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance

accessories and other products 

  

to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire h2i and h3i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits to assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the reslink rescontrol and rescontrol ii modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow generators map also offers a range of accessories including the twister remote an intelligent remote control for use in the sleep laboratory environment to set and monitor flow generators the aeroclick connection system which allows a quick simple connectdisconnect between the mask and cpap air delivery source and the aerofix headgear for the comfortable adjustment of masks for cpap therapy since the may 2002 acquisition of servo magnetics inc we have also sold custom electric motors primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications but we do not expect custom electric motor sales to contribute material revenues in the future 

  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications for example in 1997 we introduced the mirage mask this mask was based on the innovative bubble mask technology introduced in 1991 which used the principle of air inflation of the mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by better conforming to patient facial contours 

  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in september 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology which automatically seals mask leaks in august 2004 we launched our mirage swift mask a light and unobtrusive nasal cannula mask system also in august 2004 we launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the united states only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea in march 2006 we launched the vpap adapt sv within the united states this product is for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea mixed apnea and periodic breathing and uses a technology known as adaptive servoventilation 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom italy switzerland and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these physicians served on our medical advisory board during fiscal year 2006 during fiscal year 2007 we intend to reorganize our medical advisory board into several regional advisory boards new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients 

  

 14  

typically our internal development staff then develops these ideas where appropriate into new products 

  

in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 we invested 372 million 300 million and 262 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 67 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed to those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists regional sales directors and independent manufacturers’ representatives our us field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the united states our direct sales force receives a base salary plus commissions while our independent sales representatives receive higher commissions but no base salary 

  

we also promote and market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription the home healthcare dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

in the united states our sales employees and manufacturers’ representatives are managed by the chief operating officer americas and vice president of marketing our canadian and latin american sales are conducted through independent distributors sales in north and latin america accounted for 52 51 and 49 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany spain sweden norway netherlands switzerland and the united kingdom that sell our products directly into those countries we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we have a subsidiary a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home healthcare company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

our european chief operating officer is responsible for coordination of all european activities and in conjunction with local management the direct sales activity in europe sales in europe accounted for 39 41 and 43 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

asia pacific marketing in asia pacific and the rest of the world is the responsibility of our senior vice president sales  marketing asia pacific we have wholly–owned subsidiaries in australia 

  

 15  

hong kong japan malaysia new zealand and singapore that sell our products directly into those countries we use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors in australia and new zealand and use independent distributors to sell our products elsewhere in asia pacific sales in asia pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 9 8 and 8 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts in addition to our and our distributors’ sales efforts we work with the following cardiovascular disease associations to raise awareness of the comorbidity of sdb in cardiovascular disease patients including coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke 

  

   

   

   

we also continue to work to raise awareness of sdb in diabetes current research is increasingly showing an independent association between osa and type 2 diabetes accordingly we initiated a study investigating the prevalence of osa in the type 2 diabetic population due to the high prevalence of the coincidence of sdb and type 2 diabetes we are now actively supporting the american association of diabetes educators and are in the process of setting up further initiatives to develop the sdb market in the diabetic population 

  

in addition to the above marketing efforts we have strategic alliances with the guidant corporation and the medcath corporation the guidant corporation is a world leader in the treatment of cardiac disease guidant merged with boston scientific corporation during fiscal year 2006 since fiscal year 2003 we have had an agreement with guidant under which the companies will work together in the areas of sleepdisordered breathing and cardiac rhythm disorders disease states with a significant patient population overlap currently the companies plan to collaborate on research and development projects clinical studies as well as physician and patient education medcath develops owns and operates hospitals in partnership with cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons our alliance allows medcath to offer sdb screening diagnosis and treatment in conjunction with services currently offered through the company’s cardiovascular diagnostic centers we believe that our affiliations and continued work with these organizations raises the awareness of sdb as a significant health concern

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 215000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 iso 13485 fda quality system regulations for medical devices and the medical device directive 9342eec our sydney australia and san diego california facilities are each accredited to iso 9001 and iso 13485 these two sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

our german manufacturing operation based in munich operates in a facility of approximately 24000 square feet this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and primarily assembles and tests flow generators for sale by our german subsidiary appropriate quality controls monitor and measure product assembly and performance 

  

as part of the acquisition of saime sa on may 19 2005 we acquired a 7000 square foot manufacturing facility in paris france this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of the saime brand of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

we also manufacture highquality electric motors for both our flow generator devices and external customers primarily in the data storage sector at our servo magnetics inc or smi facility at canoga park california the smi facility is approximately 35500 square feet we have recently leased a larger site of 72000 square feet at chatsworth california and expect to move to this new smi facility in october 2006 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed healthcare or legislative proposals to reform healthcare could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

 17  

even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home healthcare dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than us in the united states our principal market respironics inc devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc nellcor puritan bennett a subsidiary of tyco inc and fisher  paykel healthcare corporation limited are the primary competitors for our products our principal european competitors are also respironics devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial 

  

 18  

quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited medizintechnik fur arzt und patient gmbh smi and saime sa we own or have licensed rights to 220 issued united states patents including 60 design patents and 325 issued foreign patents in addition there are 262 pending united states patent applications including 68 design patent applications 494 pending foreign patent applications 443 registered foreign designs and 122 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents 13 united states patents and 13 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with 1 foreign patent due to expire in 2008 2 in 2010 and 10 in 2011 and 1 united states patent in 2007 6 united states patents in 2008 2 united states patents in 2010 and 4 united states patents in 2011 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and regulations of relevant foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda approval requirements may extend the development process for a 

  

 19  

considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2006 we had approximately 2500 employees or full time consultants of which approximately 900 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 300 in research and development 1300 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants approximately 1100 were located in australia 500 in the united states 800 in europe and 100 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

medical advisory board 

  

our medical advisory board consists of physicians specializing in the field of sleepdisordered breathing and ventilation during fiscal 2006 the medical advisory board members met as a group with members of our senior management and members of our research and marketing departments to advise us on technology trends in sdb and other developments in sleep disorders medicine medical advisory board members are also available to consult on an asneeded basis with our senior management in alphabetical order medical advisory board members during fiscal 2006 included

before deciding to purchase hold or sell our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec including our subsequent reports on forms 10q and 8k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us our business financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed in that event the market price for our common stock will likely decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete current competitors new entrants academics and others are trying to develop new devices alternative treatments or cures and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately the 3000 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home healthcare dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we 

  

 21  

cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleepdisordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to market effectively our products outside the us could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us in over 67 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments which may adversely impact our ability to market our products if we are unable to market effectively our products outside the us our overall financial performance could decline 

  

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage effectively and efficiently our growth our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer during the year ended june 30 2006 we acquired polarmed and pulmomed and during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 we acquired saime hoefner and resprecare we are currently in the process of integrating our operations with these recent acquisitions the integration will require significant efforts from each company we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

  

if we fail to implement our restructure plans successfully our business could suffer in fiscal year 2005 we merged the operations of resmed germany and map into a single operating unit as part of our german restructure plan we will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies cost savings and success if we are not able to integrate the operations successfully we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the restructure 

  

 22  

we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 48 and 49 of our net revenues in the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse patients for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia and the united kingdom there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights may harm our business 

  

as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing in the united states we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and medicare 

  

in addition to reimbursement for our products our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products any proposed reductions in reimbursement if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 

  

failure to comply with antikickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration 

  

 23  

directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the us government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial conditions and results of operations 

  

complying with food and drug administration or fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees furthermore our products could be subject to recall if the fda or we determine for any reason that our products are not safe or effective any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the 510k clearance process we have modified some of our 510k approved products without submitting new 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer 

  

we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

 24  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 

  

a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products andor our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others for example we are currently appealing the decision of a court in germany that entered judgment in favor of certain plaintiffs that had claimed they should be listed as coinventors on two of our german patent applications the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

 25  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing german tax audit any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 

  

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

 26  

delaware law provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 

  

additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders under our stockholder rights plan we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our series a junior participating preferred stock at a discount under certain circumstances the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally two of our eight directors and three of our seven executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts

in the normal course of business we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business while the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that their final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole 

  

during september and october 2004 we began receiving tax assessment notices for the audit of one of our german subsidiaries by the german tax authorities for the years 1996 through 1998 certain of 

  

 27  

these adjustments are being contested and appealed to the german tax authority office we believe no additional provision is necessary for any tax adjustment that may result from the tax audit however the outcome of the audit cannot be predicted with certainty should any tax audit issues be resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income tax in the period of resolution 

  

on december 23 2002 three former contractors of our subsidiary map medizintechnologie gmbh initiated proceedings in munich 1 regional court proceedings no 7 o 2328602 petitioning the court for a declaration of inventorship with respect to map german patent applications identified as no 100 31 079 and 101 92 8025 and european patent application no ep 01 967 8197 on march 10 2005 the court entered judgement in favor of the plaintiffs finding that they should be identified as coinventors in place of certain individual defendants in april 2005 map filed an appeal of that decision we do not expect the outcome of this litigation to have an adverse material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in march 2006 an australian university made a demand that we pay extra royalties pursuant to a current patent license agreement we rejected the demand and the university has agreed to discuss our position we do not consider the claim to have merit we do not expect that the outcome of this demand to have an adverse material effect on our consolidated financial statements

inprocess research and development charge “iprd” 

  

on acquisition of saime in may 2005 we recognized as an expense a charge of 53 million with respect to iprd programs under active development by saime that at date of acquisition had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use the estimated fair value assigned to iprd was based on an independent appraisal and was comprised of the following projects in thousands 

  



  

the value of iprd was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established estimating the costs to develop the purchased inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products discounting the net cash flows to present value and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto the discount rate used in the analysis was 25 which was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets 

  

as of the date of acquisition these projects had estimated costs to complete totaling approximately 53 million the projects were in various stages of development but are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from one to three years 

  

we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets were reasonable at the time of acquisition no assurance can be given however that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues development costs or profitability or events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated for these reasons among others actual results may vary from the projected results 

  

stockbased compensation costs 

  

we have granted stock options to personnel including officers and directors under both our 1995 option plan and our 1997 equity participation plan which we refer to collectively as the plans these options have expiration dates of ten years from the date of grant and vest over three or four years we granted these options with an exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant we have also offered to our personnel including officers and directors the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan or espp 

  

prior to july 1 2005 we applied apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations in accounting for our equity plans for periods prior to july 1 2005 we complied with the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” or sfas 123 no stockbased employee compensation cost was reflected in net income as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the 

  

 35  

underlying common stock on the date of grant or within permitted discounted prices as it pertains to the espp results for periods before july 1 2005 have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of sfas no 123r “share based payment” or sfas 123r while our financial statements through june 30 2005 account for stock option grants pursuant to apb no 25 in accordance with sfas no 123 we disclose in the notes to our financial statements the pro forma impact on our net income had we accounted for stock option grants using the fair value based method of accounting 

  

as of july 1 2005 we adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation expense of all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and amortization of the fair value over the vesting period of the award under the prospective method the provisions of sfas 123r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption in addition the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption determined under the original provisions of sfas no 123 shall be recognized in net income in the periods after adoption the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes valuation model which is consistent with valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 123 as amended by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the graded attribution method for stockbased awards granted prior to july 1 2005 and the straightline method for stockbased awards granted after july 1 2005 

  

the application of sfas 123r had the following effect on reported amounts relative to amounts that would have been reported under previous accounting in thousands except per share data 

  



  

 36  

the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under our espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model with the following weighted average assumptions 

  



  

expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and implied volatilities from traded options of our stock the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 

  

the guidance in sfas no 123r is relatively new and best practices are not well established the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time there are significant differences among option valuation models and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models methods and assumptions if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 123r in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the compensation expense that we record in the future under sfas no 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income net income and net income per share 

  

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal year 2006 2005 and 2004 during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 323 and approximately 339 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the level of nondeductible expenses and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 we made the decision to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries to take advantage of a temporary incentive under the american jobs creation act of 2004 this temporary incentive provides an 85 exclusion from us taxable income for qualifying dividends received from controlled foreign corporations the repatriation of 75 million resulted in a onetime additional income tax expense of 35 million for the year ended june 30 2006 the repatriation of these funds to the united states provides us with increased flexibility in the utilization of cash to further its strategic objectives 

  

 37  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

was primarily the result of the increase in net income and improved working capital management in addition cash generated from operations for the year end june 30 2006 was reduced by 98 million due to the initial adoption of sfas 123r as tax benefits associated with employee stock options exercised during the year are required to be included within cash flows from financing activities prior to the adoption of sfas 123r cash retained as a result of tax deductions relating to stockbased compensation was presented in operating cash flows along with other tax cash flows 

  

capital expenditures for the years ended june 30 2006 and 2005 aggregated 1027 million and 397 million respectively the capital expenditures in the year ended june 30 2006 primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing research and development building purchase of land in san diego office facilities computer hardware and software rental and loan equipment and purchase of production tooling equipment and machinery as a result of these capital expenditures our balance sheet reflects net property plant and equipment of approximately 2454 million at june 30 2006 compared to 1742 million at june 30 2005 

  

we are currently building our new research and development and office facilities at our existing site in sydney australia and expect to have this completed in september 2006 we estimate that the additional building and fitout costs for the new research and development and office facilities will be approximately 129 million we expect to fund the project through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances contingencies and stockbased compensation costs 

  

 45  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is 

  

 46  

not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force we do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such shipments our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations 

  

7 stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas 123r we measure the compensation of all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including the type of awards employee class and historical experience actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas123r3 “transition election to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards” this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additionalpaidincapital pool as prescribed in sfas 123r or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp we have made a onetime election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas11511241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments the guidance in this fsp amends fasb statements no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and fasb statements no 124 “accounting for certain investments held by notforprofit organizations” and apb opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” we adopted this fsp during the fiscal year ended june 30 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and 

  

 47  

measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no 48 requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than 50 probability threshold it also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no 48 is effective for us beginning july 1 2007 we are assessing the potential impact that the adoption of fin no 48 will have on our financial statements

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep called apneas and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the us alone this represents approximately 43 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many health care professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases recent studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of 

  

 4  

patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 60 of stroke patients and approximately 50 of patients with congestive heart failure more recently studies have shown a connection between sdb and diabetes recent reports indicate that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns maybe monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels simpler tests using devices such as our apnealink or our automatic positive airway pressure devices monitor airflow during sleep and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 3000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

existing therapies 

  

before 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway implanting a device to add support to the soft palate or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow 

  

 5  

generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used rather than a nasal interface 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable patient interface systems delay timers which gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and auto titration devices which reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask contains an inflatable air pocket which conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal in 2002 we introduced the autoset spirit flow generator our secondgeneration autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat osa in 2003 we introduced the mirage activa nasal mask with active cushion technology to automatically seal mask leaks in 2004 we introduced the mirage swift nasal pillows system a less obtrusive lightweight and flexible alternative to nasal masks we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 13 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2005 we invested 300 million or 7 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 60 countries to sleep clinics home health care dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation 

  

during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we donated 05 million 05 million and nil respectively to the resmed foundation in the united states and the resmed foundation limited in australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

 6  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs recent studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure research also indicates that sdb is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance we have developed a device for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology 

  

leverage the experience of our management team and medical advisory board our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular our medical advisory board is comprised of experts in the field of sdb we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories 

  

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface either a small nasal mask nasal pillows system or fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators accounted for approximately 49 50 and 53 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

 7  

with the recent acquisition of saime we have increased our presence in the european homecare ventilation market the vs and elisée range of products are sophisticated yet easy to use for physicians clinicians and patients we believe these devices complement our vpap iii and autoset cs2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance

accessories and other products 

  

to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire h2i and h3i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits map also offers a range of accessories including the twister remote an intelligent remote control for use in the sleep laboratory environment to set and monitor flow generators the aeroclick connection system which allows a quick simple connectdisconnect between the mask and cpap air delivery source and the aerofix headgear for the comfortable adjustment of masks for cpap therapy since the may 2002 acquisition of servo magnetics inc we have sold custom electric motors primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications but we do not expect custom electric motor sales to contribute material revenues in the future 

  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications for example in 1997 we introduced the mirage mask this mask was based on the innovative bubble mask technology introduced in 1991 which used the principle of air inflation of the mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by better conforming to patient facial contours 

  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in september 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology which automatically seals mask leaks in august 2004 we launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the us only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea and also launched our mirage swift mask a light and unobtrusive nasal cannula mask system 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke congestive heart failure and diabetes we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom italy swtizerland and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these physicians currently serve on our medical advisory board new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients typically our internal development staff then develop these ideas where appropriate into new products 

  

in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 we invested 300 million 262 million and 205 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 60 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach 

  

 13  

to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home health care dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home health care dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists regional sales directors and independent manufacturers’ representatives our united states field sales organization markets and sells products to home health care dealer branch locations throughout the united states our direct sales force receives a base salary plus commissions while our independent sales representatives receive higher commissions but no base salary 

  

we also promote and market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home health care dealer to fill the prescription the home health care dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level 

  

in the united states our sales employees and manufacturers’ representatives are managed by the chief operating officer americas and vice president of marketing our canadian and latin american sales are conducted through independent distributors sales in north and latin america accounted for 51 49 and 48 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

europe we market our products in most major european countries we have whollyowned subsidiaries in austria finland france germany spain sweden switzerland and united kingdom we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country in which we have a subsidiary a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales in many countries in europe we sell our products to home health care dealers who then sell the products to the patients in germany we also operate a home health care company in which we provide products and services directly to patients and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers 

  

our european chief operating officer is responsible for coordination of all european activities and in conjunction with local management the direct sales activity in europe sales in europe accounted for 41 43 and 42 of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

asia pacific marketing in asia pacific and the rest of the world is the responsibility of our senior vice president sales  marketing asia pacific we have wholly–owned subsidiaries in australia hong kong japan malaysia new zealand and singapore we use a combination of direct sales force and independent distributors in australia and new zealand and use independent distributors to sell our products elsewhere in asia pacific sales in asia pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 8 8 and 10 of our total net revenues for the fiscal years ended june 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

other marketing efforts in addition to our and our distributors’ sales efforts we work with the following cardiovascular disease associations to raise awareness of the comorbidity of sdb in 

  

 14  

cardiovascular disease patients cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease congestive heart failure hypertension and stroke 

  

i american college of cardiology we work with the american college of cardiology and its more than 20000 cardiologist members to increase education and awareness in the cardiology community regarding the morbidity associated with sleep apnea in their patients we have cosponsored educational symposia with guidant corp at acc in 2003 and acc 2004 on sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease we have exhibited at acc national conferences since 2001 sleep apnea was included in the formal acc scientific sessions in 2004 

  

ii american heart association we have worked with the american heart association and we have attended the annual scientific sessions since 2001 sleep apnea has been on the official program of the scientific sessions since 2002 we work with various regional and local aha affiliates to increase awareness regarding sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease 

  

iii heart failure society of america we have attended the heart failure society of america national conferences since 2002 we have cosponsored cmelevel educational symposia with guidant at hfsa 2003 and hfsa 2004 on sleep apnea and heart failure we continue to see a very high level of interest amongst heart failure physicians due to the significant approximately 50 prevalence of sleep apnea in heart failure patients and the outcome improvements in blood pressure and ejection fraction observed in peerreviewed studies using cpap treatment 

  

strategic alliances 

  

guidant corporation  the guidant corporation is a world leader in the treatment of cardiac and vascular disease guidant and resmed have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the companies will work together in the areas of sleepdisordered breathing and cardiac rhythm disorders disease states with a significant patient population overlap the companies plan to comarket to each other’s physician partners and customers and to collaborate on research and development projects clinical studies as well as physician and patient education 

  

medcath corporation medcath develops owns and operates hospitals in partnership with cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons our alliance allows medcath to offer sdb screening diagnosis and treatment in conjunction with services currently offered through the company’s cardiovascular diagnostic centers 

  

we believe that our affiliations and continued work with these organizations raises the awareness of sdb as a significant health concern 

  

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprises a 215000 square foot manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 en46001 european medical standards fda quality system regulations for medical devices 21 cfr part 820 and the 

  

 15  

medical device directive 9342eec our sydney australia facility is accredited to iso 9001 and en46001 and our san diego california facility is accredited to iso 9002 and en46002 these two sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

our german manufacturing operation based in munich operates in a facility of approximately 24000 square feet this facility is accredited to iso 9001 and en46001 and primarily assembles and tests flow generators for sale by our german subsidiary appropriate quality controls monitor and measure product assembly and performance 

  

as part of the acquisition of saime sa on may 19 2005 we also acquired a new 7000 square feet manufacturing facility this facility is accredited to iso 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of the saime brand of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories 

  

we also manufacture high quality electric motors for both our flow generator devices and external customers primarily in the data storage and aerospace sectors at our servo magnetics inc or “smi” facility at canoga park california the smi facility is approximately 35500 square feet 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs in germany we receive payments directly from these payers outside germany although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home health care dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed health care or legislative proposals to reform health care could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and could result in lower prices for our products 

  

even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

  

 16  

in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear and twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home health care dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than ourselves in the united states our principal market respironics inc devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc and nellcor puritan bennett a subsidiary of tyco inc and fisher  paykell healthcare corporation limited are the primary competitors for our cpap products our principal european competitors are also respironics devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the health care industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive which would harm our revenues and financial condition 

  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited medizintechnik fur arzt und patient gmbh smi and saime sa we own or have licensed rights to 192 issued united states patents including 56 design patents and 242 issued foreign patents in addition there are 182 pending united states patent applications including 41 design patent applications 369 pending foreign patent applications 312 registered foreign designs and 107 pending foreign designs some of these patents patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products 

  

of our patents nine united states patents and four foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with one foreign patent due to expire in each of the years 2005 2007 2009 and 2010 and one united states patent in 2005 two united states patents in 2007 four united states patents in 2008 and two united states patents in 2010 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

 17  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and regulations of relevant foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma before introducing it into the us market our products currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for highrisk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements map’s and saime’s facilities are not subject to fda regulation because none of their products are currently marketed in the united states 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in the united states with fda in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

 18  

on august 16 2005 the us food and drug administration authorized resmed to market its vpap adapt sv device in the united states the device is indicated for use to provide noninvasive ventilatory support to treat adult patients with osa and respiratory insufficiency caused by central andor mixed apneas and periodic breathing resmed does not expect to sell material quantities of the vpap adapt sv until the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 or later 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2005 we had 1927 employees or full time consultants of which 728 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 255 in research and development 944 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants 952 were located in australia 429 in the united states 530 in europe and 16 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

business acquisitions 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2005 

  

saime sa “saime” on may 19 2005 we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of financiere ace sas the holding company for saime sa and its affiliates for net cash consideration of 405 million this was comprised of 510 million in consideration including acquisition costs less 105 million of cash acquired additionally as part of the acquisition we assumed and immediately repaid debt of 658 million the acquisition and the immediate repayment of the assumed debt was funded with cash on hand and a fiveyear secured loan of 50 million euro equivalent to 627 million from hsbc bank australia limited 

  

saime is a leading developer of ventilation products and distributes its products directly in france and germany and through a network of distributors in europe and asiapacific 

  

the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been included in the company’s operations since the date of acquisition the company has not yet completed the purchase price allocation as the appraisals associated with the valuation of certain tangible assets are not yet complete the company does not believe that the appraisals will materially modify the preliminary purchase price allocation we expect to complete our purchase price allocation in the six months ended december 31 2005 

  

 26  

the following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from saime at the date of acquisition based on an independent appraisal and internal studies in thousands 

  



  

since its formation in 1987 saime has developed a complete range of ventilators for use in the home and hospital markets saime distributes its products directly in france and germany and through a network of distributors in europe and asia pacific saime develops manufactures and markets products from its headquarters near paris with a staff of approximately 100 

  

the company believes that the saime acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill primarily because of its industry position and management strength in addition saime’s products complete our line of homecare ventilation products and will immediately expand our market presence and distribution network in europe and other regions the saime devices will complement our vpapiii and autoset cs devices and will allow us to provide the full range of options for patients who need ventilatory assistance 

  

hoefner medizintechnick gmbh “hoefner”   on february 14 2005 we acquired 100 of the outstanding stock of hoefner medizintechnick gmbh “hoefner” for net cash consideration of 82 million this was comprised of the 107 million in total consideration including acquisition costs less 25 million of cash acquired under the purchase agreement we may also be required to make additional future payments of up to 09 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones following the acquisition through december 31 2006 hoefner is a germanbased company that distributes medical equipment and associated services for the treatment of sleep and respiratory patients hoefner was our bavarian distributor before the acquisition and the acquisition is consistent with our strategy for ongoing expansion of our international operations we have been particularly successful in selling directly in europe we believe selling directly improves our understanding of local markets as well as our relationships with physicians and payers the acquisition also brings us into closer contact with patients and allows us to more directly respond to their needs 

  

 27  

the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been included within our consolidated financial statements from february 14 2005 an amount of 82 million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of 25 million has been recorded as goodwill 

  

the cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition the fair values were determined by an independent appraisal and internal studies the following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from hoefner at the date of acquisition in thousands 

  



  

resprecare bv on december 1 2004 we acquired substantially all the assets of resprecare bv our dutch distributor for initial consideration of 59 million in cash including acquisition costs the acquisition of the exclusive dutch distributor is consistent with our strategy for ongoing expansion of our international operations under the purchase agreement we potentially were also required to make up to 14 million of additional future payments based on the achievement of certain milestones of these potential additional payments 06 million was paid in january 2005 as a result of the successful achievement of a performance milestone and a further 07 million was accrued at june 30 2005 as a result of the integration of the dutch subsidiary of our subsidiary map with the newlyacquired resprecare business the decision to integrate these operations determined the amount of the final future payment which will be paid in january 2006 

  

the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly the results of operations of resprecare have been included within our consolidated financial statements from december 1 2004 an amount of 44 million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of 28 million has been recorded as goodwill which will be tax deductible an independent third party has completed a valuation of identifiable intangible assets associated with the resprecare acquisition as a result of this valuation 17 million that was preliminarily allocated to goodwill has been recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and is being amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years 

  

 28  

we expect that the acquisitions of resprecare hoefner and saime will not have a significant impact on the historical relationship of our gross profit selling general and administrative expense and research and development expense expressed as a percentage of our net revenue 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2004 

  

respro medical company limited “respro” on july 2 2003 we acquired the assets of respro medical company limited “respro” our hong kong distributor for total consideration of 184000 in cash the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly the results of operations of respro have been included within our consolidated financial statements from july 2 2003 an amount of 89000 representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of 95000 has been recorded as goodwill

inprocess research and development charge iprd 

  

on acquisition of saime in may 2005 we recognized as an expense a charge of 53 million with respect to iprd programs under active development by saime that at date of acquisition had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use the estimated fair value assigned to iprd was based on an independent appraisal and was comprised of the following projects in thousands 

  



  

the value of iprd was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established estimating the costs to develop the purchased inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products discounting the net cash flows to present value and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto the discount rate used in the analysis was 25 which was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets 

  

as of the date of acquisition these projects have estimated costs to complete totaling approximately 11 million the projects were in various stages of development but are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 1 to 3 years 

  

we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets were reasonable at the time of acquisition no assurance can be given however that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues development costs or profitability or events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated for these reasons among others actual results may vary from the projected results

tax expense 

  

our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 31 and approximately 33 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the level of nondeductible expenses and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2005 to 1357 million from 1047 million for the year ended june 30 2004 an increase of 310 million or 30 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2005 was 32 marginally higher than 31 in the year ended june 30 2004 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel to support our growth the acquisitions of resprecare hoefner and saime continued infrastructure investment particularly in our european businesses and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 40 million to our expenses as reported in us dollars as a percentage of net revenue we expect our future selling general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 31 to 33 

  

donations to foundations in the years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 we donated 05 million and 05 million respectively to the resmed foundation in the us and the resmed foundation limited in australia the foundation’s overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease

inprocess research and development charge purchased inprocess research and development of 53 million was expensed upon acquisition of saime as technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed the nature of this charge is explained more fully in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements

other income expense net other expense net for the year ended june 30 2005 was 07 million consistent with the year ended june 30 2004 in fiscal year 2005 other expense net reflected lower net foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest expense due to the reduction in our convertible note debt that occurred in the 2004 fiscal year 

  

 31  

income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to approximately 33 for the year ended june 30 2005 from approximately 32 for the year ended june 30 2004 however adding back the impact of the nondeductible inprocess research and development charge of 53 million taken in the year ended june 30 2005 would result in an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31 the lower adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to our geographical mix of taxable income in particular we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 and certain australian rd tax benefits because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

net income as a result of the factors above our net income for the year ended june 30 2005 was 648 million or 182 per diluted share compared to net income of 573 million or 163 per diluted share for the year ended june 30 2004 the restructuring expenses inprocess research and development charge and amortization of acquired intangible assets described above constituted a reduction of 024 and 000 per diluted share on an aftertax basis respectively for the years ended june 30 2005 and 2004

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to 1047 million from 853 million for the year ended june 30 2003 an increase of 194 million or 23 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2004 was 31 consistent with the year 

  

 32  

ended june 30 2003 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 81 million to our expenses as reported in us dollars 

  

donations to foundation in the year ended june 30 2004 we donated 05 million to the resmed foundation in the us and the resmed foundation limited in australia the foundation’s overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease

the appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar added approximately 38 million to our research and development expenses as reported in us dollars 

  

other income expense net other expense net increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to net expense of 07 million from net expense of 01 million for the year ended june 30 2003 the increase in other expense was attributable to no gains on extinguishment of debt this year compared to 05 million for the year ended june 30 2003 and lower net foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest expense due to the reduction in convertible note debt 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to 323 for the year ended june 30 2004 from 319 for the year ended june 30 2003 the marginally higher tax rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of taxable income we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of june 30 2005 and june 30 2004 we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities availableforsale of 1422 million and 1409 million respectively working capital was 1417 million and 2222 million at june 30 2005 and june 30 2004 respectively the reduction in working capital predominantly reflects the classification of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due june 20 2006 from a non current liability as at june 30 2004 to a current liability as at june 30 2005 

  

inventories at june 30 2005 increased by 333 million or 60 to 891 million compared to june 30 2004 inventories of 558 million excluding the incremental inventories from acquisitions our inventories increased by 220 million or 39 this percentage increase in inventories was higher than the increase of 25 in revenues in the year ended june 30 2005 compared to the year ended june 30 2004 the higher inventory growth reflects management’s decision to increase inventory levels particularly in raw materials to accommodate our increasing production volumes in addition to this raw material inventories have increased to support production of our recently launched s8 flow generator accounts receivable at june 30 2005 were 1040 million an increase of 368 

  

 33  

million or 55 over the june 30 2004 accounts receivable balance of 672 million excluding the incremental increase from acquisitions our accounts receivables have increased by 273 million or 41 this increase was higher than the 25 incremental increase in revenues for the year ended june 30 2005 compared to the year ended june 30 2004 the deterioration in ageing largely reflects higher than normal receivable balances relative to sales in germany as delays in processing of invoices have also resulted in timing of collections being delayed accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 71 days for the year ended june 30 2005 compared to 64 days for the year ended june 30 2004 our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30 2005 and 2004 was 30 and 45 respectively the credit quality of our customers remains consistent with our past experience 

  

during the year ended june 30 2005 we generated cash of 711 million from operations this was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30 2004 of 765 million and primarily reflects the increase in inventory and receivables attributable to the factors described above 

  

capital expenditures for the years ended june 30 2005 and 2004 aggregated 397 million and 572 million respectively for the year ended june 30 2005 235 million of the expenditure related to the construction of our new manufacturing facility the capital expenditures in the year ended june 30 2005 primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing research and development building office facilities computer hardware and software rental and loan equipment and purchase of production tooling equipment and machinery as a result of these capital expenditures our balance sheet reflects net property plant and equipment of approximately 1742 million at june 30 2005 compared to 1473 million at june 30 2004 

  

we are currently building our new research and development and office facilities at our existing site in sydney australia and expect this to be completed by the second half of calendar 2006 we estimate that the additional building costs for the new research and development and office facilities will be approximately 490 million we expect to fund the project through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 

  

on may 16 2005 we obtained a fiveyear loan of 50 million euro equivalent to 627 million from hsbc bank australia limited to fund the acquisition of saime sa

during the year ended june 30 2005 we did not repurchase any convertible subordinated notes our convertible subordinated notes are due to mature on june 20 2006 

  

we may from time to time seek to retire our convertible subordinated notes through cash purchases andor exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and our current or future contractual obligations if any that may directly or indirectly apply to such transactions 

  

the results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations we are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes deferred tax valuation allowances and contingencies 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which 

  

 35  

results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill intangibles and other longlived assets the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes 

  

 36  

we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force we do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such shipments our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 123r “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas 123 generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative this statement also eliminates the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using apb opinion no 25 the statement which was delayed is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued the accounting provision sfas 123r is effective beginning in our interim period ending september 30 2005 

  

sfas 123r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 1 a “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all awards granted to employees before the effective date of sfas 123r that remain unvested on the effective date or 2 a “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption we expect to adopt the modified prospective method 

  

as permitted by sfas 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options which are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant we are currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of sfas 123r however we expect the adoption of sfas 123r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29’ accounting for nonmonetary transactions’” the amendments are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 however earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance the provisions of this statement will be applied prospectively we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 151 “inventory costs” which sought to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and spoilage sfas 151 also requires that the allocation of fixed 

  

 37  

production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal operating capacity of the production facilities sfas 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

foreign currency market risk 

  

our functional currency is the us dollar although the financial statements of our nonus subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies we transact business in various foreign currencies including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 

  

we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and manufacturing expenditure the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lockin the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in euro’s and the australian dollar under this program increases or decreases in our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments we have determined our hedge program to be a noneffective hedge as defined under sfas 133 the foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities all movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income net on our consolidated statements of income

the table below provides information in us dollars on our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets by legal entity functional currency as of june 30 2005 in thousands

the table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and presents the information in us dollar equivalents the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates including foreign currency call options held at june 30 2005 the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments these notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the options contracts 

  



  

interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt at june 30 2005 we had total longterm debt including the current portion of those obligations of 1744 million of this debt 1139 million is at fixed interest rates and 605 million is subject to variable interest rates 

  

a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates during the twelve months ended june 30 2005 would not have a material impact on pretax income we have no interest rate hedging agreements 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

this report on form 10k contains or may contain certain forwardlooking statements and information that are based on our management’s beliefs as well as on estimates and assumptions made by and information currently available to our management the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “plan” “future” and other similar expressions generally identify forwardlooking statements including in particular statements regarding the development and approval of new products and product applications market expansion pending litigation and the development of new markets for our products such as the cardiovascular and stroke markets these forwardlooking statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should not unduly rely on these forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect the views of our management at the time the statements are made and are subject to a number of risks uncertainties estimates and assumptions including without limitation and in addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements those identified under the caption “risk factors” below and elsewhere in this report in addition important factors to consider in evaluating such forwardlooking statements include changes or developments in social economic market legal or regulatory circumstances changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy generally the emergence of 

  

 40  

new or growing competitors the actions or omissions of third parties including suppliers customers competitors and governmental authorities and various other factors should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or the underlying estimates or assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary significantly from those expressed in such forwardlooking statements and there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements contained in this report will in fact occur 

  

risk factors 

  

the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition or results of operations include the following 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop manufacture and market innovative new products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home health care products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders we believe that home health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to approximately 3000 us sleep clinics and the more than 6000 home health care dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement have declined for home care products and home health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleep disordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products 

  

any inability to effectively market our products outside the us could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us in approximately 60 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments if we are unable to effectively market our products outside the us our overall financial performance could decline 

  

 41  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer   during the fiscal year ended june 30 2005 we acquired saime sa hoefner and resprecare we are currently in the process of integrating our operations with these recent acquisitions the integration will require significant efforts from each company we may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies this diversion or these difficulties in integration could have an adverse impact on us if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

  

if we fail to properly implement restructure plans our business could suffer we recently merged the operations of resmed germany and map into a single operating unit as part of our german restructure plan we have relocated our resmed germany operations to munich and are integrating the back office functions including customer service logistics and administration we will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies cost savings and success if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the restructure 

  

changes in assumptions used in the purchase accounting of our recent acquisitions may impact our future operating results the acquisitions have been accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly have been included in the company’s operations since the date of acquisition we allocate the purchase price according to the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed intangible assets and in process research and development as at the date of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of acquired net assets is recorded as goodwill we utilize independent appraisals with our own internal studies and management assumptions to estimate the fair values if our estimates change due to inaccurate assumptions or other circumstances our future financial results maybe impacted this may result in goodwill becoming impaired and changes to the amount of amortization charges of certain identifiable intangible assets 

  

we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets subjecting us to various risks relating to international activities that could adversely affect our overall profitability sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 49 51 and 52 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

 42  

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia and the united kingdom there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights may harm our business 

  

as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing in the united states we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and medicare 

  

in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines 

  

 43  

in addition to reimbursement for our products our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products during fiscal year 2004 the us government proposed reductions in reimbursement rates for some of these other products such proposed reductions if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 

  

complying with food and drug administration and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees a recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation and materially affect operating results 

  

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the 510k clearance process we have modified some of our 510k approved products without submitting new 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510k notice additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer 

  

we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part 

  

 44  

a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability 

  

 45  

claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing german tax audit any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 

  

additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders under our stockholder rights plan we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our series a junior participating preferred stock at a discount under certain circumstances the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be 

  

 46  

adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally two of our eight directors and two of our six executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts

general 

  

we are a leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating diagnosing and managing sleepdisordered breathing or sdb sdb includes obstructive sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep when we were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan this treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure or cpap was the first successful noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air typically through a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep 

  

since the development of cpap we have developed a number of innovative products for sdb including airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion increased awareness of sdb as a significant health concern among physicians and patients and our research and product development effort 

  

we employ 1520 people and sell our products in over 60 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors 

  

our web site address is wwwresmedcom we make our periodic reports together with any amendments available on our web site free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the securities and exchange commission 

  

corporate history 

  

resmed inc a delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our domestic australian and european operating subsidiaries on june 1 1995 we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on june 2 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the nasdaq national market on september 30 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the new york stock exchange nyse trading under the ticker symbol rmd on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our common stock via chess depositary instruments or cdi’s on the australian stock exchange asx also under the symbol rmd ten cdi’s on the asx represent one share of our common stock on the nyse on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing 

  

our australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in 1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty limited or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment as well as baxter’s existing cpap device business baxter had sold cpap devices in australia since 1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987 

  

since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including servo magnetics inc labhardt ag map medizin technologie gmbh dieter w priess medtechnik premium medical sarl innovmedics pte ltd and einar egnell ab on may 14 2002 november 15 2001 february 16 2001 february 7 1996 june 12 1996 november 1 1997 and january 31 2000 respectively during the 1999 fiscal year we made an equity investment in medcare flaga hf medcare based in iceland we now market medcare’s polysomnographic products under the embla and embletta label in selected countries

the market 

  

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest 

  

the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep or apneas or near closures of the upper airways or hypopneas these breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions in addition osa has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart disease stroke and diabetes 

  

scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea in the us alone this represents approximately 43 million people despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is estimated that less than 10 of those with osa have been diagnosed or treated many health care professionals are often unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness snoring hypertension and irritability are characteristic of osa 

  

while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs recently a strong association has been discovered between osa and a number of cardiovascular diseases recent studies have shown that sdb is present in approximately 80 of patients with drugresistant hypertension approximately 60 of stroke patients and approximately 50 of patients with congestive heart failure in addition patients who are being treated for certain other conditions including those undergoing dialysis treatment or suffering from diabetes may have an increased incidence of osa 

  

sleepdisordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea 

  

sleepdisordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease osa is the most common form of sdb 

  

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and irritability osa sufferers also may experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by osa may be associated with 

  

 4  

increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents 

  

generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home during overnight testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns are monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we estimate that there are currently around 5000 sleep clinics in the united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985 

  

existing therapies 

  

prior to 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow most recently surgery has involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or uppp in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway uppp alone has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage upper airway surgical procedures a greater success rate has been claimed these combined procedures performed by highly specialized surgeons are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods 

  

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid 1980’s today use of cpap is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing osa 

  

during cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal mask connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure the patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the mask continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be used 

  

cpap is not a cure and therefore must be used on a daily basis as long as treatment is required patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and convenience patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at the prescribed pressure in more recent years product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include more comfortable mask systems delay timers which gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow generators including vpap systems which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable and auto titration devices which reduce the average pressure delivered during the night 

  

business strategy 

  

we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the 

  

 5  

management of cardiac neurologic metabolic and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of the following key elements 

  

continue product development and innovation we are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat sdb increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask this mask contains an inflatable air pocket which conforms to the patient’s facial contours creating a more comfortable and better seal additionally in 2002 we introduced the autoset spirit flow generator our secondgeneration autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat osa we believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success approximately 15 of our employees are devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2004 we invested 262 million or 8 of our revenues in research and development 

  

expand geographic presence we market our products in over 60 countries to sleep clinics home health care dealers and third party payers we intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions 

  

increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups including the national stroke association the american heart association and the national sleep foundation 

  

during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 we donated 05 million nil and 23 million respectively to the resmed sleep disordered breathing foundations in the united states and australia to further enhance research and awareness of sdb the contributions to the foundations reflect resmed’s commitment to medical research into sleepdisordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 

  

expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs recent studies have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and congestive heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure we have developed a device which has not been approved for sale in the united states for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure currently over 1000 patients are being treated by this device in europe in addition we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology 

  

leverage the experience of our management team and medical advisory board our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in particular our medical advisory board is comprised of experts in the field of sdb we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by sdb 

  

products 

  

our portfolio of products for the treatment of osa and other forms of sdb includes airflow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other accessories

air flow generators 

  

we produce cpap vpap and autoset systems for the diagnosis titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a small nasal mask or sometimes a fullface mask 

  

our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability 

  

autoset systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis treatment and management of osa cpap and vpap flow generators accounted for approximately 50 53 and 55 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

accessories and other products 

  

to enhance patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of other products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the humidaire and h2i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient their use prevents the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers carry bags and breathing circuits map also offers a range of accessories including the twister remote an intelligent remote control for use in the sleep laboratory environment to set and monitor flow generators the aeroclick connection system which allows a quick simple connectdisconnect between the mask and cpap air delivery source and the aerofix headgear for the comfortable adjustment of masks for cpap therapy since the may 2002 acquisition of servo magnetics inc we have sold custom electric motors primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications 

  

product development and clinical trials 

  

we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we introduced our first cpap device since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development currently our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new product applications for example in 1997 we introduced the mirage mask this mask was based on the innovative bubble mask technology introduced in 1991 which used the principle of air inflation of the mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by better conforming to patient facial contours 

  

 10  

in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas in 2001 we introduced our next generation autotitrating device the autoset spirit the autoset spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier in september 2003 we introduced the activa nasal mask using our patented active cushion technology which automatically seals mask leaks recently we also launched an improved autoset cs 2 outside the us only to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea 

  

we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability recent studies have established a clinical association between sdb and hypertension stroke and congestive heart failure we support clinical trials in the united states germany france the united kingdom and australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology 

  

we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these physicians currently serve on our medical advisory board new product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors manufacturers’ representatives customers and patients typically our internal development staff then perform new product development 

  

in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 we invested 262 million 205 million and 149 million respectively on research and development 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we currently market our products in over 60 countries using a network of distributors independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies 

  

north america and latin america our products are typically purchased by a home health care dealer who then sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products as opposed those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician and his or her staff the home health care dealer the insurer and the patient in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives program development specialists regional sales directors and independent manufacturers’ representatives our united states field sales organization markets and sells products to more than 4000 home health care dealer branch locations throughout the united states our direct sales force receives a base salary plus commissions while our independent sales representatives receive higher commissions but no base salary 

  

we also promote and market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home health care dealer to fill the prescription the home health care dealer in consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level in the united states our sales employees and manufacturers’ representatives are managed by two regional sales directors our senior vice president of sales marketing and our chief operating officer for the americas

manufacturing 

  

our principal manufacturing facility is located in sydney australia and comprise a 215000 square feet manufacturing facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams each team is responsible for manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback 

  

our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001 en46001 european medical standards fda quality system regulations for medical devices 21 cfr part 820 and the medical device directive 9342eec our sydney australia facility is accredited to iso 9001 and en46001 and our san diego california facility is accredited to iso 9002 and en46002 these two sites have third party audits conducted by the iso certification bodies at regular intervals 

  

our german manufacturing operation based in munich operates in a facility of approximately 24000 square feet this facility is accredited to iso 9001 and en46001 and primarily assembles and tests flow generators for sale by our subsidiary map gmbh appropriate quality controls monitor and measure product assembly and performance 

  

in addition to our australian and german manufacturing operations we also manufacture high quality electric motors for both our flow generator devices and external customers primarily in the data storage and aerospace sectors at our servo magnetics inc smi facility at canoga park california the smi facility is approximately 35500 square feet 

  

thirdparty reimbursement 

  

the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products 

  

in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home health care dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty payers directly domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed health care or legislative proposals to reform health care could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and could result in lower prices for our products 

  

 13  

even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the united states we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws 

  

in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products however subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa 

  

service and warranty 

  

we generally offer oneyear or twoyear limited warranties on our flow generator products warranties on mask systems are for 90 days in most markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us in the united states home health care dealers generally arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair 

  

we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we provide for warranties and returns based on historical data 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features reliability and price customer support reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors 

  

we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing resources than ourselves in the united states our principal market respironics inc devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc and nellcor puritan bennett a subsidiary of tyco inc are the primary competitors for our cpap products our principal european competitors are also respironics devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the health care industry in addition our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive resulting in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 14  

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are expected to be important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property 

  

patents and proprietary rights and related litigation 

  

through our subsidiaries resmed limited medizintechnik fur arzt und patient gmbh and smi we own or have licensed rights to 142 issued united states patents including 35 design patents and 167 issued foreign patents in addition there are 169 pending united states patent applications including 35 design patent applications 301 pending foreign patent applications 255 registered foreign designs and 45 pending foreign designs some of these patents and patent applications relate to significant aspects and features of our products these include us patents relating to our cpap devices a delay timer system the bubble mask and an automated means of varying air pressure based upon a patient’s changing needs during nightly use such as that employed in our autoset device 

  

of our patents seven united states patents and two foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years with one foreign patent due to expire in each of the years 2005 and 2007 and one united states patent in 2005 two united states patents in 2007 and four united states patents in 2008 we believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

  

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets trade marks and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights 

  

litigation may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country therefore there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

government regulations 

  

our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation or qsr and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united states and regulations of relevant foreign agencies abroad the fda regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution 

  

the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval or pma prior to it being introduced into the us market our products currently 

  

 15  

marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market prior to 1976 or to a device that has been found by the fda to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre1976 device as a result fda approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information 

  

as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with the fda’s regulatory requirements map’s facilities are not subject to fda regulation because none of map’s products are currently marketed in the united states 

  

sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process where appropriate our products are ce marked to the european union’s medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in the united states with fda in australia with the therapeutic goods administration or tga and in canada with health canada 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2004 we had 1520 employees or full time consultants of which 599 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing 225 in research and development 696 in sales marketing and administration of our employees and consultants 740 were located in australia 382 in the united states 387 in europe and 11 in asia 

  

we believe that the success of our business will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

on july 2 2003 we acquired the assets of respro medical company limited “respro” our hong kong distributor for total consideration of 184000 in cash the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the results of operations of respro have been included within our consolidated financial statements from july 2 2003 an amount of 89000 representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of 95000 has been recorded as goodwill

fiscal year ended june 30 2002 

  

labhardt acquisition on november 15 2001 we acquired all the common stock of labhardt ag our swiss distributor for total cash consideration including acquisition costs of 55 million 

  

the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the results of operations of labhardt ag have been included in our consolidated financial statements from november 15 2001 an amount of 42 million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of 13 million has been recorded as goodwill 

  

smi acquisition on may 14 2002 we acquired all of the common stock of servo magnetics incorporated “smi” through a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary servo magnetics acquisition inc for total consideration including acquisition costs of 326 million consideration included the issue of 853448 shares for fair value of 248 million with the balance of the acquisition price paid in cash upon consummation of the merger the surviving corporation servo magnetics acquisition inc changed its name to servo magnetics inc 

  

 23  

the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the results of operations of smi have been included in our consolidated financial statements from may 14 2002 an amount of 307 million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of 19 million has been recorded as goodwill 

  

purchased inprocess research and development of 04 million was expensed upon acquisition of smi because technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed the value of inprocess technology was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products discounting the net cash flows to present value and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto the discount rate used in the analysis was 19 and was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets 

  

purchased research and development projects related to electrical motor systems used in our flow generator devices and other medical and data storage equipment key assumptions used in the analysis included gross margins of 34 the majority of the new motor systems have been completed and have performed in line with expectations at the time of acquisition 

  

inprocess research and development charge 

  

on acquisition of map medizintechnologie gmbh map in february 2001 we recognized as an expense a charge of 177 million with respect to five inprocess research and development programs under active development by map at date of acquisition the five projects were 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the status of each project as of june 30 2004 is noted below 

  

   

the nasal cushion under development by map on acquisition was originally due for release in october 2001 delays in the design and manufacturing process delayed the release for seven months until april 2002 the delay in release of the product was not significant over its expected life cycle and has made no significant impact on the net return assumptions used in the initial inprocess research and development model since release the product now referred to as the papillon has met or exceeded all sales forecasts 

  

   

the new headgear product line was withheld to coincide with the release of the papillon mask system in april 2002 and so was also seven months behind schedule in projected release dates since release the new headgear system has exceeded original sales projections and continues to meet or exceed initial expectations 

  

   

due to other priorities and to the introduction of integrated humidification flow generator devices by a number of competitors during fiscal 2002 we have abandoned the standalone humidifier project 

  

 24  

given the relatively small revenue forecast of the product line in the inprocess research and development model the financial impact of this project is not material to resmed or the net return of the map acquisition 

  

   

the main product development effort of map since acquisition has been on the completion of the autotitration cpap flow generator specified in the initial inprocess research and development charge now referred to as the magellan this project experienced some delays due to the complexity of the software algorithm development process and associated electronics resulting in the product being released in november 2002 sales are now broadly consistent with our initial expectations 

  

   

map’s new diagnostic screening device now called the micromesam was released in the german market in march 2004 we remain confident in the capacity of the device to enhance the diagnostic process and remain confident in the potential of the product to significantly impact the treatment and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in the german market 

  

as at june 30 2004 four of the five programs have been completed with the release of the papillon mask system upgraded headgear magellan flow generator and micromesam 

  

given the completion of the above research programs and performance of the associated product lines we remain confident in the assumptions used to determine the inprocess research and development charge and as a result the net return of the map acquisition 

  

tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 31 and approximately 33 these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the level of nondeductible expenses and the use of available net operating loss carryforward deductions and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

  

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2004 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2003 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to 3393 million from 2736 million for the year ended june 30 2003 an increase of 657 million or 24 

  

the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators masks and accessories sales also benefited from an appreciation of international currencies against the 

  

 25  

us dollar increasing sales by approximately 186 million net revenue in north and latin america increased to 1661 million from 1307 million for the years ended june 30 2004 and 2003 respectively this growth primarily reflects increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing net revenue in international markets increased to 1732 million from 1428 million for the years ended june 30 2004 and 2003 respectively international sales growth for the year ended june 30 2004 reflects organic growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar sales for the previous year ended june 30 2003 included nonrecurring sarsrelated sales to china of approximately 50 million excluding the impact of these sales international sales grew by 26 excluding both the impacts of the appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar and sarsrelated sales international sales grew by 12 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2004 increased by 18 compared to the year ended june 30 2003 including increases of 20 in north and latin america and 16 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories increased by 31 including increases of 33 in north and latin america and 29 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2004 compared to the year ended june 30 2003 these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to 2167 million from 1731 million for the year ended june 30 2003 an increase of 436 million or 25 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to 64 from 63 for the year ended june 30 2003 the small improvement in gross margin reflects a more favorable product mix due to increased sales of higher margin products partially offset by the impact of higher manufacturing costs resulting from a stronger australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of manufacturing labor and overhead costs are incurred in australia 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to 1047 million from 853 million for the year ended june 30 2003 an increase of 194 million or 23 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2004 was 31 consistent with the year ended june 30 2003 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar which added approximately 81 million to our expenses as reported in us dollars 

  

donations to foundation in the year ended june 30 2004 we donated 05 million to the resmed sleep disordered breathing foundation the foundation’s overall mission is to educate both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease 

  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to 262 million from 205 million for the year ended june 30 2003 an increase of 57 million or 28 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 77 for the year ended june 30 2004 compared to 75 for the year ended june 30 2003 the increase in research and development expenses was due to increased salaries associated with an increase in personnel and increased charges for consulting fees clinical trials and technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products the increase also reflects an appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of research and development costs are incurred in australian dollars the appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar added approximately 38 million to our research and development expenses as reported in us dollars 

  

 26  

other income expense net other expense net increased for the year ended june 30 2004 to net expense of 07 million from net expense of 01 million for the year ended june 30 2003 the increase in other expense was attributable to no gains on extinguishment of debt this year compared to 05 million for the year ended june 30 2003 and lower net foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest expense due to the reduction in convertible note debt 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to 323 for the year ended june 30 2004 from 319 for the year ended june 30 2003 the marginally higher tax rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of taxable income we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

fiscal year ended june 30 2003 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2002 

  

net revenues net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 2736 million from 2041 million for the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of 695 million or 34 

  

the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators and accessories sales also benefited from an appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar increasing sales by approximately 168 million and inclusion of sales of 65 million from servo magnetics inc smi the subsidiary we acquired in may 2002 net revenue in north and latin america increased to 1307 million from 1009 million for the years ended june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively this growth primarily reflects increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing net revenue in international markets increased to 1428 million from 1031 million for the years ended june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively international sales growth for the year ended june 30 2003 reflects organic growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar and sarsrelated sales to china of approximately 50 million 

  

sales of flow generators for the year ended june 30 2003 increased by 29 compared to the year ended june 30 2002 including increases of 23 in north and latin america and 33 elsewhere sales of mask systems motors and other accessories increased by 40 including increases of 35 in north and latin america and 47 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2003 compared to the year ended june 30 2002 these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar and our acquisition of smi 

  

gross profit gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 1731 million from 1332 million for the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of 399 million or 30 gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 63 from 65 for the year ended june 30 2002 reflecting the impact of higher manufacturing costs resulting from a stronger australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of manufacturing labor and overhead costs are incurred in australia and to a lesser extent the inclusion of smi’s motor sales which achieve lower margins compared to our overall gross margin 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 853 million from 645 million for the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of 208 million or 32 as a percentage of net revenue selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30 2003 decreased to 31 compared to 32 for the year ended june 30 2002 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses related to the increase in our sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the us dollar adding approximately 60 million the inclusion of 26 million from smi’s operations and 22 million in litigation costs associated with outstanding patent infringement lawsuits against competitors 

  

 27  

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 205 million from 149 million for the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of 56 million or 38 as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses were 75 for the year ended june 30 2003 compared to 73 for the year ended june 30 2002 the increase in research and development expenses was due to increased salaries associated with an increase in personnel and increased charges for consulting fees clinical trials and technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products the increase also reflects an appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar as the majority of research and development costs are incurred in australian dollars in constant currency terms research and development expenses for the year ended june 30 2003 increased by 31 million or 17 compared to the year ended june 30 2002 

  

other income expense net other income expense net decreased for the year ended june 30 2003 to net expense of 01 million from net income of 34 million for the year ended june 30 2002 the decrease in other income was attributable to lower gains on extinguishment of debt partially offset by increased net foreign currency exchange gains and lower interest expense due to the reduction in convertible note debt 

  

income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to 319 for the year ended june 30 2003 from 313 for the year ended june 30 2002 the marginally higher tax rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of taxable income we continue to benefit from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 because we generate a majority of our taxable income in australia 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of june 30 2004 and june 30 2003 we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities availableforsale of 1409 million and 1210 million respectively working capital was 2172 million and 1913 million at june 30 2004 and june 30 2003 respectively 

  

inventories at june 30 2004 increased by 64 million or 13 to 558 million compared to june 30 2003 inventories of 494 million the percentage increase in inventories was less than the 24 incremental increase in revenues in the year ended june 30 2004 compared to the year ended june 30 2003 the lower inventory growth reflects the impact of the relocation of manufacturing to our new facility at norwest in sydney in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 which temporarily lowered production volumes and consequently inventory balances at june 30 2004 accounts receivable at june 30 2004 were 672 million an increase of 105 million or 19 over the june 30 2003 accounts receivable balance of 567 million this increase was modestly lower than the 24 incremental increase in revenues for the year ended june 30 2004 compared to the year ended june 30 2003 accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 64 days for the quarter ended june 30 2004 compared to 62 days for the quarter ended june 30 2003 the increase reflected in part sarsrelated sales to china of 50 million in the quarter ended june 30 2003 which were collected prior to june 30 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30 2004 and 2003 was 45 and 42 respectively the credit quality of our customers remains consistent with our past experience

 28  

construction of our new manufacturing facility capital expenditure was also incurred for the acquisition of computer hardware and software and the purchase of production tooling and equipment the capital expenditures in the year ended june 30 2003 primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing facility acquisition of computer hardware and software including a disaster recovery system and purchase of production tooling equipment as a result of these capital expenditures our balance sheet reflects net property plant and equipment of approximately 1473 million at june 30 2004 compared to 1047 million at june 30 2003 

  

during the year ended june 30 2004 we did not repurchase any convertible subordinated notes

we may from time to time seek to retire our convertible subordinated notes through cash purchases andor exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases or exchanges if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements and our current or future contractual obligations if any that may directly or indirectly apply to such transactions 

  

on april 26 2002 we settled our purchase of a 30acre site at norwest business park located northwest of sydney australia the acquisition cost was 236 million including deferred payments of 57 million paid in october 2002 and 57 million paid in april 2003 we completed the first building a manufacturing facility on this site in may 2004 new research and development and office facilities are expected to be completed in may 2006 we estimate that the additional building costs for the new research and development and office facilities will be approximately 54 million we expect to fund the project through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations

details of other commercial commitments at june 30 2004 are as follows 

  



  

   

the results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations we are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates we manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts 

  

we expect to satisfy all of our short term and longterm liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand cash generated from operations and a 150 million undrawn revolving line of credit with union bank of california 

  

critical accounting principles and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves warranty obligations goodwill impaired assets intangible assets income taxes and contingencies 

  

we state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

  

1 allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments which results in bad debt expense we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering a customer’s financial condition credit history and current economic conditions if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

2 inventory adjustments inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the firstin firstout method we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales the likelihood of any material inventory writedowns is dependent on changes in competitive conditions new product introductions by us or our competitors or rapid changes in customer demand 

  

 30  

3 valuation of goodwill intangible and other longlived assets we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives of our longlived assets and goodwill the criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends significant changes in our strategic business objectives utilization of the asset and a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in certain countries 

  

4 valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 

  

5 provision for warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision although we engage in product improvement programs and processes our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 

  

6 revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment at which time title transfers to the customer revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue all freightrelated expenses are charged to cost of sales 

  

we do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities however as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders one time special pricing to support new product introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks for regular order volumes the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue in our domestic sales activities we use a number of manufacturer representatives to sell our products these representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force we do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such shipments our products are predominantly therapybased equipment and require no installation as such we have no significant installation obligations

foreign currency market risk 

  

our functional currency is the us dollar although the financial statements of our nonus subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies and as such we transact business in various foreign currencies including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 

  

we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and manufacturing expenditure the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in euro’s and the australian dollar under this program increases or decreases in our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments we have determined our hedge program to be a noneffective hedge as defined under sfas 133 the foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities all movements in the fair value of the foreign curency derivatives are recorded within other income net on our consolidated statements of income 

  

the table below provides information in us dollars on our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets by legal entity functional currency as of june 30 2004 in thousands 

  



  

 33  

the table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and presents the information in us dollar equivalents the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates including foreign currency call options held at june 30 2004 the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments these notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the options contracts 

  



  

interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments 

  

at june 30 2004 we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less we maintain a shortterm investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months these financial instruments principally comprised of corporate obligations are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 

  

a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during the twelve months ended june 30 2004 would have resulted in approximately 02 million change in pretax income in addition the value of our marketable securities would change by approximately 03 million following a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

this report on form 10k contains or may contain certain forwardlooking statements and information that are based on our management’s beliefs as well as on estimates and assumptions made by and information currently available to our management the words “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “plan” “future” and other similar expressions generally identify forwardlooking statements including in particular statements regarding the development and approval of new products and product applications market expansion pending litigation and the development of new markets for our products such as the cardiovascular and stroke markets these forwardlooking statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of the us private securities litigation reform act of 1995 you should not unduly rely on these forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect the views of our management at the time the statements are made and are subject to a number of risks uncertainties estimates and assumptions including without limitation and in addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements those identified below and elsewhere in this report in addition important factors to consider in evaluating such forwardlooking statements include changes or developments in social economic market legal or regulatory circumstances changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due 

  

 34  

to changes in our industry or the economy generally the emergence of new or growing competitors the actions or omissions of third parties including suppliers customers competitors and governmental authorities and various other factors should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or the underlying estimates or assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary significantly from those expressed in such forwardlooking statements and there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements contained in this report will in fact occur 

  

risk factors 

  

the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition or results of operations include the following 

  

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business the markets for our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to develop innovative new products and to be the first to market with those products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete 

  

additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business 

  

our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home health care products and sleep clinics we market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders we believe that home health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties 

  

we have limited resources to market to the more than 2500 us sleep clinics and the more than 4000 home health care dealer branch locations most of which use sell or recommend several brands of products in addition home health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and thirdparty reimbursement have declined for home care products and home health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written 

  

we have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleep disordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness of our products 

  

 35  

any inability to effectively market our products outside the us could impact our profitability approximately half our revenues are generated outside the us in approximately 60 different countries many of these countries have unique regulatory medical and business environments if we are unable to effectively market our products outside the us our overall financial performance could decline 

  

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth our business could suffer 

  

if we fail to integrate our acquisitions with our operations our business could suffer the integration of our acquired operations requires significant efforts from our company and the acquired entity for several years after each acquisition although we acquired our map subsidiary in february 2001 our labhardt subsidiary in november 2001 and our servo magnetics subsidiary in may 2002 we continue to adjust our business strategies equipment and personnel to achieve maximum efficiencies and success if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of our acquired entities we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 

  

we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the us and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets subjecting us to various risks relating to international activities that could adversely affect our overall profitability sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 51 52 and 51 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our us operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in australian dollars 

  

 36  

government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services therefore even if a product is approved for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such as spain france and germany government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia and the united kingdom there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights may harm our business 

  

as we continue to develop new products those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing in the united states we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and medicare 

  

in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program including private third party payers these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines 

  

in addition to reimbursement for our products our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products during fiscal year 2004 the us government proposed reductions in reimbursement rates for some of these other products such proposed reductions if they occur may have a material impact on our customers any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers 

  

complying with food and drug administration and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties we are subject to various federal state local and international regulations regarding our business activities failure to comply with these regulations could result in among other things recalls of our products substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees a recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs damage our reputation and materially affect operating results

product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales and profits to decline before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the 510k clearance process we have modified some of our 510k approved products without submitting new 510k notices which we do not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the 510k notification 

  

any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product prior to submitting a 510k notice additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer 

  

we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies 

  

offlabel marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional label indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for offlabel use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties 

  

disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including some who are singlesource suppliers for us we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part would limit our ability to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply 

  

our intellectual property may not protect our products and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims additionally there may be third party patents 

  

 38  

patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products 

  

we face the risks that 

  

   

   

   

   

   

litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products additionally the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits 

  

we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay substantial amounts which could harm our business 

  

we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions from time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and were subject to tax audits in france the us and germany during the year ended june 30 2004 the tax audits in france and the us were concluded in the year ended june 30 2004 with no material adjustments the german tax audit remains ongoing any assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income tax payable or deferred tax assets and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may result from a number of factors including 

  

   

   

 39  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial leadtime to repair or replace the facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 

  

delaware law provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could make it difficult for another company to acquire us provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders in particular our board of directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors 

  

additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders under our stockholder rights plan we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our series a junior participating preferred stock at a discount under certain circumstances the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 

  

you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our assets or officers and directors a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states additionally two of our seven directors and two of our five executive officers reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their assets in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts

the  market

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid
eye  movement  or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem
sleep  which  is  about  2025  of  total  sleep  experienced  by  adults  is
characterized  by  a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement
increased  heart  and  respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem
sleep  is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage
1  is  the  lightest  and  stage  4  is  the  deepest

the  upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of
upper  airway  muscles  normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem
sleep  upper  airway  muscles  relax  and  the airway narrows individuals with
narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the
upper  airway during sleep or apneas or near closures of the upper airways or
hypopneas  these  breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen
concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen
or  increased  carbon  dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the
individual  subconsciously  arouses  from  sleep  causing the throat muscles to
contract  opening  the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels
increase  and  the  individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats
itself  sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour
while  these  awakenings  greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is
not  normally  aware  of  these disruptions  in addition osa has recently been
recognized  as  a cause of hypertension and a significant comorbidity for heart
disease  stroke  and  diabetes  for  example one recent research study showed
that  83  of  an  adult patient population with drugresistant hypertension had
osa

in its wake up america report to congress in 1993 the national commission on
sleep  disorders research estimated that approximately 40 million individuals in
the  united  states suffer from chronic disorders of sleep and wakefulness such
as  sleep  apnea insomnia and narcolepsy according to this report sleep apnea
is  the  most  common  sleep  disorder  affecting  approximately  20  million
individuals  in the united states  despite the high prevalence of osa there is
a  general  lack  of  awareness  of osa among both the medical community and the
general  public  it  is  estimated  that 10 of those afflicted by osa know the
cause of their excessive daytime sleepiness or other symptoms  many health care
professionals  are  often  unable  to diagnose osa because they are unaware that
such  nonspecific  symptoms  as  excessive  daytime  sleepiness  snoring
hypertension  and  irritability  are  characteristic  of  osa

while  osa  has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is
predominant  among  middleaged  men  and  those  who  are obese smoke consume
alcohol  in  excess or use musclerelaxing and painkilling drugs  in addition
patients  who  are  being  treated for certain other conditions including those
undergoing  dialysis treatment or suffering from diabetes may have an increased
incidence  of osa  recent studies have also shown that sdb is present in 45 of
hypertension  patients  including  80  of  patients  with  drugresistant
hypertension  60 of stroke patients and 50 of patients with congestive heart
failure


sleepdisordered  breathing  and  obstructive  sleep  apnea

sleep disordered breathing or sdb encompasses all physiological processes that
cause  detrimental  breathing  patterns  during  sleep  manifestations  include
obstructive sleep apnea or osa central sleep apnea or csa and hypoventilation
syndromes  that  occur  during  sleep  hypoventilation  syndromes are generally
associated  with  obesity  chronic  obstructive  lung disease and neuromuscular
disease  osa  is  the  most  common  form  of  sdb

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can
lead  to  excessive  daytime  sleepiness  reduced cognitive function including
memory  loss  and  lack  of  concentration  depression  and  irritability  osa
sufferers  also  may  experience  an  increase in heart rate and an elevation of
blood  pressure  during  the cycle of apneas  several studies indicate that the
oxygen  desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by
osa  may  be  associated  with  increased  risk  of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality  due  to  angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been
shown  to  have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions
including  problem  solving  response  speed and visual motor coordination and
studies  have  linked  osa  to  increased  occurrences  of traffic and workplace
accidents

generally  an  individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred
by  a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis
of  osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep
clinic  or the patients home  during overnight testing respiratory parameters
and sleep patterns are monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate
and  blood oxygen levels these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep
disturbances  such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings  we estimate
that  there  are currently more than 2500 sleep clinics in the united states a
substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals  the number of sleep
clinics  has  expanded  significantly  from approximately 100 such facilities in
1985

existing  therapies

prior  to  1981  the  primary  treatment  for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical
procedure  to  cut  a  hole  in  the  patients windpipe to create a channel for
airflow  most  recently  surgery has involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
uppp  in  which  surgery  is performed on the upper airway to remove excess
tissue  and to streamline the shape of the airway or mandibular advancement in
which  the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patients airway  uppp alone
has a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with multistage
upper  airway  surgical  procedures  a  greater  success rate has been claimed
these  combined  procedures  performed  by  highly  specialized  surgeons  are
expensive  and  involve  prolonged  and  often  painful  recovery  periods

cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa  cpap was first used
as  a  treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the past chairman of our
medical advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for treatment of osa in
the  united  states  in  the  mid  1980s  today  use of nasal positive airway
pressure  is  generally  acknowledged  as  the most effective and least invasive
therapy  for  managing  osa

during  cpap  treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal mask connected to a small
portable  airflow  generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure  the
patient  breathes  in  air  from  the flow generator and breathes out through an
exhaust  port  in the mask  continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts
as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed  sometimes
when  a  patient  leaks air through their mouth a fullface mask may need to be
used

cpap  is  not  a  cure  and  therefore must be used on a daily basis as long as
treatment  is  required  patient  compliance  has  been  a  major factor in the
efficacy  of  cpap  treatment  early generations of cpap units provided limited
patient  comfort  and  convenience  patients  experienced  soreness  from  the
repeated  use  of  nasal  masks  and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap
device  operating  at  the  prescribed  pressure  in more recent years product
innovations  to  improve  patient  comfort  and  compliance have been developed
these  include more comfortable mask systems delay timers which gradually raise
air  pressure  allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel air flow
generators  including  vpap  systems which provide different air pressures for
inhalation  and  exhalation  heated  humidification systems to make the airflow
more  comfortable  and auto titration devices which reduce the average pressure
delivered  during  the  night

business  strategy

we  believe  that  the  sdb  market will continue to grow in the future due to a
number  of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding
of the role of sdb treatment in the management of cardiac neurologic metabolic
and related disorders and an increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for
expanding  our  business  operations  and  capitalizing on the growth of the sdb
market  consists  of  the  following  key  elements

continue  product  development  and  innovation  we  are  committed  to ongoing
innovation  in  developing  products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb  we
have  been  a  leading  innovator of products designed to more effectively treat
sdb  increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy
for  example  in  1999  we  introduced  the  mirage  full face mask  this mask
contains  an  inflatable  air  pocket  which  conforms  to the patients facial
contours creating a more comfortable and better seal  additionally in 2002 we
introduced  the  autoset  spirit  flow  generator  our  secondgeneration
autotitrating  device  that  adapts  to the patients breathing patterns to more
effectively  treat  osa  we  believe  that  continued  product  development and
innovation  are  key  factors  to  our ongoing success approximately 17 of our
employees  are  devoted  to research and development activities  in fiscal year
2003  we  invested  205  million  or  75  of our revenues in research and
development

expand  geographic  presence  we  market  our  products in over 60 countries to
sleep  clinics  home  health care dealers and third party payers  we intend to
increase  our  sales  and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as
expand  the  depth  of  our  presence  in  other  geographic  regions

increase  public  and  clinical  awareness  we intend to continue to expand our
existing  promotional  activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment
alternatives  these  promotional  activities  target  the  population  with
predisposition  to  sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such
as  cardiologists  neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target
special interest groups including the national stroke association the american
heart  association  and  the  national  sleep  foundation

during  fiscal  2002  we  donated  a  total of 23 million to the resmed sleep
disordered  breathing  foundations in the united states and australia to further
enhance research and awareness of sdb  the foundations contributions represent
resmeds  commitment  to  medical  research  into  sleepdisordered  breathing
particularly  the  treatment  of  obstructive  sleep  apnea

expand  into  new  clinical  applications  we  continually seek to identify new
applications  of  our  technology  for  significant unmet medical needs  recent
studies  have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and
congestive  heart failure and have recognized sdb as a cause of hypertension or
high  blood  pressure  we  have developed a device which has not been approved
for  sale  in the united states for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in
patients  with  congestive  heart  failure  currently 1000 patients are being
treated  by  this  device  in europe with significant improvements in quality of
life  and  heart function  in addition we maintain close working relationships
with  a  number  of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for
our  products  and  technology

leverage  the experience of our management team and medical advisory board  our
senior  management  team has extensive experience in the medical device industry
in  general  and in the field of sdb in particular  our medical advisory board
is  comprised  of experts in the field of sdb we intend to continue to leverage
the  experience  and  expertise  of these individuals to maintain our innovative
approach  to  the  development of products and increase awareness of the serious
medical  problems  caused  by  sdb

accessories  and  other  products

to  enhance  patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of
other products and accessories  these products include humidifiers such as the
humidaire  and  h2i which connect directly with the cpap vpap and autoset flow
generators  to  humidify  and  heat the air delivered to the patient  their use
prevents  the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort other optional
accessories  include  cold  passover  humidifiers  carry  bags  and  breathing
circuits  map also offers a range of accessories including the twister remote
an  intelligent  remote  control for use in the sleep lab environment to set and
monitor flow generators the aeroclick connection system which allows a quick
simple  connectdisconnect between the mask and cpap air delivery source and the
aerofix  headgear  for  the  comfortable  adjustment of masks for cpap therapy
since  the  may  2002  acquisition  of servo magnetics inc we have sold custom
electric  motors  primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications


product  development  and  clinical  trials

we  have  a  strong track record in innovation in the sleep market  in 1989 we
introduced  our  first  cpap  device  since  then  we have been committed to an
ongoing  program of product advancement and development  currently our product
development  efforts  are  focused  on  not  only  improving our current product
offerings  but  also  expanding into new product applications  for example in
1997  we  introduced  the  mirage  mask  this mask was based on the innovative
bubble  mask  technology  introduced  in  1991  which used the principle of air
inflation  of  the  mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by
better  conforming  to  patient  facial  contours

in  1999  we  introduced  the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device
that  adapts  to the patients breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas
in  2001  we  introduced  our next generation autotitrating device the autoset
spirit  the  autoset  spirit  is  an autotitrating modular device with optional
integrated  humidifier  currently  we  are bringing to market the activa nasal
mask  using  our  patented  active cushion technology which automatically seals
mask leaks  we are also about to launch our improved autoset cs ii outside the
us  only  to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central
sleep  apnea

we  continually  seek  to  identify  new  applications  of  our  technology  for
significant  unmet  medical  needs  sdb is associated with a number of symptoms
beyond  excessive  daytime  sleepiness  and  irritability  recent  studies have
established  a  clinical  association  between sdb and hypertension stroke and
congestive  heart  failure  we  support  clinical  trials in the united states
germany  france  the  united  kingdom  and  australia  to develop new clinical
applications  for  our  technology

we  consult  with  physicians  at  major  sleep  centers throughout the world to
identify  technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these physicians
currently  serve  on  our  medical  advisory  board  new product ideas are also
identified  by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors
manufacturers representatives customers and patients typically our internal
development  staff  then  perform  new  product  development

in  fiscal  years  2003 2002 and 2001 we invested 205 million 149 million
and  111  million  respectively  on  research  and  development

we  also promote and market our products directly to sleep clinics patients who
are  diagnosed  with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are typically referred by
the  diagnosing  sleep  clinic  to  a  home  health  care  dealer  to  fill  the
prescription  the  home  health care dealer in consultation with the referring
physician  will  assist the patient in selecting the equipment fit the patient
with  the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed
level  in  the  united  states  our  sales  employees  and  manufacturers
representatives  are managed by two regional sales directors our vice president
of  sales  and  our  chief  operating  officer  for  the  americas

the  national stroke association to increase awareness about the high prevalence
of  sdb  in  the  stroke  survivor  population

ii  american  heart  association  we  are  working  closely  with the western
affiliates  of  the  american heart association on a number of local programs to
increase  awareness and education about sdb we are also in discussions with the
national american heartamerican stroke associations regarding national programs
initially  targeting  clinicians  on the impact of sdb on both heart disease and
stroke patients as well as its role in the development of hypertension a major
risk  factor  for  both  heart  disease  and  stroke

iii  national sleep foundation  the national sleep foundation is a nonprofit
organization  dedicated  to  improving  public  health and safety by raising the
level  of awareness and education toward sleep related programs and research we

manufacturing

our  principal  manufacturing  facilities  are  located in sydney australia and
comprise  a  120000  square  feet  manufacturing  and  research and development
facility  we  also  rent some space in nearby buildings  we are in the process
of  building  a new 215000 square feet manufacturing facility in sydney due to
be  completed  in the first half of calendar 2004  our manufacturing operations
consist  primarily  of  assembly  and  testing of our flow generators masks and
accessories  of  the numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for
assembly  of  our  therapeutic  and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are
offtheshelf  items  available from multiple vendors  we generally manufacture
to  our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received  over the last two
years  the  manufacturing  processes  have  been  transformed  along world class
manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams  each team is
responsible for manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are
based  on  performance  and  quality  measures  including  customer  feedback

facility  is  approximately  35500  square  feet


thirdparty  reimbursement

the  cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded
in  substantial  part by government and private insurance programs  although we
do  not  generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers
our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain
adequate  reimbursement  for  our  products

in  the  united states our products are purchased primarily by home health care
dealers  hospitals  or  sleep  clinics  which  then invoice thirdparty payers
directly  domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate
health  insurance  plans  these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine
that  a  device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods
or  is  experimental unnecessary or inappropriate  the longterm trend towards
managed  health  care  or  legislative  proposals  to reform health care could
control  or  significantly  influence  the  purchase of health care services and
products  and  could  result  in  lower  prices  for  our  products

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers
and  to  sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and
other  thirdparty  payers  directly  for  reimbursement  for  our  products
nevertheless  we  are  still  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  relating  to
governmental  programs  and  any  violation of these laws and regulations could
result  in  civil  and  criminal  penalties  including  fines

in  particular  the  federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly
and  willfully  soliciting  receiving  offering  or  providing  remuneration
directly  or  indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the
furnishing  recommending  or arranging for a good or service for which payment
may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid
programs  the  government  has  interpreted  this  law  broadly to apply to the
marketing  and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us  many
states  have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law  we are also
subject  to  other  federal  and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any
thirdparty  payer  these  laws  prohibit  persons from knowingly and willfully
filing  false  claims  or  executing  a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit
program  including  private  thirdparty  payers  these  laws  may  apply  to
manufacturers  and  distributors who provide information on coverage coding and
reimbursement  of  their  products  to  persons who bill thirdparty payers  we
continuously  strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements
do  not  violate  these  laws  liability may still arise from the intentions or
actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental
agency  interpretation  of  the  laws

page

in  some  foreign  markets  such  as  spain  france  and  germany  government
reimbursement  is  currently  available  for purchase or rental of our products
however  subject  to  constraints  such  as  price  controls  or  unit  sales
limitations  in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently
limited  or  no  reimbursement  for  devices  that  treat  osa


service  and  warranty

we  generally  offer  onetotwo  year  limited warranties on our flow generator
products  warranties on mask systems are for 90 days  in most markets we rely
on  our  distributors  to repair our products with parts supplied by us  in the
united  states  home health care dealers generally arrange shipment of products
to  our  san  diego  facility  for  repair

we  receive  returns  of  our  products  from the field for various reasons  we
believe  that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels
typically  experienced  by  manufacturers  of  similar  devices  we provide for
warranties  and  returns  based  on  historical  data


competition

the  markets  for  our  products  are  highly  competitive  we believe that the
principal  competitive  factors  in  all  of  our  markets are product features
reliability  and price  customer support reputation and efficient distribution
are  also  important  factors

we  compete  on  a  marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which
have  greater  financial  research  manufacturing and marketing resources than
ourselves  in  the  united  states  our  principal  market respironics inc
devilbiss  a  division  of sunrise medical inc and nellcor puritan bennett a
subsidiary of tyco inc are the primary competitors for our cpap products  our
principal  european  competitors  are  also  respironics devilbiss and nellcor
puritan  bennett  as  well  as  regional european manufacturers  the disparity
between  our  resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of
the  recent  trend  towards  consolidation  in  the  health  care  industry  in
addition  our  products  compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances
designed  to  treat  osa  and  other  sdb  related  respiratory conditions  the
development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in
our  products  becoming  obsolete  or  noncompetitive  resulting  in a material
adverse  effect  on our business financial condition and results of operations

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete
for market acceptance and market share  an important factor in such competition
may  be the timing of market introduction of competitive products  accordingly
the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing
and  regulatory  clearance  processes  and  supply  commercial quantities of the
product  to  the  market  are  expected to be important competitive factors  in
addition  our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to
which  we  are  successful  in  protecting  our  patents  and other intellectual
property

patents  and  proprietary  rights  and  related  litigation

through  our  subsidiaries  resmed  limited medizintechnik fur arzt und patient
gmbh and smi we own or have licensed rights to 108 issued united states patents
including  24  design  patents  and  135 issued foreign patents  in addition
there  are  139  pending  united states patent applications including 23 design
patent applications and 249 pending foreign patent applications  some of these
patents  and  patent  applications relate to significant aspects and features of
our  products  these include us patents relating to our cpap devices a delay
timer  system  the  bubble mask and an automated means of varying air pressure
based  upon a patients changing needs during nightly use such as that employed
in  our  autoset  device

of  our patents four united states patents and three foreign patents are due to
expire  in the next five years with one foreign patent due to expire in each of
the  years  2004  2005  and  2007 and two united states patents in 2007 and one
united  states  patent  in each of the years 2005 and 2008  we believe that the
expiration  of  these  patents  will  not  have a material adverse impact on our
competitive  position

we  rely  on  a  combination  of  patents  trade  secrets  trade  marks  and
nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights  our
subsidiary  resmed  limited  is  pursuing  infringement  actions  against  a
competitor  and  is investigating possible infringement by others  see item 3 
legal  proceedings

additional  litigation  may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents issued to
us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us
of  the  proprietary rights of others  patent laws regarding the enforceability
of  patents  vary from country to country  therefore there can be no assurance

government  regulations

our  products  are  subject  to  extensive regulation particularly as to safety
efficacy  and  adherence  to  fda quality system regulation or qsr and related
manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and
other  governmental  agency  regulations in the united states and regulations of
relevant  foreign  agencies  abroad  the  fda  regulates  the  introduction
manufacture  advertising  labeling  packaging  marketing  distribution and
record  keeping  for  such  products  in  order to ensure that medical products
distributed  in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use
in  addition  the  fda  is  authorized to establish special controls to provide
reasonable  assurance  of  the  safety  and  effectiveness of most devices  non
compliance  with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines
civil  penalties  injunctions  suspensions  or losses of regulatory approvals
recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government
to  approve  product  export  applications  or  allow  us  to  enter into supply
contracts  and  criminal  prosecution

the  fda  requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new
indication  for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k
premarket  notification  clearance  or a premarket approval or pma prior to it
being  introduced  into  the us market our products currently marketed in the
united  states  are  marketed  in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as
either  class  i  or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k
clearance  generally  requires  the  submission  of  performance  data and often
clinical  data  which  in  some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the
device  is  substantially equivalent to a device that was on the market prior
to  1976  or  to  a  device  that has been found by the fda to be substantially
equivalent  to such a pre1976 device  as a result fda approval requirements
may  extend  the  development  process  for  a  considerable length of time  in
addition  in  some  cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory
panel  which  can  further  lengthen  the  process  the  pma process which is
reserved  for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate
device  and  for  high risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain
human  life  may  take  several  years and requires the submission of extensive
performance  and  clinical  information

smi  acquisition  on may 14 2002 we acquired all of the common stock of servo
magnetics  incorporated  smi  through  a  merger  with  our  whollyowned
subsidiary servo magnetics acquisitions inc for total consideration including
acquisition  costs  of  326  million  consideration  included  the  issue of
853448  shares  for  fair  value  of  248  million  with  the  balance of the
acquisition  price paid in cash  upon consummation of the merger the surviving
corporation  servo  magnetics  acquisition  inc  changed  its  name  to servo
magnetics  inc

the  acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  as  a purchase and accordingly the
results  of  operations  of smi have been included in our consolidated financial
statements  from  may  14  2002  an  amount of 307 million representing the
excess  of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired  of  19  million  has  been  recorded  as  goodwill

purchased  inprocess research and development of 04 million was expensed upon
acquisition  of  smi  because  technological  feasibility  of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed
the  value  of  inprocess  technology  was  calculated  by identifying research
projects  in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established
estimating  the  costs  to  develop  the  purchased  in  process technology into
commercially  viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products  discounting  the  net  cash  flows to present value and applying the
reduced  percentage  completion of the projects thereto  the discount rate used
in  the  analysis  was  19  and  was  based on the risk profile of the acquired
assets

purchased  research and development projects related to electrical motor systems
used in our flow generator devices and other medical and data storage equipment
key  assumptions  used in the analysis included gross margins of 34  as of the
date  of  acquisition  new  motor  systems  for  use  in  medical  and  health
applications  were  expected to be completed and commercially available by 2004
these  projects  have  estimated  costs to complete totalling approximately 05
million

we  believe  that  the  assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets
were reasonable at the time of acquisition  no assurance can be given however
that  the  underlying  assumptions  used  to estimate expected project revenues

3  fiscal  year  ended  june  30  2001

map  medizintechnologie  gmbh  map  on  february  16  2001 our whollyowned
german  subsidiary  resmed  beteiligungs gmbh acquired all the common stock of
map  medizintechnologie  gmbh  map  for  total  consideration  including
acquisition  costs  of  554  million  map  is  a  leading  german  designer
manufacturer  and distributor of medical devices for the diagnosis and treatment
of  sdb  with  a  particular  focus  on  osa

the  acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  as  a purchase and accordingly the
results  of  operations  of map have been included in our consolidated financial
statements from february 16 2001  an amount of 471 million representing the
excess  of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired  has  been  recorded  as  goodwill

purchased inprocess research and development of 177 million was expensed upon
acquisition  of  map  because  technological  feasibility  of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed
the  value  of  inprocess  technology  was  calculated  by identifying research
projects  in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established
estimating  the  costs  to  develop  the  purchased  inprocess  technology into
commercially  viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products  discounting  the  net  cash  flows to present value and applying the
reduced  percentage completion of the projects thereto  the discount rates used
in  the  analysis were between 27 and 33 and were based on the risk profile of
the  acquired  assets

all purchased research and development projects related to medical equipment for
the  treatment  of  sleep disordered breathing primarily for the development of
mask  interface  systems  and  autotitrating  devices  for  the  treatment  of
obstructive  sleep  apnea and associated disorders  key assumptions used in the
analysis  included  gross  margins  ranging  from 70 to 80  as of the date of
acquisition  the  mask  interface  systems  were  expected  to be completed and
commercially available in 2002 and versions of the autotitrating devices between
2003  and  2005  these  projects  had  estimated  costs  to  complete totalling
approximately  20  million

we  believe  that  the  assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets
were reasonable at the time of acquisition  no assurance can be given however
that  the  underlying  assumptions  used  to estimate expected project revenues
development  costs  or  profitability  or events associated with such projects
will  transpire  as  estimated  for these reasons among others actual results
may  vary  from  the  projected  results

during  the  december  2001  we  paid  an  amount  of  14  million  as  final
consideration associated with the purchase of map  the amount has been recorded
as  goodwill

inprocess  research  and development charge  on acquisition of map in february
2001 we recognized as an expense a charge of 177 million with respect to five
inprocess  research and development programs under active development by map at
date  of  acquisition  the  five  projects  were

i     a  singlewalled  nasal  cushion  mask  system
ii    new  headgear  system
iii   standalone  active  humidifier
iv    an  autotitration  cpap  device  for  treatment  of  osa
v     a  new  osa  diagnostic  device

the  status  of  each  project  as  at  june  30  2003  is  as  noted  below

i     singlewalled nasal cushion  the nasal cushion under development by map
on  acquisition  was  due for release in october 2001  delays in the design and
manufacturing  process  delayed  the release for seven months until april 2002
the  delay  in release of the product was not significant over its expected life
cycle  and has made no significant impact on the net return assumptions used in
the  initial  inprocess  research  and  development  model  since release the
product  now  referred to as the papillon has met or exceeded sales forecasts

ii     new  headgear   the new headgear product line was withheld to coincide
with the release of the papillon mask system in april 2002 and so was also seven
months  behind  schedule  in  projected  release  dates  since release the new
headgear system has exceeded original sales projections and continues to meet or
exceed  initial  expectations

iii     standalone  active  humidifier    due  to other priorities and to the
introduction  of integrated humidification flow generator devices by a number of
competitors  during  fiscal  2002  we  have  delayed  the standalone humidifier
project

     given  the  relatively  small  revenue  forecast of the product line in the
iprd  model  the  financial  impact  of  this  project  is not material to our
business  or  the  net  return  of  the  map  acquisition

iv     autotitration  cpap device  the main product development effort of map
since  acquisition  has  been  the  completion  of  the  autotitration cpap flow
generator  specified  in the initial inprocess research and development charge
this  project  experienced  some  delays  due  to the complexity of the software
algorithm  development  process  and  associated  electronics  map released the
product  in  november 2002 since release sales of the product now referred to
as  magellan  have  been  within  expectations

v     osa  diagnostic  device   maps new diagnostic device remains on target
for  initial  market  release  in calendar 2003 although the forecasted release
date of march 2003 was not achieved  we remain confident in the capacity of the
diagnostic algorithm to significantly enhance the diagnostic process and remain
confident  in the potential of the product to significantly impact the treatment
and  diagnosis  of  obstructive  sleep  apnea  in  the  german  market

as  at  june  30  2003 three of the five programs have been completed with the
release  of  the  papillon  mask  system  upgraded  headgear  and  the magellan
automated  flow  generator  device  all  three  products  are  generating sales
revenue  consistent  with  our  original  expectations  and  assumptions used in
calculating  the  inprocess  research  and  development  charge  we  expect to
release  products  with  respect  to  both  remaining  inprocess  research  and
development  programs  over  the  next  twelvemonth  period which is generally
consistent  with  our  original  expectations

given  the  successful completion of the above research programs and performance
of  the associated product lines we remain confident in the assumptions used to
determine  the  inprocess research and development charge and as a result the
net  return  of  the  map  acquisition

tax  expense  our  income  tax  rate  is governed by the laws of the regions in
which  our  income  is recognized  to date a substantial portion of our income
has  been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in
fiscal  2003 and 2002 and was 34 in fiscal 2001  during fiscal 2003 2002 and
2001  our  effective  tax  rate  has  fluctuated  between approximately 31 and
approximately  57  these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective
tax  rates  will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research
and  development  expenditures  for  which  a  125  australian tax deduction is
available  the  level  of nondeductible expenses and the use of available net
operating  loss  carryforward  deductions  and  other  tax  credits  or benefits
available  to  us  under  applicable  tax  laws

we  account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  deferred tax
assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  for  the  future  tax  consequences
attributable  to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing  assets  and  liabilities and their respective tax bases  deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change  in  tax  rates  is  recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment  date

fiscal  year  ended  june  30  2003  compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2002

net  revenues  net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 2736
million  from  2041  million  for the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of
695  million  or  34

the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our
flow  generators  and accessories  sales also benefited from an appreciation of
international  currencies  against  the  us  dollar  increasing  sales  by
approximately  168  million and inclusion of sales of 65 million from servo
magnetics  inc  smi  the subsidiary we acquired in may 2002  net revenue in
north  and latin america increased to 1307 million from 1009 million for the
years ended june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively  this growth primarily reflects
increased  public  and  physician  awareness of sleepdisordered breathing  net
revenue in international markets increased to 1428 million from 1031 million
for  the  years  ended june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively  international sales
growth  for  the year ended june 30 2003 reflects organic growth in the overall
sleep  disordered  breathing  market  appreciation  of international currencies
against  the  us  dollar and sarsrelated sales to china of approximately 50
million

sales  of  flow  generators  for  the  year ended june 30 2003 increased by 29
compared to the year ended june 30 2002 including increases of 23 in north and
latin  america  and  33  elsewhere  sales  of  mask  systems motors and other
accessories  increased  by  40  including  increases  of 35 in north and latin
america and 47 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2003 compared to the year
ended  june  30  2002  these increases primarily reflect growth in the overall
sleepdisordered  breathing  market  appreciation  of  international currencies
against  the  us  dollar  and  our  acquisition  of  smi

gross profit  gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2003 to 1731
million  from  1332  million  for the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of
399 million or 30  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for
the  year  ended june 30 2003 to 63 from 65 for the year ended june 30 2002
reflecting  the  impact  of higher manufacturing costs resulting from a stronger
australian  dollar against the us dollar as the majority of manufacturing labor
and  overhead  costs  are  incurred  in  australia  and to a lesser extent the
inclusion  of  smis  motor  sales  which  achieve lower margins compared to our
overall  gross  margin

selling  general  and  administrative  expenses  selling  general  and
administrative  expenses  increased  for  the  year ended june 30 2003 to 853
million  from  645  million  for  the year ended june 30 2002 an increase of
208  million  or  32  as  a  percentage of net revenue selling general and
administrative  expenses  for  the  year  ended  june  30 2003 decreased to 31
compared  to  32  for  the  year ended june 30 2002  the increase in selling
general  and  administrative  expenses  was  primarily due to an increase in the
number  of  sales and administrative personnel and other expenses related to the
increase  in  our  sales  the  increase  in selling general and administrative
expenses  was  also  attributable  to  appreciation  of international currencies
against the us dollar adding approximately 60 million the inclusion of 26
million  from  smis operations and 22 million in litigation costs associated
with  outstanding  patent  infringement  lawsuits  against  competitors

research  and development expenses  research and development expenses increased
for  the  year  ended  june 30 2003 to 205 million from 149 million for the
year  ended  june 30 2002 an increase of 56 million or 38  as a percentage
of  net  revenue research and development expenses were 75 for the year ended
june  30  2003 compared to 73 for the year ended june 30 2002  the increase
in  research  and  development expenses was due to increased salaries associated
with  an  increase  in  personnel  and  increased  charges  for consulting fees
clinical  trials and technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of
new  products  the  increase  also  reflects  an appreciation of the australian
dollar  against the us dollar as the majority of research and development costs
are  incurred  in  australian dollars  in constant currency terms research and
development expenses for the year ended june 30 2003 increased by 31 million
or  17  compared  to  the  year  ended  june  30  2002

other income expense net  other income expense net decreased for the year
ended  june  30  2003  to  net  expense of 01 million from net income of 34
million  for  the  year  ended  june 30 2002  the decrease in other income was
attributable  to  lower  gains  on  extinguishment  of  debt partially offset by
increased net foreign currency exchange gains and lower interest expense due to
the  reduction  in  convertible  note  debt

income  taxes  our  effective  income  tax rate increased to 319 for the year
ended june 30 2003 from 313 for the year ended june 30 2002  the marginally
higher tax rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of taxable income  we
continue  to  benefit  from the australian corporate tax rate of 30 because we
generate  a  majority  of  our  taxable  income  in  australia


fiscal  year  ended  june  30  2002  compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2001

net  revenues  net revenue increased for the year ended june 30 2002 to 2041
million  from  1552  million  for  the year ended june 302001 an increase of
489  million  or 32  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase
in  unit  sales  of  our  flow  generators  and accessories in both domestic and
international  markets  and  the inclusion of incremental sales of 172 million
from  map medizintechnologie gmbh map the subsidiary we acquired in february
2001

net  revenue  in  north and latin america increased to 1009 million from 799
million  for  the  years ended june 30 2002 and 2001 respectively  this growth
reflects increased public and physician awareness of sleepdisordered breathing
net  revenue  in  other  international  markets increased to 1031 million from
752  million  for  the  years  ended  june  30  2002  and  2001 respectively
international  sales  growth  for  the year ended june 30 2002 reflects organic
growth in the overall sleepdisordered breathing market and a full year of sales
from  our  subsidiary  map

sales  of  flow  generators  for  the  year ended june 30 2002 increased by 35
compared to the year ended june 30 2001 including increases of 22 in north and
latin  america  and  47  elsewhere  sales  of  mask  systems motors and other
accessories  increased  by  28  including  increases  of 30 in north and latin
america and 24 elsewhere for the year ended june 30 2002 compared to the year
ended  june  30  2002  these  increases  reflect  growth  in  the  overall
sleepdisordered  breathing  market  and  our  acquisition  of  map

gross profit  gross profit increased for the year ended june 30 2002 to 1332
million  from  1048  million  for the year ended june 30 2001 an increase of
285  million or 27  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue declined for
the  year  ended june 30 2002 to 65 from 68 for the year ended june 30 2001
the  decline in gross margins reflects a change in geographical sales mix other
than  map  sales  with  a relatively higher percentage of domestic sales which
achieve  lower  margins  compared  to  international markets  the decline also
reflects  that  gross  margins in our acquired subsidiary map are historically
lower  than  the  average  margins  achieved  by  our  company  as  a  whole

selling  general  and  administrative  expenses  selling  general  and
administrative  expenses  increased  for  the  year ended june 30 2002 to 645
million  from  494  million  for  the year ended june 30 2001 an increase of
151  million  or  31  as  a  percentage of net revenue selling general and
administrative  expenses  for  the  year ended june 30 2002 was 32 consistent
with  the  year  ended  june  30  2001  the  increase  in selling general and
administrative  expenses  was  primarily  due to the addition of 98 personnel in
sales  and  administration  and  other  expenses  related to the increase in our
sales  sga in fiscal 2002 also included a provision of 10 million against an
outstanding  receivable  from  american  home  patient inc ahp a significant
customer  who  filed  for  chapter  11  bankruptcy protection on july 31 2002
ahps  filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is not expected to materially
impact  our  business

provision  for  restructure  in the year ended june 30 2001 subsequent to the
purchase of map we restructured maps unprofitable french activities and took a
charge  of  06  million  associated  with their closure  we did not incur any
restructure  charges  for  the  year  ended  june  30  2002

inprocess research and development writeoff  in the year ended june 30 2002
purchased in process research and development of 04 million was expensed upon
the  acquisition  of smi because technological feasibility of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed
in  the  year ended june 30 2001 purchased inprocess research and development
of  177  million  was  expensed  upon  acquisition  of  map

donations  to  foundations  in  the year ended june 30 2002 we committed 23
million  to  the  establishment  of  two  resmed  sleep  disordered  breathing
foundations  one  in  the united states and one in australia  the foundations
overall  mission is to educate both the public and physicians about the inherent
dangers  of untreated sdbosa particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and
cardiovascular  disease

research  and development expenses  research and development expenses increased
in  fiscal  2002 to 149 million from 111 million for the year ended june 30
2001  an  increase  of  38  million  or 34  as a percentage of net revenue
research  and development expenses increased to 73 for the year ended june 30
2002  compared to 72 in fiscal 2001  the increase in research and development
expenses  was due to increased salaries associated with an increase in personnel
and  increased  charges  for  consulting  fees  clinical  trials  and technical
assessments  incurred  to  facilitate  development  of  new  products  and also
includes  research  and  development  expenditures  of  map

other  income  expense  other  income  expense net increased for the year
ended  june  30  2002  to a net income of 34 million from net income of 13
million  for  the  year  ended  june  30  2001  the  increase  in other income
primarily  reflects  a  gain on extinguishment of debt of 65 million partially
offset  by  increased net interest expense associated with our convertible notes
and  foreign  exchange  losses

income taxes  our effective income tax rate declined to approximately 313 for
the  year  ended june 30 2002 from approximately 574 for the year ended june
30  2001  the  lower  tax  rate is a corollary of the  high effective tax rate
in fiscal 2001 the high effective tax rate for the year ended june 30 2001 was
primarily  due to nondeductible  expenses of 177  million for  an  inprocess
research and development  writedown  and 06 million in restructuring charges
to a  lesser extent the lower effective tax rate also reflects the  lowering of
the  corporate  income  tax  rate  in  australia  from   34  to  30  effective
july 1 2001  we  also  benefit  from a  125  tax deduction  on  research  and
development  expenditures in australia which  further  reduces  the   effective
tax  rate  on  australian  sourced  income


liquidity  and  capital  resources

in  inventories  was  less  than the 34 incremental increase in revenues in the
year  ended  june  30  2003  compared  to  the  year  ended june 30 2002  the

the  results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange
rates  between  currencies  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our
consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations
we  are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash
flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
we  manage  this  risk  through  foreign  currency  option  contracts

we  expect to satisfy all of our short term and longterm liquidity requirements
through  a  combination  of  cash  on hand cash generated from operations and a
150  million  undrawn  revolving line of credit with union bank of california


critical  accounting  principles  and  estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates
and  judgments  that  affect  our  reported  amounts  of assets and liabilities
revenues  and  expenses  and  related  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities  on  an  ongoing  basis  we evaluate our estimates including those
related  to  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  inventory  reserves  warranty
obligations  goodwill  impaired  assets  intangible  assets income taxes and
contingencies

we  state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and
at  relevant  sections in this discussion and analysis  the estimates are based
on  the  information  that  is  currently  available  to us and on various other
assumptions  that  we  believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual
results  could  vary  from  those  estimates  under  different  assumptions  or
conditions

we  believe  that  the  following  critical  accounting policies affect the more
significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in the preparation of our financial
statements

1  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  we  maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts  for  estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to
make  required  payments  which  results in bad debt expense  we determine the
adequacy  of  this  allowance  by  continually  evaluating  individual  customer
receivables  considering  a  customers financial condition credit history and
current  economic  conditions  if the financial condition of our customers were
to  deteriorate  resulting  in an impairment of their ability to make payments
additional  allowances  may  be  required

2  inventory  adjustments   inventories are stated at lower of cost or market
and  are determined by the firstin firstout method  we review the components
of  inventory  on  a  regular  basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory
based  on  estimated  future  usage  and  sales  the likelihood of any material
inventory  writedowns  is  dependent  on changes in competitive conditions new
product  introductions  by  us  or our competitors or rapid changes in customer
demand

3  valuation  of  goodwill  intangible  and other longlived assets   we use
assumptions  in  establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives
of  our longlived assets and goodwill  the criteria used for these evaluations
include  managements  estimate  of  the  assets continuing ability to generate
positive  income  from  operations  and  positive  cash  flow  in future periods
compared  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  as  well  as  the strategic
significance  of  any  identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives
if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount
by  which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
useful  lives  and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our
estimate  of  the  period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be
used  by  us
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported
results  include significant changes in the assets ability to generate positive
cash  flow loss of legal ownership or title to the asset a significant decline
in  the  economic  and  competitive  environment  on  which  the  asset depends
significant  changes  in  our  strategic business objectives utilization of the
asset  and  a significant change in the economic andor political conditions in
certain  countries

31
page

4  valuation of deferred income taxes   valuation allowances are established
when  necessary  to  reduce  deferred  tax  assets to the amount expected to be
realized  the  likelihood  of  a material change in our expected realization of
these  assets  is  dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax
loss  carryforwards  against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax
planning  and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in
and  any  significant  changes  in  the  tax  treatment received on our business
combinations

5  provision  for  warranty   we  provide  for  the estimated cost of product
warranties  at  the  time the related revenue is recognized  the amount of this
provision  is  determined  by  using  a  financial  model  which  takes  into
consideration  actual  historical  expenses and potential risks associated with
our  different  products  this  financial  model  is then used to calculate the
future  probable  expenses  related  to  warranty  and the required level of the
warranty  provision  although  we  engage  in  product improvement programs and
processes  our  warranty  obligation  is  affected by product failure rates and
costs incurred to correct those product failures  should actual product failure
rates  or  estimated  costs  to  repair  those  product failures differ from our
estimates  revisions  to  our  estimated  warranty provision would be required

6  revenue  recognition  revenue  on product sales is recorded at the time of
shipment  at  which  time  title transfers to the customer  revenue on product
sales  which  require  customer  acceptance  is not recorded until acceptance is
received  royalty  revenue  from  license  agreements  is recorded when earned
service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred
and  recognized ratably over the life of the service contract  revenue received
in  advance  from  rental  unit  contracts  is initially deferred and recognized
ratably  over  the  life of the rental contract  revenue from sale of marketing
and  distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue
over the life of the contract  freight charges billed to customers are included
in  revenue  all  freightrelated  expenses  are  charged  to  cost  of  sales

we  do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of
our  products  or  similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or
activities  however  as  part  of  our  sales processes we may provide upfront
discounts  for  large  orders  one  time special pricing to support new product
introductions sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or pricebreaks
for  regular  order  volumes  the costs of all such programs are recorded as an
adjustment  to  revenue  in  our  domestic  sales activities we use a number of
manufacturer  representatives  to  sell our products  these representatives are
paid  a  direct  commission  on  sales  and  act as an integral component of our
domestic sales force  we do not sell our products to these representatives and
do  not  recognize  revenue  on  such shipments  our products are predominantly
therapy  based  equipment  and  require  no  installation  as  such we have no
significant  installation  obligations

instruments  with  characteristics  of  both  liabilities  and equity  sfas 150
requires  that certain financial instruments which under previous guidance were

financial  instruments  affected  include  mandatory  redeemable  stock certain
financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of
its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can
be  settled  with  shares  of  stock  sfas  150  is effective for all financial

risks

foreign  currency  market  risk

our  functional  currency  is  the us dollar although we transact business in
various  foreign  currencies including a number of major european currencies as
well  as  the  australian dollar  we have significant foreign currency exposure
through  both  our  australian  manufacturing activities and international sales
operations

we  have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency
options  to hedge foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and
manufacturing  expenditure  the goal of this hedging program is to economically
guarantee  or  lock  in  the  exchange  rates  on our foreign currency exposures
denominated  in euros and the australian dollar  under this program increases
or  decreases in our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities
and  firm  commitments  are  partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging
instruments

interest  rate  risk

we  are  exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the
return  on  our  investments

at  june  30  2003 we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in
financial  instruments  with  original  maturities  of three months or less  we
maintain  a  shortterm investment portfolio containing financial instruments in
which  the  majority  have  original maturities of greater than three months but
less  than twelve months  these financial instruments principally comprised of
corporate  obligations  are  subject  to interest rate risk and will decline in
value  if  interest  rates  increase

a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during the twelve months
ended june 30 2003 would have resulted in approximately 08 million change in
pretax income  in addition the value of our marketable securities would change
by approximately 07 million following a hypothetical 100 basis point change in
interest  rates  we  do  not  use  derivative  financial  instruments  in  our
investment  portfolio

risk  factors

the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition or
results  of  operations  include  the  following

our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business  the
markets  for  our sleepdisordered breathing products are highly competitive and
are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology  our
ability  to  compete  successfully  depends  in part on our ability to develop
innovative  new products and to be the first to market with those products  the
development  of  innovative  new products by our competitors or the discovery of
alternative  treatments  or potential cures for the conditions that our products
treat  could  result  in  our  products  becoming  noncompetitive  or  obsolete
additionally  some  of  our  competitors  have  greater financial research and
development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do  the past several
years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in
the  markets  for  our products  industry consolidation could result in greater
competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are
acquired  by other companies with greater resources than ours  this competition
could  increase  pressure  on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or
could  cause  us  to increase our spending on research and development and sales
and  marketing  if  we  are unable to develop innovative new products maintain
competitive  pricing  and  offer  products  that  consumers  perceive  to be as
reliable  as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease
which  would  harm  our  business

our  business  depends  on  our ability to market effectively to dealers of home
health  care  products  and  sleep clinics  we market our products primarily to
home  health  care  dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose obstructive sleep
apnea  and  other sleep disorders  we believe that home health care dealers and
sleep  clinics  play  a significant role in determining which brand of product a
patient  will use  the success of our business depends on our ability to market
effectively  to  home  health  care dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our
products  are  properly  marketed  and  sold  by  these  third  parties

we  have  limited  resources to market to the more than 2500 us sleep clinics
and  the more than 4000 home health care dealer branch locations most of which
use  sell  or  recommend  several brands of products  in addition home health
care  dealers  have  experienced  price  pressures as government and thirdparty
reimbursement have declined for home care products and home health care dealers
are  requiring  price  discounts  and longer periods of time to pay for products
purchased  from  us  we  cannot  assure  you  that sleep clinic physicians will
continue to prescribe our products or that home health care dealers or patients
will  not  substitute  competing  products  when  a  prescription specifying our
products  has  been  written

we  have  expanded  our  marketing  activities  to  target the population with a
predisposition to sleep disordered breathing as well as primary care physicians
and  various  medical  specialists  we  cannot  assure you that these marketing
efforts  will  be  successful  in  increasing  awareness  of  our  products

any  inability  to effectively market our products outside the us could impact
our  profitability  approximately  half  our revenues are generated outside the
us  in  approximately  60  different countries  many of these countries have
unique  regulatory  medical  and  business  environments  if we are unable to
market  our  products  effectively  outside  the  us  our  overall  financial
performance  could  decline

if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could suffer  we
have  experienced  rapid  and  substantial  growth  as we continue to grow the
complexity  of  our  operations  increases  placing  greater  demands  on  our
management  our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability
to  implement  and improve our financial and management information systems on a
timely  basis  and  to  effect  other  changes  in  our  business  unexpected
difficulties  during  expansion  the  failure  to  attract and retain qualified
employees  the  failure  to  successfully  replace  or  upgrade  our management
information  systems  the  failure  to manage costs or our inability to respond
effectively  to  growth  or  plan for future expansion could cause our growth to
stop  if  we  fail  to  manage  our  growth  our  business  could  suffer

if  we  fail  to  integrate  our  recent  acquisitions  with our operations our
business  could  suffer   the  integration  of our acquired operations requires
significant  efforts from our company and the acquired entity for several years
after  each  acquisition  although  we  acquired our map subsidiary in february
2001  our  labhardt  subsidiary  in  november  2001  and  our  servo magnetics
subsidiary  in  may  2002  we  continue  to  adjust  our  business  strategies
equipment and personnel to achieve maximum efficiencies and success  if we are
not  able  to successfully integrate the operations of our acquired entities we
may  not  fully  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  acquisitions

we  manufacture  substantially  all  of our products outside the us and sell a
significant  portion  of  our  products  in  nonus  markets subjecting us to
various  risks  relating to international activities that could adversely affect
our  overall profitability  sales outside north and latin america accounted for
approximately  52  51 and 48 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2003 2002
and  2001  respectively  we  expect that sales within these areas will account
for  approximately 50 of our net revenues in the foreseeable future  our sales
outside  of  north  america and our operations in europe australia and asia are
subject  to  several  difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from
those  we  face  in  our  domestic  operations  including

    fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates
    tariffs  and  other  trade  barriers
    compliance  with  foreign  medical  device  manufacturing  regulations
    reduction  in  third  party  payer  reimbursement  for  our  products
    inability  to  obtain  import  licenses
    changes  in  trade  policies  and  in  domestic  and  foreign tax policies
    possible  changes  in  export  or  import  restrictions  and
    the  modification  or  introduction  of  other  governmental  policies with
     potentially  adverse  effects

fluctuations  in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our
reported  sales  and  earnings  since our international sales and a significant
portion  of  our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not
in  us dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in
foreign  exchange  rates  we  had foreign currency transaction losses in recent
periods and may have further losses in the future  we expect that international
sales  will  continue  to  be  a  significant portion of our business and that a
significant  portion  of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated
in  australian  dollars

government  and  private  insurance  plans  may  not  reimburse patients for our
products  which  could  result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our
products  our  ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent
to  which  reimbursement  for  the  cost  of our products will be available from
government  health administration authorities private health insurers and other
organizations  these third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices
charged  for  medical  products  and  services  therefore even if a product is
approved  for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed
for  the  product  or  that  the  reimbursement  amount  will be adequate or if
adequate  will not subsequently be reduced  for example in some markets such
as  spain  france  and germany government reimbursement is currently available
for  purchase  or  rental  of our products but is subject to constraints such as
price  controls  or unit sales limitations  in other markets such as australia
and  the  united  kingdom  there  is  currently limited or no reimbursement for
devices  that treat sleepdisordered breathing conditions  additionally future
legislation  or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or
governmental  coverage and reimbursement particularly legislation or regulation
limiting  consumers  reimbursement  rights  may  harm  our  business

as  we  continue  to  develop  new  products  those products will generally not
qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved for marketing  in
the  united  states  we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers
and  to sleep clinics  we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and
other  third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products  however
we  are  still  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  governmental
reimbursement  programs  particularly  medicaid  and  medicare

in  particular  the  federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly
and  willfully  soliciting  receiving  offering  or  providing  remuneration
directly  or  indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the
furnishing  recommending  or arranging for a good or service for which payment
may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid
programs  the  government  has  interpreted  this  law  broadly to apply to the
marketing  and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us  many
states  and  other  governments  have  adopted  laws  similar  to  the  federal
antikickback  law  we  are  also subject to other federal and state fraud laws
applicable  to  payment from any third party payer  these laws prohibit persons
from  knowingly  and  willfully  filing  false  claims  or executing a scheme to
defraud  any  healthcare  benefit program including private third party payers
these  laws  may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information
on  coverage coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill
third party payers  any violation of these laws and regulations could result in
civil  and  criminal  penalties  including  fines

complying  with  food  and  drug  administration  and  other  regulations  is an
expensive  and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in
substantial  penalties  we  are  subject  to  various federal state local and
international  regulations regarding our business activities  failure to comply
with  these  regulations  could  result  in  among other things recalls of our
products  substantial  fines  andor  criminal  charges  against  us  and  our
employees

product  sales  introductions  or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a
result of the fda or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales to
decline  before  we  can  market  or  sell  a  new medical device in the united
states  we must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming
process  we  generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in
the  united  states under section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic
act  or  our  products  are  exempt  from the 510k clearance process  we have
modified  some  of  our  510k  approved products without submitting new 510k
notices  which  we do not believe were required  however if the fda disagrees
with  us and requires us to submit new 510k notifications for modifications to
our  existing  products we may be required to stop marketing the products while
the  fda  reviews  the  510k  notification  any  new  product introduction or
existing  product  modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous
fda  examination  process  for example in certain cases we may need to conduct
clinical  trials  of  a  new  product  prior  to  submitting  a  510k  notice
additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products
the  requirements  of  these  more  rigorous  processes  could  delay  product
introductions  and increase the costs associated with fda compliance  marketing
and  sale  of  our  products  outside  the  united  states  are  also subject to
regulatory  clearances  and approvals and if we fail to obtain these regulatory
approvals  our  sales  could  suffer

we  cannot  assure  you  that  any new products we develop will receive required
regulatory  approvals  from  us  or  foreign  regulatory  agencies

off  label  marketing  of  our  products  could result in substantial penalties
clearance  under  section  510k only permits us to market our products for the
uses  indicated  on  the labeling cleared by the fda  we may request additional
label  indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests
outright  require  additional expensive clinical data to support any additional
indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as
a  condition  of  clearance  if  the  fda  determines that we have marketed our
products  for  off label use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other
penalties

disruptions  in  the supply of components from our single source suppliers could
result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  sales and profitability  we purchase
uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers including
some  in  which  we  use  singlesource  suppliers  we cannot assure you that a
replacement  supplier  would be able to configure its components for our devices
on  a  timely basis or in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure
our  devices  to  integrate  the  replacement  part  a reduction or stoppage in
supply  while  a  replacement  supplier reconfigures its components or while we
reconfigure  our  devices  for  the replacement part would limit our ability to
manufacture  our devices which could result in a significant reduction in sales
and  profitability  we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate
to  meet  our  production  needs  during  any  prolonged interruption of supply

our  intellectual  property  may  not protect our products and our products may
infringe  on  the  intellectual  property rights of third parties  we rely on a
combination  of  patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect
our  intellectual  property  our  success  depends  in part on our ability to
obtain  and  maintain  united  states  and  foreign  patent  protection  for our
products  their  uses  and  our  processes to preserve our trade secrets and to
operate  without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties  we have
a  number of pending patent applications and we do not know whether any patents
will  issue  from  any of these applications  we do not know whether any of the
claims  in  our  issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any
significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially
valuable  legal  standards  regarding  the  validity  of patents and the proper
scope  of  their  claims  are  still evolving and there is no consistent law or
policy  regarding the valid breadth of claims  additionally there may be third
party  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to
our  products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete
with  our  products

we  face  the  risks  that

  third  parties  will  infringe  our  intellectual  property  rights
  our  nondisclosure  agreements  will  be  breached
  we  will  not  have  adequate  remedies  for  infringement
  our  trade  secrets  will become known to or independently developed by our
   competitors  or
  third  parties  will  be  issued  patents  that may prevent the sale of our
   products  or  require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for
   us to be  able  to  market  some  of  our  products

we  are  currently engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and defense
of  a  number of our patents  additional litigation may be necessary to enforce
patents  issued  to  us  to  protect our proprietary rights or to defend third
party  claims  that  we  have  infringed upon proprietary rights of others  the
defense  and  prosecution  of  patent claims including these pending claims as
well  as  participation  in  other interparty proceedings can be expensive and
time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us
if  the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse
we  could  be  subject  to  significant  liabilities  to third parties could be
required  to  obtain  licenses  from third parties or could be required to cease
sales  of  the  affected  products  additionally  the  laws  regarding  the
enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you
that  any  patent  issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws
will  provide  us  with  consistent  rights  and  benefits

we  are  subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope
and  amount  of  our  insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for
uninsured  claims  we  are  subject  to potential product liability claims as a
result of the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices  any product
liability  claim  brought against us with or without merit could result in the
increase  of  our product liability insurance rates  in addition we would have
to  pay  any  amount  awarded  by  a  court in excess of our policy limits  our
insurance  policies  have  various  exclusions  and thus we may be subject to a
product  liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage in which case
we  may  have  to pay the entire amount of any award  we cannot assure you that
our  insurance  coverage  will be adequate or that all claims brought against us
will be covered by our insurance  insurance varies in cost and can be difficult
to  obtain and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in
the  future on terms acceptable to us or at all  a successful product liability
claim  brought  against  us  in  excess  of  our insurance coverage if any may
require  us  to  pay  substantial  amounts  which  could  harm  our  business
our  quarterly  operating  results  are  subject to fluctuation for a variety of
reasons  our  operating  results  have  from  time  to  time  fluctuated on a
quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future  these
fluctuations  may  result  from  a  number  of  factors  including

     the  introduction  of  new  products  by  us  or  our  competitors
     the  geographic  mix  of  product  sales
     the  success  of  our  marketing  efforts  in  new  regions
     changes  in  third  party  reimbursement
     timing  of  regulatory  clearances  and  approvals
     timing  of  orders  by  distributors
     expenditures  incurred  for  research  and  development
     competitive  pricing  in  different  regions

if  a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will
be  unable  to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our
sales  will  decline  our  facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to
produce  our  products  would be costly to replace and could require substantial
lead  time  to  repair or replace  the facilities may be affected by natural or
man  made  disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster we would be
forced  to  rely  on  third party manufacturers  although we believe we possess
adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business
from  casualties  such  insurance  may  not  be  sufficient to cover all of our
potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms
or  at  all

delaware  law  provisions  in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could
make  it  difficult  for  another  company  to  acquire  us  provisions  of our
certificate  of  incorporation  may  have  the  effect of delaying or preventing
changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security
holders  in  particular  our board of directors is divided into three classes
serving  for staggered threeyear terms  because of this classification it will
require  at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority
of  our  board  of  directors

additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000
shares  of  preferred  stock  and  to  determine the price rights preferences
privileges  and  restrictions  including voting rights of those shares without
further  vote or action by the stockholders  under our stockholder rights plan
we  have  also  issued  purchase  rights to the holders of our common stock that
entitle  those  holders  to purchase our series a junior participating preferred
stock  at a discount under certain circumstances  the rights of the holders of
our  common  stock  will  be  subject  to and may be adversely affected by the
rights  of  the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future
the  issuance  of  preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or
preventing  a  change  in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a
premium  over  the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the
market  price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders
of  our  common  stock

you  may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our

located outside the united states  additionally two of our seven directors and
three  of our seven officers reside outside the united states along with all or
a  substantial  portion of the assets of these persons  as a result it may not
be  possible  for  investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any
liabilities  under  us  securities  laws  against our assets those persons or
their  assets  in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel that
some  doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on us

procedures  no  matter  how  well  designed  and  operated  can  provide  only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of
possible  controls  and  procedures

assets  as  allowed  under the standard the company adopted sfas 142 effective
july  1 2001  sfas 142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful  lives to no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at
least  annually

with  the  adoption  of  sfas  142  the company reassessed the useful lives and
residual  values  of  all  acquired  intangible  assets  to  make  any necessary
amortization  period  adjustments  based  on that assessment only goodwill was
determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the
amortization  period  or  residual  values  of  other  intangible  assets

the  company  conducted  its annual review for goodwill impairment in july 2003
in  conducting  our  review  of  goodwill  impairment  the  company  identified
reporting  units  being  components  of  our  operating segment as each of the
entities  acquired  and  giving  rise  to the goodwill  the fair value for each
reporting  unit was determined based on discounted cash flows and involved a two
step  process  as  follows

     g     goodwill  continued

step  1       compare  the  fair  value for each reporting unit to its carrying
value  including  goodwill  for  each reporting unit where the carrying value
including  goodwill exceeds the reporting units fair value move on to step 2
if  a reporting units fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is
performed  and  no  impairment  charge  is  necessary

step  2       allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable
tangible  and  nongoodwill intangible assets and liabilities  this will derive
an implied fair value for the goodwill  then compare the implied fair value of
the  reporting  units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units
goodwill  if  the  carrying  amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater
than  the  implied  fair  value  of  its  goodwill  an  impairment loss must be
recognized  for  the  excess

the  results  of  the  review  indicated  that  no  impaired  goodwill  exists

2003  the company intends to adopt sfas 150 effective july 1 2003 and does not
believe  that  the  adoption  will  have  a  material impact on its consolidated
financial  position  or  results  of  operation

in  april  2003  the  fasb  issued  sfas  149  amendment  of  statement 133 on
derivative  instruments  and  hedging  activities  which  amends  and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including certain

in  july  2002  the  fasb  issued sfas 146 accounting for restructuring costs
sfas  146  applies  to  costs  associated  with  an  exit  activity  including
restructuring  or  with  a disposal of longlived assets  those activities can
include  eliminating  or  reducing  product  lines  terminating  employees  and
contracts  and  relocating  plant  facilities  or personnel  under sfas 146 a
company  will  record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity  when  that  liability  is  incurred and can be measured at fair value

sfas  146 requires a company to disclose information about its exit and disposal
activities  the  related  costs and changes in those costs in the notes to the
interim and annual financial statements that include the period in which an exit
activity  is  initiated  and  in  any  subsequent  period  until the activity is
completed

sfas  146  is  effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated
after  december  31  2002  under  sfas  146  a  company  may  not restate its
previously  issued financial statements and sfas 146 grandfathers the accounting
for  liabilities  that  a  company had previously recorded under emerging issues
task  force issue 943  the adoption of sfas 146 did not have a material impact
on  the  results  of operations financial position or liquidity of the company

the  fasb  issued  sfas  145  rescission  of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64
amendment  of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections as of april 2002
sfas  145  rescinds sfas 4 and sfas 64 which required that all gains and losses
from  extinguishment  of  debt  be aggregated and if material classified as an
extraordinary  item  as a result gains and losses from debt extinguishment are
to  be  classified  as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria set forth in
apb  opinion no 30 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects
of  disposal  of  a  segment  of  a  business  and  extraordinary  unusual and
infrequently  occurring  events  and  transactions  sfas 145 also requires that
saleleaseback  accounting be used for capital lease modifications with economic
effects  similar  to  saleleaseback  transactions  the  company has classified
gains  from  the  extinguishment  of  debt  as  other income in its consolidated
statements  of  income

in  august  2001  the  fasb  issued sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets  for longlived assets to be held and used sfas
144  retains  the  requirements  of sfas 121 to a recognize an impairment loss
only  if  the  carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable from its
undiscounted  cash  flows  and  b measure an impairment loss as the difference
between  the  carrying  amount and fair value  further sfas 144 eliminates the
requirement  to  allocate  goodwill  to  longlived  assets  to  be  tested  for
impairment  describes  a  probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach to
deal  with  situations  in  which  alternative  courses of action to recover the
carrying  amount  of  a  longlived  asset are under consideration or a range is
estimated  for  the  amount  of  possible  future  cash flows and establishes a
primaryasset  approach  to  determine  the  cash flow estimation period  for
longlived  assets  to be disposed of other than by sale eg assets abandoned
exchanged  or  distributed to owners in a spinoff sfas 144 requires that such
assets  be  considered  held  and  used  until  disposed

     further  an  impairment  loss should be recognized at the date an asset is
exchanged  for a similar productive asset or distributed to owners in a spinoff
if  the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the company adopted sfas 144 on
july  1  2002  adoption  of the standard did not have a material impact on the
results  of  operations  financial  position  or  liquidity  of  the  company

as  allowed  under the standard the company has adopted sfas 142 effective july
1  2001  sfas  142  requires  goodwill  and  intangible assets with indefinite
useful  lives to no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at
least  annually

with  the  adoption  of  sfas  142  the company reassessed the useful lives and
residual  values  of  all  acquired  intangible  assets  to  make  any necessary
amortization  period  adjustments  based  on that assessment only goodwill was
determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the
amortization  period  or  residual  values  of  other  intangible  assets  in
accordance with sfas 142 the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill
impairment  in  july 2002  the results of the review indicated that no impaired
goodwill  currently  exists

in  june  2001  the  fasb  issued  sfas  143  accounting for asset retirement
obligations  which  requires  that  the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement  obligation  be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable  estimate of fair value can be made  the associated asset retirement
costs  would  be  capitalized  as  part of the carrying amount of the longlived
asset  and depreciated over the life of the asset  the liability is accreted at
the  end of each period through charges to operating expense  if the obligation
is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability the company will
recognize  a  gain  or  loss  on  settlement  the  provisions  of  sfas 143 are
effective  for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002  the initial adoption
of  sfas  143  did  not  have  a  material  impact on the results of operations
financial  position  or  liquidity  of  the  company

assets  noted  above  were reasonable at the time of acquisition and as at march
31  2003  no  assurance can be given however that the underlying assumptions
used  to estimate expected project revenues development costs or profitability
or events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated  for these
reasons  among  others  actual  results  may  vary from the projected results

16     business  acquisition  continued

fiscal  year  ended  june  30  2001  continued

the  acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  as  a purchase and accordingly the
results  of  operations  of map have been included in the companys consolidated
financial  statements  from  february  16  2001  an  amount  of 471 million
representing  the  excess  of  the purchase price over the fair value of the net
identifiable  assets  acquired  has  been  recorded  as  goodwill

purchased inprocess research and development of 177 million was expensed upon
acquisition  of  map  because  technological  feasibility  of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed
the  value  of  in  process  technology  was  calculated by identifying research
projects  in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established
estimating  the  costs  to  develop  the  purchased  in  process technology into
commercially  viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products  discounting  the  net  cash  flows to present value and applying the
reduced  percentage completion of the projects thereto  the discount rates used
in  the  analysis were between 27 and 33 and were based on the risk profile of
the  acquired  assets

all purchased research and development projects related to medical equipment for
the  treatment  of  sleep  disordered  breathing  primarily  relating  to  the
development  of  mask  interface  systems  and  autotitrating  devices  for  the
treatment  of obstructive sleep apnea and associated disorders  key assumptions
used  in  the analysis included gross margins ranging from 70 to 80 as of the
date of acquisition the mask interface systems are expected to be completed and
commercially available in 2002 and versions of the autotitrating devices between
2003  and  2005  these  projects  have  estimated  costs  to complete totalling
approximately  20  million

the  company believes that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible
assets  were  reasonable at the time of acquisition  no assurance can be given
however  that  the  underlying  assumptions  used  to estimate expected project
revenues  development  costs  or  profitability or events associated with such
projects  will transpire as estimated  for these reasons among others actual
results  may  vary  from  the  projected  results

the  following  unaudited  proforma financial information presents the combined
results  of operations of the company and map as if the acquisition had occurred
as  of  the beginning of the year ended june 30 2001 and after giving effect to
certain  adjustments  including amortization of goodwill and increased interest
expense  associated  with  debt funding the acquisition the proforma financial
information  does  not  necessarily reflect the results of operations that would
have  occurred had the company and map constituted a single entity during fiscal

other  litigation  in  addition  to  the matters described above in the normal
course  of  business  we  are  subject  to routine litigation incidental to our

certainty  we believe that their final outcome will not have a material adverse
effect  on  our  consolidated  financial  statements  taken  as  a  whole


19     inprocess  research  and  development  charge

map

on  acquisition  of map in february 2001 the company recognized as an expense a
charge of 177 million with respect to five inprocess research and development
programs  under  active  development  by  map  at date of acquisition  the five
projects  were

i     a  singlewalled  nasal  cushion  mask  system
ii    a  new  headgear  system
iii   standalone  active  humidifier
iv    an  autotitration  cpap  device  for  treatment  of  osa
v     a  new  osa  diagnostic  device

the  status  of  each  project  is  as  noted  below

i     singlewalled  nasal  cushion

the nasal cushion under development by map on acquisition was originally due for
release in october 2001  delays in the design and manufacturing process delayed
the  release  for  seven  months until april 2002  the delay in release of the
product  was  not  significant  over  its  expected  life cycle and has made no
significant  impact on the net return assumptions used in the initial inprocess
research  and development model  since release the product now referred to as
the  papillon  has  met  or  exceeded  all  sales  forecasts

ii     new  headgear

the  new  headgear product line was withheld to coincide with the release of the
papillion mask system in april 2002 and so was also seven months behind schedule
in projected release dates  since release the new headgear system has exceeded
original sales projections and continues to meet or exceed initial expectations

19     inprocess  research  and  development  charge  continued

iii     standalone  active  humidifier

due  to  other  priorities  and to the introduction of integrated humidification
flow  generator  devices  by a number of competitors during fiscal 2002 we have
delayed  the  standalone  humidifier  project

given  the  relatively  small  revenue  forecast  of  the  product  line  in the
inprocess  research and development model the financial impact of this project
is  not  material  to  resmed  or  the  net  return  of  the  map  acquisition

iv     auto  titration  cpap  device

the  main  product  development  effort of map since acquisition has been on the
completion  of  the  autotitration  cpap flow generator specified in the initial
inprocess research and development charge this project experienced some delays
due  to  the  complexity  of  the  software  algorithm  development  process and
associated electronics resulting in the product being released in november 2002

v     osa  diagnostic  device

maps  new  diagnostic  device  remains  on target for initial market release in
calendar  2003  although  the  forecasted  release  date  of  march 2003 was not
achieved  we  remain  confident  in  the  capacity of the device to enhance the
diagnostic  process  and  remain  confident  in the potential of the product to
significantly  impact  the treatment and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in
the  german  market

as  at  june  30  2003 three of the five programs have been completed with the
release  of  the  papillon  mask  system  upgraded  headgear  and  the magellan
automated  flow  generator cpap device  all three products are generating sales
revenue  consistent  with  our  original  expectations  and  assumptions used in
calculating  the  inprocess  research  and  development  charge  we  expect to
release  products  with  respect  to  both  remaining  inprocess  research  and
development  programs  over  the  next  twelvemonth  period which is generally
consistent  with  our  original  expectations

given  the  successful completion of the above research programs and performance
of  the associated product lines we remain confident in the assumptions used to
determine the inprocess research and development charge and as a result the net
return  of  the  map  acquisition

general

we  are  a  leading developer manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment
for  treating diagnosing and managing sleep disordered breathing or sdb  sdb
includes  obstructive  sleep apnea or osa and other respiratory disorders that
occur  during  sleep  when  we  were formed in 1989 our primary purpose was to
commercialize  a  treatment for osa developed by professor colin sullivan of the
university  of  sydney the current chairman of our medical advisory board this
treatment  nasal  continuous  positive  airway pressure or cpap was the first
successful  noninvasive treatment for osa cpap systems deliver pressurized air
typically  through  a nasal mask to prevent collapse of the upper airway during
sleep

since  the  development  of nasal cpap we have developed a number of innovative
products  for sdb including flow generators diagnostic products mask systems
headgear  and  other  accessories  our  growth  has  been fuelled by geographic
expansion  increased  awareness  of  sdb  as a significant health concern among
physicians  and  patients  and  our  research  and  product development effort

we  employ approximately 1250 people and sell our products in over 60 countries
through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors


corporate  history

resmed  inc  a  delaware corporation was formed in march 1994 as the ultimate
holding  company  for  our  domestic  australian  and  european  operating
subsidiaries  on  june  1  1995  we  completed  an initial public offering of
common  stock  and  on  june  2  1995 our common stock commenced trading on the
nasdaq  national  market  on  september  30  1999 we transferred our principal
public  listing  to the new york stock exchange trading under the ticker symbol
rmd  on november 25 1999 we established a secondary listing of our shares via
chess  depositary  instruments  or cdis on the australian stock exchange also
under  the  symbol  rmd  ten  cdis on the asx represent one share of our common
stock  on the nyse  on july 1 2002 we converted our asx listing status from a
foreign  exempt  listing  to  a  full  listing

our  australian subsidiary resmed holdings limited was originally organized in
1989 by dr peter farrell to acquire from baxter center for medical research pty
limited  or baxter the rights to certain technology relating to cpap treatment
as well as baxters existing cpap device business  baxter had sold cpap devices
in  australia  since  1988 having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987
from  dr  colin  sullivan

since  formation  we  have  acquired  a number of operating businesses with both
labhardt ag and servo magnetics inc acquired during fiscal 2002 on november 15
2001  and  may  14  2002 respectively  previously we have acquired map medizin
technologie gmbh dieter w priess medtechnik premium medical sarl innovmedics

distributors on february 16 2001 february 7 1996 june 12 1996 november 1
1997 and january 31 2000 respectively  during the 1999 fiscal year we made an
equity  investment  in  flaga  hf  based  in  iceland  we  now  market flagas

the  market

sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states rapid
eye  movement  or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem sleep rem
sleep  which  is  about  2025  of  total  sleep  experienced  by  adults  is
characterized  by  a high level of brain activity bursts of rapid eye movement
increased  heart  and  respiration rates and paralysis of many muscles nonrem
sleep  is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth stage
1  is  the  lightest  and  stage  4  is  the  deepest

the  upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of
upper  airway  muscles  normally during rem sleep and deeper levels of nonrem
sleep  upper  airway  muscles  relax  and  the airway narrows individuals with
narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the
upper  airway during sleep or apneas or near closures of the upper airways or
hypopneas  these  breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen
concentration causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen
or  increased  carbon  dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the
individual  subconsciously  arouses  from  sleep  causing the throat muscles to
contract  opening  the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen levels
increase  and  the  individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats
itself  sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour
while  these  awakenings  greatly impair the quality of sleep the individual is
not  normally  aware  of  these  disruptions

in its wake up america report to congress in 1993 the national commission on
sleep  disorders research estimated that approximately 40 million individuals in
the  united  states suffer from chronic disorders of sleep and wakefulness such
as  sleep  apnea insomnia and narcolepsy according to this report sleep apnea
is  the  most  common  sleep  disorder  affecting  approximately  20  million
individuals  in the united states  despite the high prevalence of osa there is
a  general  lack  of  awareness  of osa among both the medical community and the
general  public  it  is  estimated that less than 10 of those afflicted by osa
know the cause of their fatigue or other symptoms health care professionals are
often  unable  to  diagnose  osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific
symptoms  as  fatigue  snoring  and  irritability  are  characteristic  of osa

while  osa  has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population it is
predominant  among  middleaged  men  and  those  who  are obese smoke consume
alcohol  in  excess or use musclerelaxing drugs  in addition patients who are
being  treated for certain other conditions including those undergoing dialysis
treatment  or  suffering  from diabetes may have an increased incidence of osa
recent  studies  have  also  shown that sdb is associated with hypertension the
leading  risk  factor  for the development of stroke and heart disease and that
over 50 of post stroke patients and patients with congestive heart failure have
sdb


sleep  disordered  breathing  and  obstructive  sleep  apnea

sleep disordered breathing or sdb encompasses all physiological processes that
cause  detrimental breathing patterns during sleep  manifestations include osa
central  sleep  apnea  or  csa and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during
sleep  hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic
obstructive  lung  disease  neuromuscular  disease  and upper airway resistance
changes  osa  is  the  most  common  form  of  sdb

sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by osa can
lead  to  excessive  daytime  sleepiness  reduced cognitive function including
memory  loss  and  lack  of  concentration  depression  and  irritability  osa
sufferers  also  may  experience  an  increase in heart rate and an elevation of

                                   4
page

blood  pressure  during  the cycle of apneas  several studies indicate that the
oxygen  desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by
osa  may  be  associated  with  increased  risk  of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality  due  to  angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have been
shown  to  have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions
including  problem  solving  response  speed and visual motor coordination and
studies  have  linked  osa  to  increased  occurrences  of traffic and workplace
accidents

generally  an  individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is referred
by  a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation the diagnosis
of  osa typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep
clinic  or the patients home  during overnight testing respiratory parameters
and sleep patterns are monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate
and  blood oxygen levels these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep
disturbances  such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings  we estimate
that  there  are currently more than 2000 sleep clinics in the united states a
substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals  the number of sleep
clinics  has  expanded  significantly  from approximately 100 such facilities in
1985


existing  therapies

prior  to  1981  the  primary  treatment  for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical
procedure  to  cut  a  hole  in  the  patients windpipe to create a channel for
airflow  most  recently  surgery has involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
uppp  in  which  surgery  is performed on the upper airway to remove excess
tissue  and to streamline the shape of the airway or mandibular advancement in
which  the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patients airway  uppp alone
has  a poor success rate however when performed in conjunction with mandibular
advancement  a greater success rate has been claimed  this combined procedure
performed  by  highly  specialized surgeons is expensive and involves prolonged
and  often  painful  recovery  periods

nasal  cpap  by  contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa  nasal cpap
was  first  used  as  a  treatment  for  osa  in 1980 by dr colin sullivan the
chairman  of  our  medical  advisory board cpap systems were commercialized for
treatment  of  osa  in  the united states in the mid 1980s today use of nasal
positive  airway  pressure  is  generally acknowledged as the most effective and
least  invasive  therapy  for  managing  osa

during  nasal  cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal mask connected to a
small portable air flow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure
the  patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an
exhaust  port  in the mask  continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts
as  a  pneumatic  splint  to  keep  the  upper  airway  open  and  unobstructed

cpap  is  not a cure but a therapy for managing osa and therefore must be used
on  a daily basis as long as treatment is required  patient compliance has been
a  major  factor  in  the efficacy of cpap treatment  early generations of cpap
units  provided  limited  patient comfort and convenience  patients experienced
soreness  from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep
with  the  cpap  device  operating  at  the prescribed pressure  in more recent
years  product  innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been
developed  these  include  more  comfortable  mask  systems delay timers which
gradually  raise  air  pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily
bilevel  flow  generators  including  vpap systems which provide different air
pressures  for  inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make
the  airflow  more  comfortable  and  auto  titration  devices which reduce the
average  pressure  delivered  during  the  night

                                   5

business  strategy

we  believe  that  the  sdb  market will continue to grow in the future due to a
number  of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved understanding
of  the  role  of  sdb  treatment  in  the management of cardiac neurologic and
related  disorders  and  an  increase in homebased diagnosis our strategy for
expanding  our  business  operations  and  capitalizing on the growth of the sdb
market  consists  of  the  following  key  elements

continue  product  development  and  innovation  we  are  committed  to ongoing
innovation  in  developing  products for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb  we
have  been  a  leading  innovator of products designed to more effectively treat
apneas  increase  patient  comfort  and  encourage  compliance  with prescribed
therapy  for  example  in  1999 we introduced the mirage full face mask  this
mask  contains  an inflatable air pocket which conforms to the patients facial
contours creating a more comfortable and better seal  additionally in 2002 we
introduced  the  autoset  spirit  flow  generator  our  second  generation
autotitrating  device  that  adapts  to the patients breathing patterns to more
effectively  prevent  apneas  we believe that continued product development and
innovation  are  key  factors  to  our ongoing success approximately 14 of our
employees  are  devoted  to research and development activities  in fiscal year
2002  we  invested  149  million  or  73  of our revenues in research and
development

expand  geographic  presence  we  market  our  products in over 60 countries to
sleep  clinics  home  health care dealers and third party payers  we intend to
increase  our  sales  and marketing efforts in our principal markets as well as
expand  our  presence  into  new  geographic  regions

increase  public  and  clinical  awareness  we intend to continue to expand our
existing  promotional  activities to increase awareness of sdb and our treatment
alternatives  these  promotional  activities  target  the  population  with
predisposition  to  sdb as well as primary care physicians and specialists such
as  cardiologists  neurologists and pulmonologists in addition we also target
special interest groups including the national stroke association the american
heart  association  and  the  national  sleep  foundation

in  addition  during fiscal 2002 the company donated a total of 23 million to
the  resmed  sleep  disordered  breathing  foundations  in the united states and
australia  to  further  enhance research and awareness of sdb  the foundations
contributions  represent resmeds continuing commitment to core medical research
into sleep disordered breathing particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep
apnea

expand  into  new  clinical  applications  we  continually seek to identify new
applications  of  our  technology  for  significant unmet medical needs  sdb is
associated  with  a  number of symptoms beyond fatigue and irritability  recent
studies  have established a clinical association between osa and both stroke and
congestive  heart  failure  we are currently developing a device which has not
been  approved for sale in the united states for the treatment of cheynestokes
breathing  in  patients  with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain
close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new
medical  applications  for  our  products  and  technology

leverage  the experience of our management team and medical advisory board  our
senior  management  team has extensive experience in the medical device industry
in  general  and in the field of sdb in particular  our medical advisory board
is  comprised  of experts in the field of sdb including dr colin sullivan the
inventor  of  nasal  cpap  we intend to continue to leverage the experience and
expertise  of  these  individuals  to  maintain  our  innovative approach to the
development  of  products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems
caused  by  sdb

products

our  portfolio  of  products  for  the  treatment  of osa and other forms of sdb
includes  flow generators diagnostic products mask systems headgear and other
accessories

flow  generators

we produce nasal cpap vpap and autoset systems for the diagnosis titration and
treatment  of  sdb  the flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure
through  a  small  nasal  mask  or sometimes a fullface mask  our vpap units
deliver  ultraquiet  comfortable  bilevel  therapy  there  are  two  preset
pressures a higher pressure as the patient breathes in and a lower pressure as
the patient breathes out breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment
more comfortable particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for
those  with  impaired  breathing  ability  autoset  systems  are  based  on  a
proprietary  technology  to  monitor  breathing  that  can  also  be used in the
diagnosis  and  treatment  of osa  cpap and vpap flow generators together with
our diagnostic products accounted for approximately 58 57 and 60 of our net
revenues  in  fiscal  years  2002  2001  and  2000  respectively

accessories  and  other  products

to  enhance  patient comfort convenience and compliance we market a variety of
other  products and accessories these products include humidifiers such as the
sullivan  humidaire  which  connect  directly with the cpap vpap and autoset t
flow  generators  to  humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient  their
use  prevents  the  drying  of  nasal  passages that can cause discomfort other
optional  accessories  include  a  cold  passover  humidifier  carry  bags  and
breathing  circuits  map  also  offers  a  range  of accessories including the
twister  remote  an  intelligent  remote  control  for  use  in  the  sleep lab
environment  to  set  and  monitor  flow  generators  the aeroclick connection
system  which  allows  a  quick simple connectdisconnect between the mask and
cpap  air  delivery  source  and  the  aerofix  headgear  for  the  comfortable
adjustment  of  masks for cpap therapy  since the may 2002 acquisition of servo
magnetics  inc we have sold custom electric motors for use in data storage and
aerospace  applications


product  development  and  clinical  trials

we  have  a  strong  track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989 we
introduced  our first nasal cpap device since then we have been committed to an
ongoing  program of product advancement and development  currently our product
development  efforts  are  focused  on  not  only  improving our current product
offerings  but  also  expanding  into new product applications for example in
1997  we  introduced  the  mirage  mask  this mask was based on the innovative
bubble  mask  technology  introduced  in  1991  which used the principle of air
inflation  of  the  mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by
better  conforming  to  patient  facial  contours  additionally  in  1999  we
introduced  the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to
the  patients  breathing  patterns  to  effectively  prevent  apneas

we  continually  seek  to  identify  new  applications  of  our  technology  for
significant  unmet  medical  needs  sdb is associated with a number of symptoms
beyond  fatigue  and  irritability  recent  studies have established a clinical
association  between sdb and hypertension stroke and congestive heart failure
for  example  we are currently developing a device which has not been approved
for  sale  in the united states for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in
patients  with congestive heart failure  we also support clinical trials in the
united  states  germany  france  the  united  kingdom  and  australia

we  consult  with  physicians  at  major  sleep  centers throughout the world to
identify  technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these physicians
currently  serve  on  our  medical  advisory  board  new product ideas are also
identified  by our marketing staff direct sales force network of distributors
manufacturers  representatives  customers  and  patients  typically  our
internal  development  staff  then  performs  new  product  development

in  fiscal  years  2002 2001 and 2000 we invested 14910000 11146000 and
8499000  respectively  on  research  and  development


sales  and  marketing

our  products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells
the  products to the patient  the decision to purchase our products as opposed
those  of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more of the following
individuals  or  organizations  the prescribing physician and his or her staff
the  home  healthcare  dealer  the  insurer  and  the  patient
we  currently  market  our  products  in  over  60  countries using a network of
distributors  independent  manufacturers  representatives and our direct sales
force  we  attempt  to  tailor  our marketing approach to each national market
based  on  regional  awareness  of  sdb  as a health problem physician referral
patterns  consumer  preferences  and  local  reimbursement  policies

manufacturing

our  principal  manufacturing  facilities  are  located in sydney australia and
comprise  a  120000  square  foot  manufacturing  and  research and development
facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing
of  our  flow  generators masks and accessories of the numerous raw materials
parts  and  components  purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic
sleep  disorder  products  most are offtheshelf items available from multiple
vendors  we  generally  manufacture  to  our  internal sales forecasts and fill
orders  as  received  over  the last two years the manufacturing processes have
been  transformed  along  world  class  manufacturing  guidelines  to flow lines
staffed  by  dedicated  teams  each  team  is  responsible  for manufacture and
quality  of  their  product  group  and  decisions  are based on performance and
quality  measures  including  customer  feedback

our  quality  management  system  is  based  upon  the requirements of iso 9001
en46001 european medical standards fda quality system regulations for medical
devices  21  cfr  part  820 and the medical device directive 9342eec  our
sydney  australia  facility  is  accredited to iso 9001 and en46001 and our san

thirdparty  reimbursement

the  cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded
in  substantial  part by government and private insurance programs  although we
do  not  generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers
our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain
adequate  reimbursement  for  our  products

                                   11
page

in  the  united states our products are purchased primarily by home health care
dealers  hospitals  or  sleep  clinics  which  then invoice thirdparty payers
directly  domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid and corporate
health  insurance  plans  these payers may deny reimbursement if they determine
that  a  device is not used in accordance with costeffective treatment methods
or  is  experimental unnecessary or inappropriate  the longterm trend towards
managed  health  care  or  legislative  proposals  to reform health care could
control  or  significantly  influence  the  purchase of health care services and
products  and  could  result  in  lower  prices  for  our  products

in the united states we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers
and  to  sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental programs and
other  thirdparty  payers  directly  for  reimbursement  for  our  products
nevertheless  we  are  still  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  relating  to
governmental  programs  and  any  violation of these laws and regulations could
result  in  civil  and  criminal  penalties  including  fines

in  particular  the  federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly
and  willfully  soliciting  receiving  offering  or  providing  remuneration
directly  or  indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the
furnishing  recommending  or arranging for a good or service for which payment
may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid
programs  the  government  has  interpreted  this  law  broadly to apply to the
marketing  and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us  many
states  have adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law  we are also
subject  to  other  federal  and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any
thirdparty  payer  these  laws  prohibit  persons from knowingly and willfully
filing  false  claims  or  executing  a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit
program  including  private  thirdparty  payers  these  laws  may  apply  to
manufacturers  and  distributors who provide information on coverage coding and
reimbursement  of  their  products  to  persons who bill thirdparty payers  we
continuously  strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements
do  not  violate  these  laws  liability may still arise from the intentions or
actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental
agency  interpretation  of  the  laws

in  some  foreign  markets  such  as  spain  france  and  germany  government
reimbursement  is  currently  available  for  purchase or rental of our products
subject  however  to  constraints  such  as  price  controls  or  unit  sales
limitations  in australia and in some other foreign markets there is currently
limited  or  no  reimbursement  for  devices  that  treat  osa


service  and  warranty

we  generally  offer  onetotwo  year  limited warranties on our flow generator
products  warranties on mask systems are for 90 days  in most markets we rely
on  our  distributors  to repair our products with parts supplied by us  in the
united  states  home health care dealers generally arrange shipment of products
to  our  san  diego  facility  for  repair

we  receive  returns  of  our  products  from the field for various reasons  we
believe  that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels
typically  experienced  by  manufacturers  of  similar  devices  we provide for
warranties  and  returns  based  on  historical  data

competition

the  markets  for  our  products  are  highly  competitive  we believe that the
principal  competitive  factors  in  all  of  our  markets are product features
reliability and price  reputation and efficient distribution are also important
factors

we  compete  on  a  marketbymarket basis with various companies some of which
have  greater  financial  research  manufacturing and marketing resources than
ourselves  in  the  united  states  our  principal  market respironics inc
devilbiss  a  division  of sunrise medical inc and nellcor puritan bennett a
subsidiary of tyco inc are the primary competitors for our cpap products  our
principal  european  competitors  are  also  respironics devilbiss and nellcor
puritan  bennett  as  well  as  regional european manufacturers  the disparity
between  our  resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of
the  recent  trend  towards  consolidation  in  the  health  care  industry  in
addition  our  products  compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances
designed  to  treat  osa  and  other  sdb  related  respiratory conditions  the
development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in
our  products  becoming  obsolete  or  noncompetitive  resulting  in a material
adverse  effect  on our business financial condition and results of operations

any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete
for market acceptance and market share  an important factor in such competition
may  be the timing of market introduction of competitive products  accordingly
the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing
and  regulatory  clearance  processes  and  supply  commercial quantities of the
product  to  the  market  are  expected to be important competitive factors  in
addition  our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to
which  we  are  successful  in  protecting  our  patents  and other intellectual
property


patents  and  proprietary  rights  and  related  litigation

through  our  subsidiaries  resmed  limited  and map medizintechnik fur arzt und
patient  gmbh we own or have licensed rights to 72 issued united states patents
including  15  design  patents  and  116 issued foreign patents  in addition
there  are  90  pending  united  states  patent applications including 9 design
patent applications and 218 pending foreign patent applications  some of these
patents  and  patent  applications relate to significant aspects and features of
our  products  these include us patents relating to cpap devices delay timer
system  the  bubble  mask and an automated means of varying air pressure based
upon a patients changing needs during nightly use such as that employed in our
autoset  device

of  our  patents two united states patents and three foreign patents are due to
expire  in the next five years with one foreign patent due to expire in each of
the years 2004 2005 and 2007 and two united states patents in 2007  we believe
that  the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on
our  competitive  position

we  rely  on  a  combination  of  patents  trade  secrets  trade  marks  and
nondisclosure  agreements  to  protect  our  proprietary technology and rights
resmed  limited  is pursuing infringement actions against two of its competitors
and  is  investigating  possible  infringement  by  others  see item 3  legal
proceedings

additional  litigation  may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents issued to
us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of infringement by us
of  the  proprietary rights of others  patent laws regarding the enforceability
of  patents  vary from country to country  therefore there can be no assurance
that  patent  issues will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will provide
us  with  consistent  rights  and  benefits

government  regulations

our  products  are  subject  to  extensive regulation particularly as to safety
efficacy  and  adherence  to  fda quality system regulation or qsr and related
manufacturing standards medical device products are subject to rigorous fda and
other  governmental  agency  regulations in the united states and regulations of
relevant  foreign  agencies  abroad  the  fda  regulates  the  introduction
manufacture  advertising  labeling  packaging  marketing  distribution and
record  keeping  for  such  products  in  order to ensure that medical products
distributed  in the united states are safe and effective for their intended use
in  addition  the  fda  is  authorized to establish special controls to provide
reasonable  assurance  of  the  safety  and  effectiveness of most devices  non
compliance  with applicable requirements can result in import detentions fines
civil  penalties  injunctions  suspensions  or losses of regulatory approvals
recall or seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government
to  approve  product  export  applications  or  allow  us  to  enter into supply
contracts  and  criminal  prosecution

the  fda  requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new
indication  for use of an existing medical device obtain either a section 510k
premarket  notification  clearance  or a premarket approval or pma prior to it
being  introduced  into  the us market our products currently marketed in the
united  states  are  marketed  in reliance on 510k premarketing clearances as
either  class  i  or class ii devices the process of obtaining a section 510k
clearance  generally  requires  the  submission  of  performance  data and often
clinical  data  which  in  some cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the
device  is  substantially equivalent to a device that was on the market prior
to  1976  or  to  a  device  that has been found by the fda to be substantially
equivalent  to such a pre1976 device  as a result fda approval requirements
may  extend  the  development  process  for  a  considerable length of time  in
addition  in  some  cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory
panel  which  can  further  lengthen  the  process  the  pma process which is
reserved  for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate
device  and  for  high risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain
human  life  may  take  several  years and requires the submission of extensive
performance  and  clinical  information

as  a  medical  device  manufacturer  all  of  our  domestic  and  australian
manufacturing  facilities  are  subject  to inspection on a routine basis by the
fda  we  believe  that our design manufacturing and quality control procedures
are  in  substantial  compliance  with  the fdas regulatory requirements maps
facilities  are not subject to fda regulation because none of maps products is
currently  marketed  in  the  united  states

sales  of  medical  devices  outside the united states are subject to regulatory
requirements that vary widely from country to country  approval for sale of our
medical  devices  in  europe is through the ce mark process  where appropriate
our  products  are  ce  marked to the european unions medical device directive
under  the ce marketing scheme our products are classified as either class i or
class  ii  our  devices  are listed in the united states with fda in australia
with  the  therapeutic  goods  administration or tga and in canada with health
canada

on  may  14  2002  we  acquired  all  of  the  common stock of servo magnetics
incorporated  smi  through  a merger with our whollyowned subsidiary servo
magnetics  acquisitions  inc  for  total  consideration  including acquisition
costs of 326 million  consideration included the issue of 853448 shares for
fair  value  of  248 million with the balance of the acquisition price paid in
cash  upon  consummation  of  the  merger  the  surviving  corporation  servo
magnetics  acquisition  inc  changed  its  name  to  servo  magnetics  inc

the  acquisition  has  been  accounted  for  as  a purchase and accordingly the
results  of  operations  of smi have been included in our consolidated financial
statements  from  may  14 2002  the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value  of the net identifiable assets acquired of 19 million has been recorded
as  goodwill

purchased  inprocess  research  and  development  of 350000 was expensed upon
acquisition  of  smi  because  technological  feasibility  of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed
the  value  of  in  process  technology  was  calculated by identifying research
projects  in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established
estimating  the  costs  to  develop  the  purchased  in  process technology into
commercially  viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products  discounting  the  net  cash  flows to present value and applying the
reduced  percentage  completion of the projects thereto  the discount rate used
in  the  analysis  was  19  and  was  based on the risk profile of the acquired
assets

purchased  research and development projects related to electrical motor systems
used  in  medical  devices  and  health  equipment  key assumptions used in the
analysis  included  gross  margins  of  approximately  34  as  of  the date of
acquisition  new  motor  systems  for  use  in these devices are expected to be
completed  and  commercially  available  by  fiscal  2004  these  projects have
estimated  costs  to  complete  totalling  approximately  450000

we  believe  that  the  assumptions  used  to  value  the  acquired   intangible
assets  were  reasonable at the time of acquisition  no assurance can be given
however  that  the  underlying  assumptions  used  to estimate expected project
revenues  development  costs  or  profitability or events associated with such
projects  will transpire as estimated  for these reasons among others actual
results  may  vary  from  the  projected  results


tax  expense

our  income  tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income
is recognized  to date a substantial portion of our income has been subject to
income  tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30 in fiscal 2002 and was
34  in  fiscal  2001 and 2000 respectively  during fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000
our  effective  tax  rate  has  fluctuated  between  approximately  31  and
approximately  35  these fluctuations have resulted from and future effective
tax  rates  will depend upon numerous factors including the amount of research
and  development  expenditures  for  which  a  125  australian tax deduction is
available  the  level  of nondeductible expenses and the use of available net
operating  loss  carryforward  deductions  and  other  tax  credits  or benefits
available  to  us  under  applicable  tax  laws


fiscal  year  ended  june  30 2002 compared to fiscal year ended june 30 2001

net  revenues  net  revenue  increased  in  fiscal  2002 to 2041 million from
1552  million  in  fiscal  2001  an  increase  of 489 million or 32  this
increase  was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in unit sales of our flow
generators  and  accessories in both domestic and international markets and also
to  the  acquisition on february 16 2001 of map medizintechnologie gmbh map

gross  profit  gross  profit  increased  in  fiscal 2002 to 1332 million from
1048  million  in  fiscal  2001  an  increase of 285 million or 27  gross
profit as a percentage of net revenue declined in fiscal 2002 to 65 from 68 in
fiscal  2001  the  decline  in  gross margins reflects a change in geographical
sales  mix  after adjusting for map sales with a relatively higher percentage
of  domestic  sales  which  achieve  lower  margins  compared to international
markets  the  decline  also  reflects  that  gross  margins  in  our  acquired
subsidiary map are historically lower than the average margins achieved by our
company  as  a  whole

selling  general  and  administrative  expenses  selling  general  and
administrative  expenses  increased  in 2002 to 645 million from 494 million
for  2001 an increase of 151 million or 31  as a percentage of net revenue
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 was 32 consistent
with  fiscal 2001  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses
was  primarily  due  to the addition of 98 personnel in sales and administration
and  other  expenses  related  to  the increase  in  our  sales  sga in fiscal
2002 also included a provision of 10 million against an outstanding receivable
from  american  home  patient  inc ahp a significant customer who filed for
chapter  11 bankruptcy protection on july 31 2002  ahps filing for chapter 11
bankruptcy  protection  is  not  expected  to  materially  impact  our business

provision  for  restructure  in fiscal 2001 subsequent to the purchase of map
we  restructured  maps  french  activities  and  took  a charge of 06 million
associated with the closure of maps unprofitable french operations  we did not
incur  any  restructure  charges  in  fiscal  2002

in  process  research  and  development writeoff  in fiscal 2002 purchased in
process  research  and  development  of  04  million  was  expensed  upon  the
acquisition  of  smi  because  technological  feasibility  of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed

was  expensed  upon  acquisition of map because technological feasibility of the
products  under  development had not been established and no further alternative
uses  existed

donations  to  foundations  in  fiscal  2002  we committed 23 million to the
establishment  of  two resmed sleep disordered breathing foundations one in the
united  states  and  one  in  australia  the foundations overall mission is to
educate  both  the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated
sdbosa  particularly  as it relates to traffic and workplace accidents as well
as  cerebrovascular  and  cardiovascular  disease

research  and development expenses  research and development expenses increased
in  fiscal  2002 to 149 million from 111 million in fiscal 2001 an increase
of  38  million  or  34  as  a  percentage  of  net  revenue  research  and
development expenses increased to 73 in fiscal 2002 compared to 72 in fiscal
2001  the  increase  in  research and development expenses was due to increased
salaries  associated  with  an  increase  in personnel and increased charges for
consulting  fees  clinical  trials  and  technical  assessments  incurred  to
facilitate  development  of  new  products  and  also  includes  research  and
development  expenditures  of  map

other  income  expense  other income expense net increased in fiscal 2002
to a net income  of 34 million from net income of 13 million in fiscal 2001
the increase in other income primarily reflects a gain on extinguishment of debt
of  65  million  partially offset by increased net interest expense associated
with  our  convertible  notes  and  foreign  exchange  losses

income taxes  the companys effective income tax rate declined to approximately
313  in  fiscal  2002  from  approximately 344 excluding a nonrecurring in
process  research  and development writedown of 177 million and restructuring
charge of 06 million in fiscal 2001  the lower tax rate was primarily due to
the  lowering  of  the  corporate  income  tax rate in australia from 34 to 30
effective  july 1 2001  the company also benefits from a 125 tax deduction on
research  and  development  expenditures in australia which further reduces the
effective  tax  rate  on  australian  sourced  income

1556  million  in  fiscal  2000  an  increase  of 395 million or 34  this
increase  was  primarily  attributable  to an increase in unit sales of our flow
generators  and  accessories  in  north  and  latin  america  where net revenues
increased  to 799 million from 627 million and in europe where net revenues
increased  to  605  million from 405 million  net revenues were unfavorably
impacted  by  a  decline  in  european  foreign  exchange  rates

gross profit gross profit increased in fiscal 2001 to 1048 million from 786
million  in  fiscal  2000  an  increase  of 262 million or 33  the increase
resulted  primarily  from increased unit sales during fiscal 2001  gross profit
as  a  percentage  of  net revenues was 68 consistent with fiscal 2000  lower
flow generator selling prices were offset by a decline in the australian dollar
improved  manufacturing  efficiencies  and increased sales of higher margin mask
system  units

selling  general  and  administrative  expenses  selling  general  and
administrative  expenses  increased  in 2001 to 494 million from 370 million
for 2000 an increase of 124 million or 33  as a percentage of net revenues
selling  general  and  administrative  expenses  were  steady  in  fiscal 2001
compared  to  fiscal  2002  at  32  the  gross  increase  in  expenses was due
primarily  to  an  increase  to  471  from  281  in  the  number  of  sales  and
administrative  personnel  and  other  expenses  related  to the increase in our
sales

research  and development expenses  research and development expenses increased

26  million or 31  as a percentage of net revenues research and development
expenses  remained static in fiscal 2001 at 7  the dollar increase in research
and  development  expenses  was  due  primarily to an increase in clinical trial
costs  personnel  and  external  consultancy  fees

other  income expense  other income expense improved in fiscal 2001 to 13
million  from  10  million for fiscal 2000 an increase of 03 million  this
improvement  was due primarily to foreign currency gains incurred in our foreign
currency  hedging  structures  partially  offset by interest expense associated
with  the purchase of map  net foreign currency gains for fiscal 2001 were 20
million  compared  to  net  foreign  currency  losses  of  02 million in 2000

income  taxes  our  effective  income  tax  rate  for  fiscal  2001  before map
acquisition  charges  of  06  million  for  restructuring costs and inprocess
research  and  development  write off of 177 million was 344 down from 349
for  fiscal  2000  this  reduction  was  primarily  due  to  the  reduction  in
australian corporate tax rates from 36 to 34 on july 1 2000 and to additional
research  and  development  expenses  in  australia for which we received a 125
deduction  for  income  tax  purposes

critical  accounting  principles  and  estimates

in  response  to  the secs release numbers 338040 cautionary advice regarding
disclosure  about  critical  accounting  policies  and  338056  commission
statement  about managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results  of  operations  we  have identified the following critical accounting
policies  that  affect  the more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation  of  our  financial  statements  the  preparation  of  financial
statements  in  conformity  with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
our  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  revenues and expenses and
related  disclosures  of contingent assets and liabilities  on an ongoing basis
we  evaluate  our  estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful
accounts  inventory reserves warranty obligations impaired assets intangible
assets  income taxes revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation  we
state  these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at
relevant  sections  in this discussion and analysis  the estimates are based on
the  information  that  is  currently  available  to  us  and  on  various other
assumptions  that  we  believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual
results  could  vary  from  those  estimates  under  different  assumptions  or
conditions

                                   26
page

we  believe  that  the  following  critical  accounting policies affect the more
significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in the preparation of our financial
statements

1  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  we  maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts  for  estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to
make  required  payments  which  results in bad debt expense  we determine the
adequacy  of  this  allowance  by  continually  evaluating  individual  customer
receivables  considering  customers  financial  condition  credit history and
current  economic  conditions  if the financial condition of our customers were
to  deteriorate  resulting  in an impairment of their ability to make payments
additional  allowances  may  be  required

2  inventory  adjustments   inventories are stated at lower of cost or market
and  are determined by the firstin firstout method  we review the components
of  inventory  on  a  regular  basis for excess obsolete and impaired inventory
based  on  estimated  future  usage  and  sales  the likelihood of any material
inventory  writedowns  is  dependent  on changes in competitive conditions new
product  introductions  by  us  or our competitors or rapid changes in customer
demand

3  valuation  of  goodwill  intangible  and other longlived assets   we use
assumptions  in  establishing the carrying value fair value and estimated lives
of  our longlived assets and goodwill  the criteria used for these evaluations
include  managements  estimate  of  the  assets continuing ability to generate
positive  income  from  operations  and  positive  cash  flow  in future periods
compared  to  the  carrying  value  of  the  asset  as  well  as  the strategic
significance  of  any  identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives
if assets are considered to be impaired the impairment recognized is the amount
by  which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
useful  lives  and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our
estimate  of  the  period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be
used  by the company  factors that would influence the likelihood of a material
change  in  our  reported  results  include  significant  changes in the assets
ability  to generate positive cash flow loss of legal ownership or title to the
asset  a  significant  decline  in  the economic and competitive environment on
which  the  asset  depends  significant  changes  in  our  strategic  business
objectives  utilization  of the asset and a significant change in the economic
andor  political  conditions  in  certain  countries

4  valuation of deferred income taxes   valuation allowances are established
when  necessary  to  reduce  deferred  tax  assets to the amount expected to be
realized  the  likelihood  of  a material change in our expected realization of
these  assets  is  dependent on future taxable income our ability to deduct tax
loss  carryforwards  against future taxable income the effectiveness of our tax
planning  and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in
and  any  significant  changes  in  the  tax  treatment received on our business
combinations

5  provision  for  warranty   we  provide  for  the estimated cost of product
warranties  at  the  time the related revenue is recognized  the amount of this
provision  is  determined  by  using  a  financial  model  which  takes  into
consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with the
companys  different  products  this  financial model is then used to calculate
the  future  probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the
warranty  provision  although  we  engage  in  product improvement programs and
processes  our  warranty  obligation  is  affected by product failure rates and
costs incurred to correct those product failures  should actual product failure
rates  or  estimated  costs  to  repair  those  product failures differ from our
estimates  revisions  to  our  estimated  warranty provision would be required

amendment  of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections as of april 2002
which  is  effective  for  fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 but may be
adopted  early  sfas  145  rescinds sfas 4 and sfas 64 which required that all
gains  and  losses  from  debt  extinguishment  of  debt  be  aggregated and if
material  classified  as  an extraordinary item  as a result gains and losses
from debt extinguishment are to be classified as extraordinary only if they meet
the  criteria set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 30 reporting
the  results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a
business  and  extraordinary  unusual  and  infrequently  occurring events and
transactions  sfas 145 also requires that saleleaseback accounting be used for
capital  lease  modifications  with  economic  effects similar to saleleaseback
transactions  the  company  has  elected  to  early  adopt sfas no 145 and has
classified  gains  from  the  extinguishment  of  debt  as  other  income in its
consolidated  statements  of  income

in  august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets  for longlived assets to be held and used sfas
no  144 retains the requirements of sfas no 121 to a recognize an impairment
loss  only  if the carrying amount of a longlived asset is not recoverable from
its undiscounted cash flows and b measure an impairment loss as the difference
between  the  carrying  amount and fair value  further sfas no 144 eliminates
the  requirement  to  allocate  goodwill  to  longlived assets to be tested for
impairment  describes  a  probabilityweighted cash flow estimation approach to
deal  with  situations  in  which  alternative  courses of action to recover the
carrying  amount  of  a  longlived  asset are under consideration or a range is
estimated  for  the  amount  of  possible  future  cash flows and establishes a
primaryasset  approach  to  determine  the  cash flow estimation period  for
longlived  assets  to be disposed of other than by sale eg assets abandoned
exchanged  or  distributed  to owners in a spinoff sfas no 144 requires that
such  assets  be  considered  held  and  used  until  disposed  of  further an
impairment  loss  should  be  recognized at the date an asset is exchanged for a
similar  productive asset or distributed to owners in a spinoff if the carrying
amount  exceeds  its  fair  value  the company believes that it will not have a
material  impact  on the results of operations financial position and liquidity
of  the  company

in  july  2001  the  fasb  issued  sfas  no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets  as  allowed  under  the  standard  the  company  has  adopted sfas 142
effective  july  1 2001  sfas 142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite  useful  lives  to  no longer be amortized but instead be tested for
impairment  at  least  annually

with  the  adoption  of  sfas  142  the company reassessed the useful lives and
residual  values  of  all  acquired  intangible  assets  to  make  any necessary
amortization  period  adjustments  based  on that assessment only goodwill was
determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the
amortization  period  or  residual  values  of  other  intangible  assets

in  accordance with sfas 142 the company has completed its initial assessment of
goodwill  impairment  the  results  of  the  review  indicated that no impaired
goodwill  currently  exists

effective  july  1  2001  the  company  adopted  sfas  no  141  business
combinations  sfas 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used
for  all  business  combinations  initiated  after  june  30  2001

in  june  2001  the  fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations  which  requires  that  the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement  obligation  be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable  estimate of fair value can be made  the associated asset retirement
costs  would  be  capitalized  as  part of the carrying amount of the longlived
asset  and depreciated over the life of the asset  the liability is accreted at
the  end of each period through charges to operating expense  if the obligation
is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability the company will
recognize  a  gain  or  loss  on settlement  the provisions of sfas no 143 are
effective  for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002  the company believes
that  it will not have a material impact on the results of operations financial
position  and  liquidity  of  the  company






item  7a  quantitative  and  qualitative  disclosures  about market and business
risks


foreign  currency  market  risk

our  functional  currency  is  the us dollar although we transact business in
various  foreign  currencies including a number of major european currencies as
well  as  the  australian  dollar we have significant foreign currency exposure
through  both  our  australian  manufacturing activities and international sales
operations

we  have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency
options  to hedge foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities and
manufacturing  expenditure  the goal of this hedging program is to economically
guarantee  or  lock  in  the  exchange  rates  on our foreign currency exposures
denominated  in euros and the australian dollar  under this program increases
or  decreases in our foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets liabilities
and  firm  commitments  are  partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging
instruments

interest  rate  risk

we  are  exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the
return  on  investments

at  june  30  2002 we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in
financial  instruments  with  original  maturities  of three months or less  we
maintain  a  shortterm investment portfolio containing financial instruments in
which  the  majority  have  original maturities of greater than three months but
less  than twelve months  these financial instruments principally comprised of
corporate  obligations  are  subject  to interest rate risk and will decline in
value  if  interest  rates  increase  a  hypothetical 100 basis point change in
interest rates during the twelve months ended june 30 2002 would have resulted
in  approximately 03 million change in pretax income we do not use derivative
financial  instruments  in  our  investment  portfolio

statements  and  information  that are based on the beliefs of our management as
well  as  estimates and assumptions made by and information currently available
to  our  management  the  words  believe expect anticipate estimate

forwardlooking  statements  including in particular statements regarding the
development  and  approval  of  new  products  and  product applications market
expansion  pending  litigation  and  the  development  of  new  markets for the
companys  products  such  as  cardiovascular  and  stroke  markets  these
forwardlooking  statements  are  made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of
the  private securities litigation reform act of 1995  you are cautioned not to
place  undue  reliance on these forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking
statements  reflect  the views of our management at the time such statements are
made  and  are  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  uncertainties estimates and
assumptions  including without limitation and in addition to those identified
in the text surrounding such statements those identified below and elsewhere in
this  report  in  addition  important  factors  to consider in evaluating such
forwardlooking  statements include changes or developments in social economic
market  legal  or  regulatory  circumstances changes in our business or growth
strategy  or an inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry
or  the  economy  generally  the  emergence  of new or growing competitors the
actions  or  omissions  of  third  parties  including  suppliers  customers
competitors  and governmental authorities and various other factors should any
one  or  more  of  these  risks  or uncertainties materialize or the underlying
estimates  or assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary significantly
from  those  expressed  in  such forwardlooking statements and there can be no
assurance  that  the forwardlooking statements contained in this report will in
fact  occur


risk  factors

the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition or
results  of  operations  include  the  following

our  inability  to  compete  successfully  in our markets may harm our business

the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by
frequent  product  improvements  and evolving technology our ability to compete
successfully depends in part on our ability to develop innovative new products
and to be the first to market with those products the development of innovative
new  products  by  our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or
potential  cures  for the conditions that our products treat could result in our
products  becoming  noncompetitive  or  obsolete

additionally  some  of  our  competitors  have  greater financial research and
development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past several
years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in
the  markets  for  our  products industry consolidation could result in greater
competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are
acquired  by  other companies with greater resources than ours this competition
could  increase  pressure  on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or
could  cause  us  to increase our spending on research and development and sales
and  marketing  if  we  are unable to develop innovative new products maintain
competitive  pricing  and  offer  products  that  consumers  perceive  to be as
reliable  as those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease
which  would  harm  our  business

                                   31

our  business  depends  on  our ability to market effectively to dealers of home
health  care  products  and  sleep  clinics

we  market  our  products  primarily  to  home  health care dealers and to sleep
clinics  that  diagnose  osa  and  other  sleep disorders  we believe that home
health  care  dealers  and  sleep clinics play a significant role in determining
which  brand  of product a patient will use  for example in the united states
when  a physician at a sleep clinic prescribes the use of a product the patient
typically  purchases  the product from a home health care dealer  the physician
may  or  may  not prescribe a specific brand of product  if a specific brand is
prescribed  we  believe  the brand prescribed depends upon the brand of product
that  is  used  in the sleep clinic  if a specific brand is not prescribed the
home  health  care dealer may recommend a specific brand  occasionally even if
the  physician  prescribes  a  specific  brand  a  home  health care dealer may
substitute  a competitive product for the patient  we have limited resources to
market  to  the  more than 2000 us sleep clinics and the more than 4000 home
health  care  dealer  branch  locations  most  of  which use sell or recommend
several  brands  of  products  in  addition  home  health  care  dealers  have
experienced  price  pressures  as  government and thirdparty reimbursement have
declined  for  home  care  products  and home health care dealers are requiring
price  discounts  and  longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from
us  we  cannot  assure  you  that  sleep  clinic  physicians  will  continue to
prescribe  our  products  or that home health care dealers or patients will not
substitute  competing  products  when a prescription specifying our products has
been  written  the  success  of  our  business depends on our ability to market
effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics and to ensure that our
products  are  properly  marketed  and  sold  by  these  third  parties

we  intend  to  expand  our marketing activities to target the population with a
predisposition  to  sdb  as  well as primary care physicians and specialists we
cannot  assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing
awareness  of  our  products

if  we  are  unable  to support our continued growth our business could suffer

we  have  experienced  rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow the
complexity  of  our  operations  increases  placing  greater  demands  on  our
management  our  ability  to  manage  our  growth  effectively depends upon our
ability  to  implement  and  improve  our  financial  and management information
systems  on  a  timely  basis  and  to  effect  other  changes  in our business
unexpected  difficulties  during  expansion  the  failure to attract and retain
qualified  employees  the  failure  to  successfully  replace  or  upgrade  our
management  information systems the failure to manage costs or our inability to
respond  effectively  to  growth  or  plan  for future expansion could cause our
growth  to  stop  if  we  fail to manage our growth our business could suffer

if  we  fail to integrate our recent acquisition in germany with our operations
our  business  could  suffer

on  february  16 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of map located
near  munich  germany  we  are  currently  in  the  process of integrating our
operations  with those of map the integration requires significant efforts from
each  company  we may find it difficult to integrate the operations of map map
personnel  may  leave  map  because  of  the  acquisition  and  map  licensees
distributors  or  suppliers may terminate their arrangements with map or demand
amended terms to these arrangements additionally our management may have their
attention  diverted  while trying to integrate the two companies this diversion
or  these  difficulties in integration could have an adverse impact on us if we
are not able to successfully integrate the operations of map we may not realize
the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  map  acquisition

we  manufacture  substantially all of our products outside the united states and
sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets subjecting us to
various  risks  relating to international activities that could adversely affect
our  overall  profitability

sales  outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 51 48 and
46  of  our net revenues in fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively  we
expect  that  sales within these areas will account for approximately 50 of our
net  revenues in the foreseeable future  our sales outside of north america and
our operations in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties
and  risks  that  are  separate  and distinct from those we face in our domestic
operations  including

     fluctuations  in  currency  exchange  rates
     tariffs  and  other  trade  barriers
     compliance  with  foreign  medical  device  manufacturing  regulations
     reduction  in  third  party  payer  reimbursement  for  our  products
     inability  to  obtain  import  licenses
     changes  in  trade  policies  and  in  domestic  and foreign tax policies
     possible  changes  in  export  or  import  restrictions  and
     the  modification  or  introduction  of  other  governmental policies with
potentially  adverse  effects

fluctuations  in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our
reported  sales  and  earnings

since  our  international  sales  and a significant portion of our manufacturing
costs  are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars our reported
sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates we had
foreign  currency  transaction  losses  in  recent  periods and may have further
losses  in  the future we expect that international sales will continue to be a
significant  portion  of  our  business  and  that  a significant portion of our
manufacturing  costs  will  continue  to  be  denominated in australian dollars

government  and  private  insurance  plans  may  not  reimburse patients for our
products  which  could  result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our
products

our  ability  to  sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which
reimbursement  for  the  cost  of our products will be available from government
health  administration  authorities  private  health  insurers  and  other
organizations  these third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices
charged  for  medical  products  and  services  therefore even if a product is
approved  for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed
for  such  product  or  that  the  reimbursement  amount will be adequate or if
adequate  will  not subsequently be reduced for example in some markets such
as  spain  france  and germany government reimbursement is currently available
for  purchase  or  rental  of our products but is subject to constraints such as
price  controls  or  unit sales limitations in other markets such as australia
and  the  united  kingdom  there  is  currently limited or no reimbursement for
devices  that  treat  sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions
additionally  future  legislation  or  regulation  concerning  the  health care
industry  or  third  party  or  governmental  coverage  and  reimbursement
particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers reimbursement rights
may  harm  our  business as we continue to develop new products those products
will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all until they are approved
for  marketing  in  the  united  states we sell our products primarily to home
health  care  dealers  and  to  sleep  clinics  we  do not file claims and bill
governmental  programs  and  other third party payors directly for reimbursement
for our products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating
to  governmental  reimbursement  programs  particularly  medicaid and medicare

                                   33

in  particular  the  federal antikickback law prohibits persons from knowingly
and  willfully  soliciting  receiving  offering  or  providing  remuneration
directly  or  indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the
furnishing  recommending  or arranging for a good or service for which payment
may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid
programs  the  government  has  interpreted  this  law  broadly to apply to the
marketing  and  sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us many
states  have  adopted laws similar to the federal antikickback law we are also
subject  to  other  federal  and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any
third  party  payer  these  laws  prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully
filing  false  claims  or  executing  a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit
program  including  private  third  party  payors  these  laws  may  apply  to
manufacturers  and distributors who provide information on coverage coding and
reimbursement  of  their products to persons who do bill third party payors any
violation  of  these  laws  and  regulations  could result in civil and criminal
penalties  including  fines

complying  with  fda  and  other  regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming
process  and  any  failure  to  comply  could  result in substantial penalties

we  are  subject  to various federal state local and international regulations
regarding  the  testing manufacture distribution marketing promotion record
keeping and reporting of our products in particular our failure to comply with
fda  regulations  could  result in among other things recalls of our products
substantial  fines  andor  criminal  charges  against  us  and  our  employees

product  sales  introductions  or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a
result of the fda or similar foreign regulations which could cause our sales to
decline

before  we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we must
obtain  fda  clearance  which  can  be a lengthy and timeconsuming process we
generally  receive  clearance  from the fda to market our products in the united
states  under  section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act or our
products  are exempt from the 510k clearance process we have modified some of
our  510k approved products without submitting new 510k notices which we do
not believe were required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us
to  submit  new 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products
we  may  be  required  to  stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the
510k  notification  any  new  product  introduction  or  existing  product
modification  could  be  subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda examination
process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of
a  new  product  prior  to  submitting  a 510k notice additionally we may be
required  to  obtain  premarket  approvals for our products the requirements of
these more rigorous processes could delay product introductions and increase the
costs associated with fda compliance marketing and sale of our products outside
the  united  states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and
if  we  fail  to  obtain  these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we
cannot  assure  you  that  any  new  products  we  develop will receive required
regulatory  approvals  from  us  or  foreign  regulatory  agencies

off  label  marketing  of  our  products  could result in substantial penalties

clearance  under  section  510k only permits us to market our products for the
uses  indicated  on  the  labeling cleared by the fda we may request additional
label  indications for our current products and the fda may deny those requests
outright  require  additional expensive clinical data to support any additional
indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as
a  condition  of  clearance  if  the  fda  determines that we have marketed our
products  for  off label use we could be subject to fines injunctions or other
penalties

disruptions  in  the supply of components from our single source suppliers could
result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  sales  and  profitability

we  purchase  uniquely  configured components for our devices from singlesource
suppliers  we  cannot  assure  you that a replacement supplier would be able to
configure  its  components  for  our  devices  on  a  timely  basis  or  in the
alternative  that  we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the
replacement part a reduction or stoppage in supply while a replacement supplier
reconfigures  its  components  or  while  we reconfigure our components for the
replacement  part  would  limit  our  ability to manufacture our devices which
could  result  in  a significant reduction in sales and profitability we cannot
assure  you  that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs
during  any  prolonged  interruption  of  supply

our  intellectual  property  may  not protect our products and our products may
infringe  on  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  third  parties

we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements
to  protect  our  intellectual  property  our  success depends in part on our
ability  to  obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for
our  products their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to
operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties we have a
number  of  pending  patent applications and we do not know whether any patents
will  issue  from  any  of these applications we do not know whether any of the
claims  in  our  issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any
significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially
valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope
of  their  claims  are  still evolving and there is no consistent law or policy
regarding  the  valid  breadth of claims additionally there may be third party
patents  patent  applications  and  other intellectual property relevant to our
products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with
our  products

we  face  the  risks  that

     third  parties  will  infringe  our  intellectual  property  rights
     our  nondisclosure  agreements  will  be  breached
     we  will  not  have  adequate  remedies  for  infringement
     our  trade  secrets will become known to or independently developed by our
competitors  or
     any  third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our
products  or  require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to
be  able  to  market  some  of  our  products

we  are  currently engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and defense
of  a  number  of our patents additional litigation may be necessary to enforce
patents  issued  to  us  to  protect our proprietary rights or to defend third
party  claims  that  we  have  infringed  upon proprietary rights of others the
defense  and  prosecution  of  patent claims including these pending claims as
well  as  participation  in  other interparty proceedings can be expensive and
time consuming even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us
if  the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse
we  could  be  subject  to  significant  liabilities  to third parties could be
required  to  obtain  licenses  from third parties or could be required to cease
sales  of  the  affected  products  additionally  the  laws  regarding  the
enforceability of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you
that  any  patent  issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws
will  provide  us  with  consistent  rights  and  benefits

we  are subject to product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount
of  our  insurance  coverage  which  would expose us to liability for uninsured
claims

we  are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design
manufacture  and  marketing  of  medical  devices  any  product liability claim
brought  against  us with or without merit could result in the increase of our
product  liability insurance rates in addition we would have to pay any amount
awarded  by  a court in excess of our policy limits our insurance policies have
various  exclusions and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for
which  we  have  no  insurance  coverage  in which case we may have to pay the
entire  amount  of  any  award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage
will  be  adequate  or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our
insurance  insurance  varies  in  cost  and  can be difficult to obtain and we
cannot  assure  you  that  we  will be able to obtain insurance in the future on
terms  acceptable  to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought
against  us  in  excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to pay
substantial  amounts  which  could  harm  our  business

our  business  could  suffer  if  we  lose  the  services  of key members of our
management

we  are  dependent  upon  the  continued  services  of key members of our senior
management  and  a  limited number of key employees and consultants the loss of
the  services  of  any  one of these individuals could significantly disrupt our
operations  additionally  our future success will depend among other factors
on  our  ability  to  continue  to  hire  and  retain  the  necessary  qualified
scientific  technical  and  managerial personnel we compete for such personnel
with  numerous  other  companies  academic  institutions  and  organizations

our  quarterly  operating  results  are  subject to fluctuation for a variety of
reasons

our  operating  results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly basis
and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these fluctuations may
result  from  a  number  of  factors  including


     the  introduction  of  new  products  by  us  or  our  competitors

     the  geographic  mix  of  product  sales

     the  success  of  our  marketing  efforts  in  new  regions

     changes  in  third  party  reimbursement

     timing  of  regulatory  clearances  and  approvals

     timing  of  orders  by  distributors

     expenditures  incurred  for  research  and  development

     competitive  pricing  in  different  regions

     seasonality

     the  cost  and  effect  of  promotional  and  marketing  programs  and

     the  effect  of  foreign  currency  transaction  gains  or  losses

if  a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will
be  unable  to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our
sales  will  decline

we  manufacture  a  significant  portion  of  our  products in our facilities in
australia  these  facilities  and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce
our  products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time
to  repair  or  replace  the  facilities may be affected by natural or man made
disasters  and in the event it was affected by a disaster we would be forced to
rely  on  third  party  manufacturers  although  we believe we possess adequate
insurance  for  damage  to  our property and the disruption of our business from
casualties  such  insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential
losses  and  may  not  continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at
all

delaware  law  provisions  in our charter and our shareholder rights plan could
make  the  acquisition  of  our  company  by  another  company  more  difficult

provisions  of  our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying
or  preventing  changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us
or  our  securityholders  in particular our board of directors is divided into
three  classes  serving  for  staggered  threeyear  terms  because  of  this
classification  it  will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors
constituting  a  majority  of  our  board  of  directors

additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2000000
shares  of  preferred  stock  and  to  determine the price rights preferences
privileges  and  restrictions  including voting rights of those shares without
further  vote or action by the stockholders  under our stockholder rights plan
we  have  also  issued  purchase  rights to the holders of our common stock that
entitle  those  holders  to purchase our series a junior participating preferred
stock  at a discount under certain circumstances  the rights of the holders of
our  common  stock  will  be  subject  to and may be adversely affected by the
rights  of  the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future
the  issuance  of  preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or
preventing  a  change  in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a
premium  over  the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the
market  price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders
of  our  common  stock

you  may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some of our
assets  or  officers  and  directors

a  substantial  portion  of  our  assets  are located outside the united states
additionally  two of our seven directors and three of our eight officers reside
outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion of the assets
of  these  persons as a result it may not be possible for investors to enforce
judgments  of us courts relating to any liabilities under us securities laws
against  our  assets  those persons or their assets  in addition we have been
advised  by  our  australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of
investors to pursue claims based on us securities laws against these assets or
these  persons  in  australian  courts

purchased  inprocess  research and development of 17677000 was expensed upon
acquisition  of  map  because  technological  feasibility  of the products under
development  had  not  been established and no further alternative uses existed
the  value  of  in  process  technology  was  calculated by identifying research
projects  in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established
estimating  the  costs  to  develop  the  purchased  in  process technology into
commercially  viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products  discounting  the  net  cash  flows to present value and applying the
reduced  percentage completion of the projects thereto  the discount rates used
in  the  analysis were between 27 and 33 and were based on the risk profile of
the  acquired  assets

all purchased research and development projects related to medical equipment for
the  treatment  of  sleep  disordered  breathing  primarily  relating  to  the
development  of  mask  interface  systems  and  autotitrating  devices  for  the
treatment  of obstructive sleep apnea and associated disorders  key assumptions
used  in  the analysis included gross margins ranging from 70 to 80 as of the
date of acquisition the mask interface systems are expected to be completed and
commercially available in 2002 and versions of the autotitrating devices between
2003  and  2005  these  projects  have  estimated  costs  to complete totalling
approximately  20  million

the  company believes that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible
assets  were  reasonable at the time of acquisition  no assurance can be given
however  that  the  underlying  assumptions  used  to estimate expected project
revenues  development  costs  or  profitability or events associated with such
projects  will transpire as estimated  for these reasons among others actual
results  may  vary  from  the  projected  results

the  following  unaudited  proforma financial information presents the combined
results  of operations of the company and map as if the acquisition had occurred
as  of the beginning of the years ended june 30 2001 and 2000 respectively and
after  giving  effect to certain adjustments including amortization of goodwill
and increased interest expense associated with debt funding the acquisition the
proforma  financial  information  does  not  necessarily reflect the results of
operations that would have occurred had the company and map constituted a single
entity  during  such  years

17     legal  actions

the  company  is currently engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and
defense  of  certain  of  its  patents

in  january  1995  the  company filed a complaint in the united states district
court  for the southern district of california seeking monetary damages from and
injunctive  relief  against respironics for alleged infringement of three resmed
patents  in  february  1995 respironics filed a complaint in the united states
district  court  for  the  western  district of pennsylvania against the company
seeking  a  declaratory  judgment  that  respironics does not infringe claims of
these patents and that the companys patents are invalid and unenforceable  the
two actions were combined and are proceeding in the united states district court
for  the  western  district of pennsylvania  in june 1996 the company filed an
additional  complaint  against  respironics  for infringement of a fourth resmed
patent and that complaint was consolidated with the earlier action  as of this
date  respironics  has  brought  three  partial  summary  judgment  motions for
noninfringement  of  the  resmed  patents  the  court  has granted each of the
motions  in  december  1999  in response to the courts ruling on respironics
third  summary judgment motion the parties jointly stipulated to a dismissal of
charges  of  infringement  under the fourth resmed patent with resmed reserving
the  right to reassert the charges in the event of a favorable ruling on appeal
it  is  resmeds  intention to appeal the summary judgment rulings after a final
judgment  in  the consolidated litigation has been entered in the district court
proceedings

in  january  2001  map  medizintechnologie  gmbh  filed a lawsuit in the civil
chamber  of  munich  court  against hofrichter gmbh seeking actual and exemplary
monetary  damages  for  the  unauthorized  and  infringing  use of the companys
trademarks  and  patents  an  initial  decision  has been made in favor of map
hofrichter  has  filed  an appeal and have sort court determination that the map
patents  do  not  apply  to  certain  hofrichter  products

diego against fisher  paykel healthcare  the resmed complaint seeks a judgment
that  selected  fisher    paykel  healthcare mask products aclaim and aclaim 2
masks  infringe  patents  held  by  resmed  the  complaint further charges the
defendant  with  the  copying  of resmed proprietary mask technology and alleges
trade  dress and common law violations relating to the appearance of resmed mask
products

while  the  company  is prosecuting the above actions there can be no assurance
that  the  company  will  be  successful

      the market

      sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states
      rapid eye movement or rem sleep and nonrapid eye movement or nonrem
      sleep rem sleep which is about 2025 of total sleep experienced by
      adults is characterized by a high level of brain activity bursts of
      rapid eye movement increased heart and respiration rates and paralysis
      of many muscles nonrem sleep is subdivided into four stages that
      generally parallel sleep depth stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the
      deepest

      the upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active
      contraction of upper airway muscles normally during rem sleep and deeper
      levels of nonrem sleep upper airway muscles relax and the airway
      narrows individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are
      prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep or apneas
      or near closures of the upper airways or hypopneas these breathing
      irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration causing
      the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased
      carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond typically the
      individual subconsciously arouses from sleep causing the throat muscles
      to contract opening the airway after a few gasping breaths blood oxygen
      levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the
      cycle repeats itself sufferers of osa typically experience ten or more
      such cycles per hour while these awakenings greatly impair the quality of
      sleep the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions

      in its wake up america report to congress in 1993 the national
      commission on sleep disorders research estimated that approximately 40
      million individuals in the united states suffer from chronic disorders of
      sleep and wakefulness such as sleep apnea insomnia and narcolepsy
      according to this report sleep apnea is the most common sleep disorder
      affecting approximately 20 million individuals in the united states
      despite the high prevalence of osa there is a general lack of awareness
      of osa among both the medical community and the general public it is
      estimated that less than 10 of those afflicted by osa know the cause of
      their fatigue or other symptoms health care professionals are often
      unable to diagnose osa because they are unaware that such nonspecific
      symptoms as fatigue snoring and irritability are characteristic of osa

      while osa has been diagnosed in a broad crosssection of the population
      it is predominant among middleaged men and those who are obese smoke
      consume alcohol in excess or use musclerelaxing drugs in addition
      patients who are being treated for certain other conditions including
      those undergoing dialysis treatment or suffering from diabetes may be
      medically predisposed to osa recent studies have also shown that sdb is
      associated with hypertension the leading risk factor for the development
      of stroke and heart disease and that over 50 of post stroke patients and
      patients with congestive heart failure have sdb

      sleep disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea

      sleep disordered breathing or sdb encompasses all physiological
      processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep
      manifestations include osa central sleep apnea or csa and
      hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep hypoventilation
      syndromes are generally associated with obesity chronic obstructive lung
      disease neuromuscular disease and upper airway resistance changes osa is
      the most common form of sdb

      sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by
      osa can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness reduced cognitive function
      including memory loss and lack of concentration depression and
      irritability osa sufferers also may experience an increase in heart rate
      and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas several
      studies indicate that the oxygen

                                       3
page

      desaturation increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by
      osa may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality due to angina stroke and heart attack patients with osa have
      been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive
      functions including problem solving response speed and visual motor
      coordination and studies have linked osa to increased occurrences of
      traffic and workplace accidents

      generally an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of osa is
      referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation
      the diagnosis of osa typically requires monitoring the patient during
      sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patients home during overnight
      testing respiratory parameters and sleep patterns are monitored along
      with other vital signs such as blood pressure heart rate and blood oxygen
      levels these tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep
      disturbances such as apneas hypopneas or subconscious awakenings we
      estimate that there are currently more than 2000 sleep clinics in the
      united states a substantial portion of which are affiliated with
      hospitals the number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from
      approximately 100 such facilities in 1985

      existing therapies

      prior to 1981 the primary treatment for osa was a tracheotomy a surgical
      procedure to cut a hole in the patients windpipe to create a channel for
      airflow most recently surgery has involved either
      uvulopalatopharyngoplasty uppp in which surgery is performed on the
      upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the
      airway or mandibular advancement in which the lower jaw is moved forward
      to widen the patients airway uppp alone has a poor success rate
      however when performed in conjunction with mandibular advancement a
      greater success rate has been claimed this combined procedure performed
      by highly specialized surgeons is expensive and involves prolonged and
      often painful recovery periods

      nasal cpap by contrast is a noninvasive means of treating osa nasal
      cpap was first used as a treatment for osa in 1980 by dr colin sullivan
      the chairman of our medical advisory board cpap systems were
      commercialized for treatment of osa in the united states in the mid
      1980s today use of nasal positive airway pressure is generally
      acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing
      osa

      during nasal cpap treatment a patient sleeps with a nasal mask connected
      to a small portable air flow generator that delivers room air at a
      positive pressure  the patient breathes in air from the flow generator
      and breathes out through an exhaust port in the mask  continuous air
      pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the
      upper airway open and unobstructed

      cpap is not a cure but a therapy for managing osa and therefore must be
      used on a daily basis as long as treatment is required  patient
      compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of cpap treatment
      early generations of cpap units provided limited patient comfort and
      convenience  patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal
      masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the cpap device operating at
      the prescribed pressure  in more recent years product innovations to
      improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed these include
      more comfortable mask systems delay timers which gradually raise air
      pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily bilevel flow
      generators including vpap systems which provide different air pressures
      for inhalation and exhalation heated humidification systems to make the
      airflow more comfortable and autotitration devices which reduce the
      average pressure delivered during the night

      business strategy

      we believe that the sdb market will continue to grow in the future due to
      a number of factors including increasing awareness of osa improved
      understanding of the role of sdb treatment in the

                                       4
page

      management of cardiac neurologic and related disorders and an increase
      in homebased diagnosis our strategy for expanding our business
      operations and capitalizing on the growth of the sdb market consists of
      the following key elements

        continue product development and innovation we are committed to
         ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and
         treatment of sdb we have been a leading innovator of products designed
         to more effectively treat apneas increase patient comfort and
         encourage compliance with prescribed therapy for example in 1997 we
         introduced the mirage mask this mask contains an inflatable air
         pocket which conforms to the patients facial contours creating a
         more comfortable and better seal additionally in 1999 we introduced
         the autoset t flow generator an autotitrating device that adapts to
         the patients breathing patterns to more effectively prevent apneas we
         believe that continued product development and innovation are key
         factors to our ongoing success approximately 14 of our employees are
         devoted to research and development activities in fiscal year 2001 we
         invested 111 million or 72 of our revenues in research and
         development

        expand geographic presence we market our products in over 60 countries
         to sleep clinics home health care dealers and third party payers we
         intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal
         markets as well as expand our presence into new geographic regions
         for example our acquisition of map enhances our position in europe
         particularly in germany the second largest market worldwide for osa
         products

        increase public and clinical awareness we intend to continue to expand
         our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of sdb and
         our treatment alternatives these promotional activities target the
         population with predisposition to sdb as well as primary care
         physicians and specialists such as cardiologists neurologists and
         pulmonologists in addition we also target special interest groups
         including the national stroke association the american heart
         association and the national sleep foundation

        expand into new clinical applications we continually seek to identify
         new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs
         sdb is associated with a number of symptoms beyond fatigue and
         irritability in particular recent studies have established a clinical
         association between osa and stroke and congestive heart failure we are
         currently developing a device which has not been approved for sale in
         the united states for the treatment of cheynestokes breathing in
         patients with congestive heart failure in addition we maintain close
         working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore
         new medical applications for our products and technology

        leverage the experience of our management team and medical advisory
         board our senior management team has extensive experience in the
         medical device industry in general and in the field of sdb in
         particular our medical advisory board is comprised of experts in the
         field of sdb including dr colin sullivan the inventor of nasal cpap
         we intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these
         individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of
         products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused
         by sdb

      flow generators
      we produce nasal cpap vpap and autoset systems for the diagnosis
      titration and treatment of sdb the flow generator systems deliver
      positive airway pressure through a small nasal mask or sometimes a full
      face mask  our vpap units deliver ultraquiet comfortable bilevel
      therapy there are two preset pressures a higher pressure as the patient
      breathes in and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out breathing
      out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable
      particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with
      impaired breathing ability autoset systems are based on a proprietary
      technology to monitor breathing that can also be used in the diagnosis and
      treatment of osa  cpap and vpap flow generators together with our
      diagnostic products accounted for approximately 57 60 and 64 of our
      net revenues in fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

      we have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market in 1989
      we introduced our first nasal cpap device since then we have been
      committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development
      currently our product development efforts are focused on not only
      improving our current product offerings but also expanding into new
      product applications for example in 1997 we introduced the mirage mask
      this mask was based on the innovative bubble mask technology introduced in
      1991 which used the principle of air inflation of the mask cushion to
      create a more comfortable and better seal by better conforming to patient
      facial contours additionally in 1999 we introduced the autoset t flow
      generator an autotitrating device that adapts to the patients breathing
      patterns to effectively prevent apneas

      we continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for
      significant unmet medical needs sdb is associated with a number of
      symptoms beyond fatigue and irritability in particular recent studies
      have established a clinical association between sdb and stroke and
      congestive heart failure for example we are currently developing a
      device which has not been approved for sale in the united states for the
      treatment of cheynestokes breathing in patients with congestive heart
      failure we also support clinical trials in the united states germany
      france the united kingdom and australia

      we consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to
      identify technological trends in the treatment of sdb some of these
      physicians currently serve on our medical advisory board new product
      ideas are also identified by our marketing staff direct sales force
      network of distributors manufacturers representatives customers and
      patients typically our internal development staff then performs new
      product development

      in fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999 we invested 11146000 8499000
      and 6542000 respectively on research and development


      sales and marketing

      our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then
      sells the products to the patient the decision to purchase our products
      as opposed those of our competitors is made or influenced by one or more
      of the following individuals or organizations the prescribing physician
      and his or her staff the home healthcare dealer the insurer and the
      patient

      we currently market our products in over 60 countries using a network of
      distributors independent manufacturers representatives and our direct
      sales force we attempt to tailor our marketing

      approach to each national market based on regional awareness of sdb as a
      health problem physician referral patterns consumer preferences and
      local reimbursement policies

      north america and latin america

      in the united states our sales and marketing activities are conducted
      through a field sales organization made up of regional territory
      representatives program development specialists and diagnostic system
      specialists regional sales directors and independent manufacturers
      representatives our united states field sales organization markets and
      sells products to more than 4000 home health care dealer branch locations
      throughout the united states our direct sales force receives a base
      salary plus commissions while our independent sales representatives
      receive higher commissions but no base salary

      we also promote and market our products directly to sleep clinics
      patients who are diagnosed with osa and prescribed cpap treatment are
      typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home health care
      dealer to fill the prescription the home health care dealer in
      consultation with the referring physician will assist the patient in
      selecting the equipment fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set
      the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level in the united states
      our sales employees and manufacturers representatives are managed by two
      regional sales managers a director of sales and ultimately our senior
      vice president us sales and marketing

      our canadian and latin american sales are conducted through independent
      distributors sales in north america and latin america accounted for 52
      54 and 57 of our net revenues for fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999
      respectively

      europe

      we market our products in most major european countries we have wholly
      owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom germany france and sweden and
      we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of
      europe distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge
      of respiratory medicine and a commitment to sdb therapy in each country
      in which we have a subsidiary a local senior manager is responsible for
      direct national sales map conducts its sales efforts through a direct
      sales force

      our executive vice president is responsible for coordination of all
      european activities and in conjunction with local management the direct
      sales activity in europe sales in europe accounted for 39 35 and 34
      of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999
      respectively as a result of the map acquisition we expect european sales
      to increase as a percentage of total net revenues in the near future

      australiarest of world

      marketing in australia and the rest of the world is the responsibility of
      our executive vice president sales in australia and the rest of the world
      accounted for 9 11 and 9 of our total net revenues for the fiscal
      years ended june 30 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

      other marketing efforts

      in addition to our sales efforts we work with the following organizations
      to promote public and clinical awareness of sdb and osa

        national stroke association we have developed a strategic alliance
         with the national stroke association to increase awareness about the
         high prevalence of sdb in the stroke survivor population

                                       9
page

        american heart association we are working closely with the western
         affiliates of the american heart association on a number of local
         programs to increase awareness and education about sdb we are also in
         discussions with the national american heartamerican stroke
         associations regarding national programs initially targeting clinicians
         on the impact of sdb on both heart disease and stroke patients as well
         as its role in the development of hypertension a major risk factor for
         both heart disease and stroke

        national sleep foundation the national sleep foundation is a non
         profit organization dedicated to improving public health and safety by
         raising the level of awareness and education toward sleep related
         programs and research we have been an active corporate partner and
         have supported the national sleep foundation for a number of years

      we believe that our affiliations and continued work with these
      organizations raises the awareness of sdb as a significant health concern

      manufacturing

      our principal manufacturing facilities are located in sydney australia
      and comprise a 120000 square foot manufacturing and research and
      development facility our manufacturing operations consist primarily of
      assembly and testing of our flow generators masks and accessories of the
      numerous raw materials parts and components purchased for assembly of our
      therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products most are offtheshelf
      items available from multiple vendors we generally manufacture to our
      internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received our quality control
      group performs tests at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to ensure
      compliance with our specifications

      our quality management system is based upon the requirements of iso 9001
      en46001 european medical standards fda quality system regulations for
      medical devices 21 cfr part 820 and the medical device directive
      9342eec  our sydney australia facility is accredited to iso 9001 and
      en46001 and our san diego california facility is accredited to iso 9002
      and en46002  these two sites have third party audits conducted by the iso
      certification bodies at regular intervals

      our newly acquired german manufacturing operation based in munich operates
      in a facility of approximately 24000 square feet this facility is
      accredited to iso 9001 and en46001  the products are primarily flow
      generators that have been developed internally by a small development
      team the manufacturing process consists of major subassemblies produced
      externally by subcontractors and final assembly and test of the finished
      product being performed in house appropriate quality controls monitor and
      measure product assembly and performance

      we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from single
      source suppliers  a reduction or stoppage in supply while a replacement
      supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure our
      components for the replacement part if required would limit our ability
      to manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction
      in sales and profitability

      thirdparty reimbursement

      the cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is
      funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs
      although we do not generally receive payments for

                                       10
page

      our products directly from these payers our success in major markets is
      dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain adequate reimbursement
      for our products

      in the united states our products are purchased primarily by home health
      care dealers hospitals or sleep clinics which then invoice thirdparty
      payers directly domestic thirdparty payers include medicare medicaid
      and corporate health insurance plans these payers may deny reimbursement
      if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with cost
      effective treatment methods or is experimental unnecessary or
      inappropriate the longterm trend towards managed health care could
      control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services
      and products as well as legislative proposals to reform health care may
      result in lower prices for our products

      in the united states we sell our products primarily to home health care
      dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental
      programs and other thirdparty payers directly for reimbursement for our
      products nevertheless we are still subject to laws and regulations
      relating to governmental programs and any violation of these laws and
      regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties including fines

      in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from
      knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing
      remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an
      individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or
      service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program
      such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted
      this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of
      manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws
      similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other
      federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any thirdparty
      payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing
      false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit
      program including private thirdparty payers these laws may apply to
      manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage coding
      and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill thirdparty
      payers we continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that
      our arrangements do not violate these laws liability may still arise from
      the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from
      a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws

      in some foreign markets such as spain france and germany government
      reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our
      products subject however to constraints such as price controls or unit
      sales limitations in australia and in some other foreign markets there
      is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat osa

      service and warranty

      we generally offer onetotwo year limited warranties on our flow
      generator products  warranties on mask systems are for 90 days  in most
      markets we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts
      supplied by us  in the united states home health care dealers generally
      arrange shipment of products to our san diego facility for repair

      we receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons we
      believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with
      levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices we
      provide for warranties and returns based on historical data

      competition

      the markets for our products are highly competitive we believe that the
      principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features
      reliability and price reputation and efficient distribution are also
      important factors

      we compete on a marketbymarket basis with various companies some of
      which have greater financial research manufacturing and marketing
      resources than ourselves in the united states our principal market
      respironics inc devilbiss a division of sunrise medical inc and
      nellcor puritan bennett a subsidiary of tyco inc are the primary
      competitors for our cpap products our principal european competitors are
      also respironics devilbiss and nellcor puritan bennett as well as
      regional european manufacturers the disparity between our resources and
      those of our competitors may increase as a result of the recent trend
      towards consolidation in the health care industry in addition our
      products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed
      to treat osa and other sdb related respiratory conditions the development
      of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our
      products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive resulting in a material
      adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of
      operations

      any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to
      compete for market acceptance and market share an important factor in
      such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive
      products accordingly the relative speed with which we can develop
      products complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and
      supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are expected to
      be important competitive factors in addition our ability to compete will
      continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in
      protecting our patents and other intellectual property

      patents and proprietary rights and related litigation

      through our subsidiaries resmed limited and map medizintechnik fur arzt
      und patient gmbh we own or have licensed rights to 51 issued united
      states patents including 13 design patents and 102 issued foreign
      patents in addition there are 82 pending united states patent
      applications including 4 design patent applications and 197 pending
      foreign patent applications some of these patents and patent applications
      relate to significant aspects and features of our products these include
      us patents relating to cpap devices delay timer system the bubble
      mask and an automated means of varying air pressure based upon a
      patients changing needs during nightly use such as that employed in our
      autoset device

      none of our patents is due to expire in the next five years with the
      exception of five foreign patents due to expire in 2002 and one foreign
      patent in each of the years 2004 and 2005  we believe that the expiration
      of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our
      competitive position

      we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets trade marks and non
      disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights
      resmed limited is pursuing an infringement action against one of its
      competitors and is investigating possible infringement by others  see
      item 3  legal proceedings

      additional litigation may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents
      issued to us to protect our rights or to defend thirdparty claims of
      infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others  patent laws
      regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country
      therefore there

                                       12

      can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved or that
      local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits

      government regulations

      our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to
      safety efficacy and adherence to fda quality system regulation or qsr
      and related manufacturing standards medical device products are subject
      to rigorous fda and other governmental agency regulations in the united
      states and regulations of relevant foreign agencies abroad the fda
      regulates the introduction manufacture advertising labeling packaging
      marketing distribution and record keeping for such products in order to
      ensure that medical products distributed in the united states are safe and
      effective for their intended use in addition the fda is authorized to
      establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety
      and effectiveness of most devices non compliance with applicable
      requirements can result in import detentions fines civil penalties
      injunctions suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals recall or
      seizure of products operating restrictions refusal of the government to
      approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply
      contracts and criminal prosecution

      the fda requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a
      new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a
      section 510k premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval
      or pma prior to it being introduced into the market our products
      currently marketed in the united states are marketed in reliance on 510k
      premarketing clearances as either class i or class ii devices the
      process of obtaining a section 510k clearance generally requires the
      submission of performance data and often clinical data which in some
      cases can be extensive to demonstrate that the device is substantially
      equivalent to a device that was on the market prior to 1976 or to a
      device that has been found by the fda to be substantially equivalent to
      such a pre1976 device as a result fda approval requirements may extend
      the development process for a considerable length of time in addition in
      some cases the fda may require additional review by an advisory panel
      which can further lengthen the process the pma process which is reserved
      for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate
      device and for high risk devices or those that are used to support or
      sustain human life may take several years and requires the submission of
      extensive performance and clinical information

      as a medical device manufacturer all of our domestic and australian
      manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by
      the fda we believe that our design manufacturing and quality control
      procedures are in substantial compliance with the fdas regulatory
      requirements maps facilities are not subject to fda regulation because
      none of maps products is currently marketed in the united states

      sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to
      regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country approval
      for sale of our medical devices in europe is through the ce mark process
      our products where appropriate are ce marked to the european unions
      medical device directive under the ce marketing scheme our products are
      classified as either class i or class ii our devices are listed in the
      united states with fda in australia with the therapeutic goods
      administration or tga and in canada with health canada

item 3 legal proceedings

       we are currently engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and
       defense of certain of our patents

       in january 1995 we filed a complaint in the united states district court
       for the southern district of california seeking monetary damages from and
       injunctive relief against respironics for alleged infringement of three
       of our patents in february 1995 respironics filed a complaint in the
       united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania
       against us seeking a declaratory judgment that respironics does not
       infringe claims of these patents and that our patents are invalid and
       unenforceable the two actions were combined and are proceeding in the
       united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania in
       june 1996 we filed an additional complaint against respironics for
       infringement of a fourth resmed patent and that complaint was
       consolidated with the earlier action as of this date respironics has
       brought three partial summary judgment motions for noninfringement of
       the resmed patents the court has granted each of the motions in
       december 1999 in response to the courts ruling on respironics third
       summary judgment motion the parties jointly stipulated to a dismissal of
       charges of infringement under the fourth resmed patent with us reserving
       the right to reassert the charges in the event of a favorable ruling on
       appeal it is our intention to appeal the summary judgment rulings after
       a final judgment in the consolidated litigation has been entered in the
       district court proceedings

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

        overview

        managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data
        and consolidated financial statements and notes included herein

        we design manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and
        treatment of sleep disordered breathing conditions including
        obstructive sleep apnea our net revenues are generated from the sale of
        our various flow generator devices nasal mask systems accessories and
        other products and to a lesser extent from royalties

        we have invested significant resources in research and development and
        product enhancement since 1989 we have developed several innovations
        to the original cpap device to increase patient comfort and to improve
        ease of product use we have been developing products for automated
        treatment titration and monitoring of osa such as the autoset t flow
        generator our research and development expenses have been subsidized in
        part by grants and tax incentives from the australian federal
        government

        on february 16 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of map
        the total transaction was valued at approximately 70 million paid in
        cash and the assumption of bank debt map designs manufactures and
        distributes medical devices for the diagnosis and treatment of sdb with
        a particular focus on osa

        the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly
        the results of operations of map have been included in our consolidated
        financial statements from february 16 2001 the excess of the purchase
        price over the fair market value of the net identifiable assets acquired
        of 471 million has been recorded as goodwill and is currently being
        amortized on a straight line basis over 20 years

        as a consequence of the map acquisition we incurred nonrecurring
        acquisition charges of 550000 for restructuring of maps unprofitable
        french operations and 17677000 for purchased inprocess research and
        development

        purchased inprocess research and development of 17677000 was
        expensed upon acquisition of map because technological feasibility of
        the products under development had not been established and no further
        alternative uses existed the value of in process technology was
        calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which
        technological feasibility had not been established estimating the costs
        to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable
        products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products
        discounting the net cash flows to present value and applying the
        reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto the discount
        rates used in the analysis were between 27 and 33 and were based on
        the risk profile of the acquired assets

        all purchased research and development projects related to medical
        equipment for the treatment of sleep disordered breathing primarily
        relating to the development of mask interface systems and

                                       19
page

        autotitrating devices for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and
        associated disorders key assumptions used in the analysis included
        gross margins ranging from 70 to 80 as of the date of acquisition
        the mask interface systems are expected to be completed and commercially
        available in 2002 and versions of the autotitrating devices between 2003
        and 2005 these projects have estimated costs to complete totalling
        approximately 20 million

        we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible
        assets were reasonable at the time of acquisition no assurance can be
        given however that the underlying assumptions used to estimate
        expected project revenues development costs or profitability or events
        associated with such projects will transpire as estimated for these
        reasons among others actual results may vary from the projected
        results

        our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our
        income is recognized to date a substantial portion of our income has
        been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate is 34
        during fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 our effective tax rate has fluctuated
        from approximately 34 to approximately 35 these fluctuations have
        resulted from and future effective tax rates will depend upon numerous
        factors including the amount of research and development expenditures
        for which a 125 australian tax deduction is available the level of
        nondeductible expenses and the use of available net operating loss
        carryforward deductions and other tax credits or benefits available to
        us under applicable tax laws


        fiscal year ended june 30 2001 compared to fiscal year ended june 30
        2000

        net revenues net revenues increased in fiscal 2001 to 1552 million
        from 1156 million in fiscal 2000 an increase of 395 million or 34
        this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of
        our flow generators and accessories in north and latin america where net
        revenues increased to 799 million from 627 million and in europe
        where net revenues increased to 605 million from 405 million net
        revenues were unfavorably impacted by a decline in european foreign
        exchange rates

        gross profit gross profit increased in fiscal 2001 to 1048 million
        from 786 million in fiscal 2000 an increase of 262 million or 33
        the increase resulted primarily from increased unit sales during fiscal
        2001 gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 68 consistent
        with fiscal 2000 lower flow generator selling prices were offset by a
        decline in the australian dollar improved manufacturing efficiencies
        and increased sales of higher margin mask system units

        selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
        administrative expenses increased in 2001 to 494 million from 370
        million for 2000 an increase of 124 million or 33 as a percentage
        of net revenues selling general and administrative expenses were
        steady in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 at 32 the gross
        increase in expenses was due primarily to an increase to 471 from 281 in
        the number of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses
        related to the increase in our sales

        research and development expenses research and development expenses
        increased in fiscal 2001 to 111 million from 85 million in fiscal
        2000 an increase of 26 million or 31 as a percentage of net
        revenues research and development expenses remained static in fiscal
        2001 at 7 the dollar increase in research and development expenses was
        due primarily to an increase in clinical trial costs personnel and
        external consultancy fees

        other income expense other income expense improved in fiscal 2001
        to 13 million from 10 million for fiscal 2000 an increase of 03
        million this improvement was due primarily to foreign currency gains
        incurred in our foreign currency hedging structures partially offset by
        interest expense associated with the purchase of map net foreign
        currency gains for fiscal 2001 were 20 million compared to net foreign
        currency losses of 02 million in 2000

        income taxes our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2001 before map
        acquisition charges of 06 million for restructuring costs and in
        process research and development write off of 177 million was 344
        down from 349 for fiscal 2000 this reduction was primarily due to the
        reduction in australian corporate tax rates from 36 to 34 on july 1
        2000 and to additional research and development expenses in australia
        for which we received a 125 deduction for tax purposes


        fiscal year ended june 30 2000 compared to fiscal year ended june 30
        1999

        net revenues net revenues increased in fiscal 2000 to 1156 million
        from 886 million in fiscal 1999 an increase of 27 million or 30
        this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of
        our flow generators and accessories in the americas where net revenues
        increased to 627 million from 510 million and to a lesser extent
        in europe where net revenues increased to 405 million from 302
        million net revenues were unfavorably impacted by a decline in european
        foreign exchange rates and changes in domestic reimbursement regulations
        with respect to our sullivan vpap ii st systems

        gross profit gross profit increased in fiscal 2000 to 786 million
        from 592 million in fiscal 1999 an increase of 194 million or 33
        the increase resulted primarily from increased unit sales during fiscal
        2000 gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased in fiscal
        2000 to 68 from 668 in 1999 the increase was due to improved
        manufacturing efficiencies a decline in the australian dollar and
        increased sales of higher margin mask system units

        administrative expenses increased in 2000 to 370 million from 274
        million for 1999 an increase of 96 million or 35 as a percentage of
        net revenues selling general and administrative expenses increased in
        fiscal 2000 to 32 from 31 for fiscal 1999 the gross increase in

        of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses related to the
        increase in our sales

        research and development expenses research and development expenses

        revenues research and development expenses remained static in fiscal

        was due primarily to an increase in research and development equipment
        personnel and external consultancy fees

        to 10 million from a loss of 07 million for fiscal 1999 a change of
        17 million this improvement was due primarily to reduced losses
        incurred in our foreign currency hedging structures partially offset by
        reduced government grants net foreign currency losses for fiscal 2000
        were 02 million compared to net foreign currency losses of 25
        million in 1999

        income taxes our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2000 increased to
        approximately 349 from approximately 345 for fiscal 1999 this
        increase was primarily due to the high relative taxes incurred in france
        and germany these higher tax rates were partially offset by additional
        research and development expenses in australia for which we received a
        125 deduction for tax purposes

        liquidity and capital resources

        as of june 30 2001 and june 30 2000 we had cash and cash equivalents
        and marketable securities available for sale of approximately 1028
        million and 220 million respectively our working capital
        approximated 1443 million and 476 million respectively at june 30

                                       21

      the increase in working capital balances reflects cash received from our
      150 million subordinated convertible note issuance that occurred on june
      20 2001

      we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash
      generated from operations and to a lesser extent through sales of common
      stock and our 4 convertible subordinated notes issued june 20 2001
      during the fiscal years ended june 30 2001 and 2000 our operations
      generated cash of approximately 295 million and 203 million
      respectively primarily as a result of continued increases in net
      revenues offset in part by increases in accounts receivable inventory
      and prepayments  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities
      available for sale increased to 1028 million at june 30 2001 from 220
      million at june 30 2000 an increase of 808 million  during fiscal
      2001 and 2000 approximately 79 million and 64 million of cash was
      received from the issue of common stock upon exercise of common stock

      our investing activities excluding the purchases and sales of marketable
      securities and business acquisitions for fiscal years 2001 and 2000
      aggregated 306 million and 204 million respectively  the majority of
      the fiscal 2001 investing activities were for the purchase of production
      tooling and equipment office furniture research and development
      equipment and costs associated with the continuing installation of our
      oracle applications computer system  in addition we paid 172 million
      associated with the purchase of the new us headquarters in poway
      california  as a result our june 30 2001 balance sheet reflects an
      increase in net property plant and equipment to approximately 551
      million at june 30 2001 from 366 million at june 30 2000 an increase
      of approximately 185 million

      on february 16 2001 our wholly owned german subsidiary resmed
      beteiligungs gmbh acquired all the common stock of map for total
      consideration including acquisition costs of 554 million we also
      assumed approximately 145 million of bank debt in connection with the
      acquisition

      notes due 2006 an additional 30 million of these notes were issued on

      option  for additional discussion regarding these notes see item 5 
      market for registrants common equity and related stockholder matters and
      note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included with this report

      the results of our international operations are affected by changes in
      exchange rates between currencies  changes in exchange rates may
      negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins
      from international operations  we have a substantial exposure to
      fluctuations in the australian dollar with respect to our manufacturing
      and research activities which is managed through foreign currency option
      contracts

      we expect to satisfy all of our shortterm liquidity requirements through
      a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations

      to no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least
      annually

      sfas 142 provides a sixmonth transitional period from the effective date
      of adoption for us to perform an assessment of whether there is an
      indication that goodwill is impaired to the extent that an indication of
      impairment exists we must perform a second test to measure the amount of
      the

page

      impairment the second test must be performed as soon as possible but no
      later than the end of the fiscal year any impairment measured as of the
      date of adoption will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change
      in accounting principle because of the extensive effort needed to
      complete this assessment we have not determined whether there is any
      indication that goodwill is impaired or estimated the amount of any
      potential impairment

      effective july 1 2001 we will also adopt fasb sfas no 141 business
      combinations  sfas 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be
      used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001  we have
      evaluated the impact of sfas 141 and believe that it will not have a
      material impact on our results of operations financial position or
      liquidity

      sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
      activities sfas no 137 accounting for derivative instruments and
      hedging activities  deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no
      133 an amendment of fasb statement no 133 and sfas 138 accounting
      for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an
      amendment of fasb statement no 133 were issued by the fasb in june 1998
      june 1999 and june 2000 respectively and were effective for our quarter
      ended september 30 2000 sfas 133 standardizes the accounting for
      derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded
      in other contracts under the standard entities are required to carry all
      derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair
      value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or
      losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been
      designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and if so on
      the reason for holding it if certain conditions are met entities may
      elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to
      changes in fair values cash flows or foreign currencies if the hedged
      exposure is a fair value exposure the gain or loss on the derivative
      instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with
      the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk
      being hedged if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure the
      effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
      reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside
      earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
      transaction affects earnings any amounts excluded from the assessment of
      hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss
      is reported in earnings immediately accounting for foreign currency
      hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges
      if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge the gain or
      loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change

      due to the restrictive definition of hedge effectiveness contained in sfas
      133 our hedging contracts do not have hedge effectiveness and are
      therefore marked to market with resulting gains or losses being recognized
      in earnings in the period of change  this was consistent with our
      previous accounting policy and therefore adoption of sfas 133 did not have
      a material impact on our financial position or results of operation

      in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission issued staff
      accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in financial
      statements which was effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2001
      sab 101 requires among other things that license and other upfront fees
      be recognized over the term of the agreement unless the fees are in
      exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the
      culmination of a separate earnings process  this did not have a material
      impact on our financial position or results of operation

      in march 2000 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 44 fin 44
      accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an
      interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 25  fin 44 was
      generally effective july 1 2000  the application of fin 44 did not have
      a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and business risks

        foreign currency market risk

        our functional currency is the us dollar although we transact business
        in various foreign currencies including a number of major european
        currencies as well as the australian dollar we have significant foreign
        currency exposure through both our australian manufacturing activities
        and international sales operations

        we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased
        currency options to hedge foreigncurrencydenominated financial assets
        liabilities and manufacturing expenditure the goal of this hedging
        program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on
        our foreign currency exposures denominated in euros and the australian
        dollar under this program increases or decreases in our foreign
        currencydenominated financial assets liabilities and firm commitments
        are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments

        the table below provides information about our foreign currency
        derivative financial instruments and presents such information in us
        dollar equivalents the table summarizes information on instruments and
        transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates
        including foreign currency call options held at june 30 2001 the table
        presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by
        contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial
        instruments these notional amounts generally are used to calculate
        payments to be exchanged under the options contracts

        interest rate risk

        we are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates
        affecting the return on investments

        at june 30 2001 we maintained a portion of our cash and cash
        equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three
        months or less we maintain a shortterm investment portfolio containing
        financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of
        greater than three months but less than twelve months these financial
        instruments principally comprised of corporate obligations are subject
        to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates
        increase a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during
        the twelve months ended june 30 2001 would have resulted in
        approximately 02 million change in pretax income we do not use
        derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

      statements and information that are based on the beliefs of our management
      as well as estimates and assumptions made by and information currently
      available to our management the words believe expect anticipate
      estimate plan future and other similar expressions generally
      identify forwardlooking statements including in particular statements
      regarding the development and approval of new products and product
      applications market expansion and pending litigation these forward
      looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the
      private securities litigation reform act of 1995  you are cautioned not
      to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements such forward
      looking statements reflect the views of our management at the time such
      statements are made and are subject to a number of risks uncertainties
      estimates and assumptions including without limitation and in addition
      to those identified in the text surrounding such statements those
      identified below and elsewhere in this report  in addition important
      factors to consider in evaluating such forwardlooking statements include
      changes or developments in social economic market legal or regulatory
      circumstances changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability
      to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy
      generally the emergence of new or growing competitors the actions or
      omissions of third parties including suppliers customers competitors
      and governmental authorities and various other factors should any one or
      more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or the underlying
      estimates or assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary
      significantly from those expressed in such forwardlooking statements and
      there can be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements contained in
      this report will in fact occur

      the risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial
      condition or results of operations include the following

      our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our
      business

      the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are
      characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology
      our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to
      develop innovative new products and to be the first to market with those
      products the development of innovative new products by our competitors or
      the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the
      conditions that our products treat could result in our products becoming
      noncompetitive or obsolete

      additionally some of our competitors have greater financial research and
      development manufacturing and marketing resources than we do the past
      several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care
      industry and in the markets for our products industry consolidation could
      result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources
      or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater
      resources than ours this competition could increase pressure on us to
      reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase
      our spending on research and development and sales and marketing if we
      are unable to develop innovative new products maintain competitive
      pricing and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as
      those of our competitors our sales or gross margins could decrease which
      would harm our business

      our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of
      home health care products and sleep clinics

      we market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep
      clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders we believe that home
      health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in
      determining which brand of cpap product a patient will use for example
      in the united states when a physician at a sleep clinic prescribes the
      use of a cpap product the patient typically purchases the product from a
      home health care dealer the physician may or may not prescribe a specific
      brand of cpap product if a specific brand is prescribed we believe the
      brand prescribed depends upon the brand of cpap product that is used in
      the sleep clinic if a specific brand is not prescribed the home health
      care dealer may recommend a specific brand occasionally even if the
      physician prescribes a specific brand a home health care dealer may
      substitute a competitive cpap product for the patient we have limited
      resources to market to the more than 2000 us sleep clinics and the more
      than 4000 home health care dealer branch locations most of which use
      sell or recommend several brands of cpap products in addition home
      health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and
      thirdparty reimbursement have declined for home care products and home
      health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of
      time to pay for products purchased from us we cannot assure you that
      sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products or that
      home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing
      products when a prescription specifying our products has been written the
      success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to
      home health care dealers and sleep clinics and to ensure that our products
      are properly marketed and sold by these third parties

      we intend to expand our marketing activities to target the population with
      a predisposition to sdb as well as primary care physicians and
      specialists we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be
      successful in increasing awareness of our products

      if we are unable to support our continued growth our business could
      suffer

      we have experienced rapid and substantial growth as we continue to grow
      the complexity of our operations increases placing greater demands on our
      management our ability to manage our growth effectively depends upon our
      ability to implement and improve our financial and management information
      systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business
      unexpected difficulties during expansion the failure to attract and
      retain qualified employees the failure to successfully replace or upgrade
      our management information systems the failure to manage costs or our
      inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion
      could cause our growth to stop if we fail to manage our growth our
      business could suffer

      if we fail to integrate our recent acquisition in germany with our
      operations our business could suffer

      on february 16 2001 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of map
      located near munich germany we are currently in the process of
      integrating our operations with those of map the integration requires
      significant efforts from each company we may find it difficult to
      integrate the operations of map map personnel may leave map because of
      the acquisition and map licensees distributors or suppliers may terminate
      their arrangements with map or demand amended terms to these
      arrangements additionally our management may have their attention
      diverted while trying to integrate the two companies this diversion or
      these difficulties in integration could have an adverse impact on us if
      we are not able to successfully integrate the operations of map we may
      not realize the anticipated benefits of the map acquisition

      we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states
      and sell a significant portion of our products in nonus markets
      subjecting us to various risks relating to international activities that
      could adversely affect our overall profitability

      sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 48
      46 and 43 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999
      respectively as a result of the map acquisition we expect that sales
      within these areas will account for over 50 of our net revenues in the
      foreseeable future our sales outside of north america and our operations
      in europe australia and asia are subject to several difficulties and
      risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our domestic
      operations including

        fluctuations in currency exchange rates

        tariffs and other trade barriers

        compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations

        reduction in third party payer reimbursement for our products

        inability to obtain import licenses

        changes in trade policies and in domestic and foreign tax policies

        possible changes in export or import restrictions and

        the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with
         potentially adverse effects

      fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines
      in our reported sales and earnings

      since our international sales and a significant portion of our
      manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in us
      dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in
      foreign exchange rates we had foreign currency transaction losses in
      recent periods and may have further losses in the future we expect that
      international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our
      business and that a significant portion of our manufacturing costs will
      continue to be denominated in australian dollars

      government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our
      products which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for
      our products

      our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to
      which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from
      government health administration authorities private health insurers and
      other organizations these third party payors are increasingly challenging
      the prices charged for medical products and services therefore even if a
      product is approved for marketing we cannot assure you that reimbursement
      will be allowed for such product or that the reimbursement amount will be
      adequate or if adequate will not subsequently be reduced for example
      in some markets such as spain france and germany government
      reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our
      products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit
      sales limitations in other markets such as australia and the united
      kingdom there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that
      treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions
      additionally future legislation or regulation concerning the health care
      industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement
      particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers reimbursement
      rights may harm our business as we continue to develop new products
      those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement if at all
      until they are approved for marketing

                                       27

      in the united states we sell our products primarily to home health care
      dealers and to sleep clinics we do not file claims and bill governmental
      programs and other third party payors directly for reimbursement for our
      products however we are still subject to laws and regulations relating
      to governmental reimbursement programs particularly medicaid and
      medicare

      in particular the federal antikickback law prohibits persons from
      knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing
      remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an
      individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or
      service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program
      such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government has interpreted
      this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of
      manufacturers and distributors like us many states have adopted laws
      similar to the federal antikickback law we are also subject to other
      federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party
      payer these laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing
      false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit
      program including private third party payors these laws may apply to
      manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage
      coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third
      party payors any violation of these laws and regulations could result in
      civil and criminal penalties including fines

      complying with fda and other regulations is an expensive and time
      consuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial
      penalties

      we are subject to various federal state local and international
      regulations regarding the testing manufacture distribution marketing
      promotion record keeping and reporting of our products in particular
      our failure to comply with fda regulations could result in among other
      things recalls of our products substantial fines andor criminal charges
      against us and our employees

      product sales introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled
      as a result of the fda or similar foreign regulations which could cause
      our sales to decline

      before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states we
      must obtain fda clearance which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming
      process we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our
      products in the united states under section 510k of the federal food
      drug and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the 510k
      clearance process we have modified some of our 510k approved products
      without submitting new 510k notices which we do not believe were
      required however if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit
      new 510k notifications for modifications to our existing products we
      may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the
      510k notification any new product introduction or existing product
      modification could be subjected to a lengthier more rigorous fda
      examination process for example in certain cases we may need to conduct
      clinical trials of a new product prior to submitting a 510k notice
      additionally we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our
      products the requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay
      product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda
      compliance marketing and sale of our products outside the united states
      are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals and if we fail to
      obtain these regulatory approvals our sales could suffer we cannot
      assure you that any new products we develop will receive required
      regulatory approvals from us or foreign regulatory agencies

                                       28
page

      off label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties

      clearance under section 510k only permits us to market our products for
      the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda we may request
      additional label indications for our current products and the fda may
      deny those requests outright require additional expensive clinical data
      to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the
      intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance if the
      fda determines that we have marketed our products for off label use we
      could be subject to fines injunctions or other penalties

      disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers
      could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability

      we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from single
      source suppliers we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would
      be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or
      in the alternative that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to
      integrate the replacement part a reduction or stoppage in supply while a
      replacement supplier reconfigures its components or while we reconfigure
      our components for the replacement part would limit our ability to
      manufacture our devices which could result in a significant reduction in
      sales and profitability we cannot assure you that our inventories would
      be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption
      of supply

      our intellectual property may not protect our products and our products
      may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties

      we rely on a combination of patents trade secrets and nondisclosure
      agreements to protect our intellectual property our success depends in
      part on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign
      patent protection for our products their uses and our processes to
      preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the
      proprietary rights of third parties we have a number of pending patent
      applications and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any
      of these applications we do not know whether any of the claims in our
      issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any
      significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be
      commercially valuable legal standards regarding the validity of patents
      and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving and there is no
      consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims
      additionally there may be third party patents patent applications and
      other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which
      are not known to us and that block or compete with our products

      we face the risks that

        third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights

        our nondisclosure agreements will be breached

        we will not have adequate remedies for infringement

        our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by
         our competitors or

        any third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of
         our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in
         order for us to be able to market some of our products

      we are currently engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and
      defense of five of our patents additional litigation may be necessary to
      enforce patents issued to us to protect our proprietary

      rights or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon
      proprietary rights of others the defense and prosecution of patent
      claims including these pending claims as well as participation in other
      interparty proceedings can be expensive and time consuming even in
      those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us if the outcome of
      any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse we could be
      subject to significant liabilities to third parties could be required to
      obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of
      the affected products additionally the laws regarding the enforceability
      of patents vary from country to country and we cannot assure you that any
      patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved or that local laws will
      provide us with consistent rights and benefits

      we are subject to product liability claims that may exceed the scope and
      amount of our insurance coverage which would expose us to liability for
      uninsured claims

      we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the
      design manufacture and marketing of medical devices any product
      liability claim brought against us with or without merit could result in
      the increase of our product liability insurance rates in addition we
      would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy
      limits our insurance policies have various exclusions and thus we may be
      subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance
      coverage in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any
      award we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate
      or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance
      insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain and we cannot
      assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms
      acceptable to us or at all a successful product liability claim brought
      against us in excess of our insurance coverage if any may require us to
      pay substantial amounts which could harm our business

      our business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our
      management

      we are dependent upon the continued services of key members of our senior
      management and a limited number of key employees and consultants the loss
      of the services of any one of these individuals could significantly
      disrupt our operations additionally our future success will depend
      among other factors on our ability to continue to hire and retain the
      necessary qualified scientific technical and managerial personnel we
      compete for such personnel with numerous other companies academic
      institutions and organizations

      our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety
      of reasons

      our operating results have from time to time fluctuated on a quarterly
      basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future these
      fluctuations may result from a number of factors including

        the introduction of new products by us or our competitors

        the geographic mix of product sales

        the success of our marketing efforts in new regions

        changes in third party reimbursement

        timing of regulatory clearances and approvals

        timing of orders by distributors

        expenditures incurred for research and development

        competitive pricing in different regions

        seasonality

        the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs and

        the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses

      we are subject to an ongoing tax audit the results of which may require
      significant tax adjustments

      we are subject to an ongoing audit of our tax returns for the years 1995
      through 1998 which began in february 1998 the irs may disagree with our
      tax positions on such returns and if challenged by the irs our tax
      positions may not be sustained by the courts as a result of these audits
      we may be required to make certain tax adjustments and pay additional
      taxes and fines that may be significant and have a negative impact on our
      result of operations

      if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we
      will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of
      time and our sales will decline

      we manufacture a significant portion of our products in our facilities in
      australia these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to
      produce our products would be costly to replace and could require
      substantial lead time to repair or replace the facilities may be affected
      by natural or man made disasters and in the event it was affected by a
      disaster we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers
      although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our
      property and the disruption of our business from casualties such
      insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and
      may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

      delaware law provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan
      could make the acquisition of our company by another company more
      difficult

      provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of
      delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be
      beneficial to us or our securityholders in particular our board of
      directors is divided into three classes serving for staggered threeyear
      terms because of this classification it will require at least two annual
      meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of
      directors

      additionally our board of directors has the authority to issue up to
      2000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price rights
      preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of
      those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders under our
      stockholders rights plan we have also issued purchase rights to the
      holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our
      series a junior participating preferred stock at a discount under certain
      circumstances the rights of the holders of our common stock will be
      subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of
      any preferred stock that may be issued in the future the issuance of
      preferred stock may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a
      change in control may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium
      over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the
      market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the
      holders of our common stock

      you may not be able to enforce the judgments of us courts against some
      of our assets or officers and directors

      a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states
      additionally two of our six directors and three of our eight officers
      reside outside the united states along with all or a substantial portion
      of the assets of these persons as a result it may not be possible for
      investors to enforce judgments of us courts relating to any liabilities
      under us securities laws against our assets those persons or their
      assets  in addition we have been advised by our australian counsel

                                       31

         that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims

    under development had not been established and no further alternative uses
    existed  the value of in process technology was calculated by identifying
    research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been
    established estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process
    technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net
    cash flows from such products discounting the net cash flows to present
    value and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects
    thereto  the discount rates used in the analysis were between 27 and 33
    and were based on the risk profile of the acquired assets

    development of mask interface systems and autotitrating devices for the

    the company believes that the assumptions used to value the acquired
    intangible assets were reasonable at the time of acquisition  no assurance
    can be given however that the underlying assumptions used to estimate
    expected project revenues development costs or profitability or events
    associated with such projects will transpire as estimated  for these
    reasons among others actual results may vary from the projected results

    combined results of operations of the company and map as if the acquisition
    had occurred as of the beginning of the years ended june 30 2001 and 2000
    respectively and after giving effect to certain adjustments including
    amortization of goodwill and increased interest expense associated with debt
    funding the acquisition the proforma financial information does not
    necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred had
    the company and map constituted a single entity during such years
